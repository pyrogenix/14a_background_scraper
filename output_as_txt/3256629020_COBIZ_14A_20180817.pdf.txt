MERGER PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

August 17, 2018

Dear Shareholder:

On June 17, 2018, CoBiz Financial Inc. (which we refer to as “CoBiz”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (which we refer to as the “merger
agreement”) with BOK Financial Corporation (which we refer to as “BOK”). Under the merger agreement, CoBiz will merge with and into BOK
Merger Corporation Number Sixteen (which we refer to as “Merger Sub”), with Merger Sub as the surviving corporation, in a transaction that we refer
to as the “merger”. Immediately following the merger, or at such later time as BOK may determine, CoBiz’s wholly-owned subsidiary, CoBiz Bank, will
merge with and into BOK’s wholly-owned subsidiary, BOKF, National Association, with BOKF, National Association as the surviving bank.

Under the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, each shareholder of CoBiz, as of the record date, will have the right to receive 0.17 shares of
BOK common stock and $5.70 in cash for each share of CoBiz common stock (which we refer to as the “merger consideration”) held immediately prior
to the merger. The value of the merger consideration will depend on the market price of BOK common stock on the effective date of the merger.

Based on the closing price of BOK common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (which we refer to as “NASDAQ”) on June 15, 2018, the last
trading day before public announcement of the merger, the value of the per share merger consideration payable to holders of CoBiz common stock
would be $23.02. Based on the closing price of BOK common stock on NASDAQ on August 14, 2018, the last practicable trading date before the date
of the attached proxy statement/prospectus, the value of the per share merger consideration payable to holders of CoBiz common stock would be $22.46.
Based on the number of shares of CoBiz common stock outstanding and the number of shares of CoBiz common stock issuable pursuant to outstanding
CoBiz stock options and restricted stock awards, in each case as of August 14, 2018, the total number of shares of BOK common stock expected to be
issued in connection with the merger is approximately 7.2 million. In addition, based on the number of issued and outstanding shares of BOK common
stock and CoBiz common stock on August 14, 2018, and based on the exchange ratio of 0.17, holders of shares of CoBiz common stock as of
immediately prior to the closing of the merger will hold, in the aggregate, approximately 9.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of BOK common
stock immediately following the closing of the merger (without giving effect to any BOK common stock held by CoBiz’s shareholders prior to the
merger).

CoBiz will hold a special meeting of its shareholders in connection with the merger. CoBiz’s shareholders will be asked to vote to approve the merger
agreement and approve related matters, as described in the attached proxy statement/prospectus. The merger cannot be completed unless, among other
things, the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of CoBiz common stock entitled to be cast on the proposal approve the merger
agreement.

The special meeting of shareholders of CoBiz will be held at CoBiz’s office at 1401 Lawrence Street, Suite 1200, Denver, Colorado 80202 on
September 27, 2018 at 8:00 a.m., local time.

CoBiz’s board of directors has unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and
recommends that you vote “FOR” the approval of the merger agreement and “FOR” the other matters to be considered at the special meeting.

Table of Contents

The attached proxy statement/prospectus, which serves as the proxy statement for the special meeting of the shareholders of CoBiz and the prospectus
for the shares of BOK common stock to be issued in the merger, includes detailed information about the special meeting, the merger and the documents
related to the merger. We urge you to read the entire proxy statement/prospectus carefully, including the discussion of the risks related to the
merger and owning BOK common stock after the merger in the section titled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 22. You can also obtain
information about CoBiz and BOK from documents that have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that are incorporated
in the proxy statement/prospectus by reference.

Shares of BOK common stock are listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “BOKF.” Shares of CoBiz common stock are listed on NASDAQ under the
symbol “COBZ.” On August 14, 2018, the last practicable trading day prior to the date of the attached proxy statement/prospectus, the last sales price of
BOKF common stock was $98.59 per share, and the last sales price of CoBiz common stock was $22.16 per share. You should obtain current market
quotations for both BOK common stock and CoBiz common stock.

Your vote is important. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please take the time to vote by completing and mailing the enclosed
proxy card or by submitting a proxy through the Internet or by telephone as described on the enclosed instructions as soon as possible to make sure your
shares are represented at the special meeting. If you submit a properly signed proxy card without indicating how you want to vote, your proxy will be
counted as a vote “FOR” the approval of the merger agreement and “FOR” the other matters to be considered at the special meeting. The failure to vote
by submitting your proxy or attending the special meeting and voting in person will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the merger
agreement. Submitting a proxy now will NOT prevent you from being able to vote in person at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street
name,” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote in accordance with the voting
instruction form you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Sincerely,
 

Steven Bangert
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the securities to be issued
in the merger or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this proxy statement/prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal
offense.

The shares of BOK’s common stock to be issued in the merger are not savings accounts, deposits or other obligations of any bank or savings
association and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency.

This proxy statement/prospectus is dated August 17, 2018, and is first being mailed to CoBiz’s shareholders on or about August 20, 2018.

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

August 17, 2018

To the Shareholders of CoBiz Financial Inc.:

Notice is hereby given that a special meeting of shareholders of CoBiz Financial Inc., a Colorado corporation (which we refer to as “CoBiz”), will be
held at CoBiz’s office at 1401 Lawrence Street, Suite 1200, Denver, Colorado 80202 on September 27, 2018 at 8:00 a.m., local time, for the purpose of
considering and voting upon the following matters:
 

 
1. the approval of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 17, 2018 (which we refer to as the “merger agreement”), by and

among CoBiz, BOK Financial Corporation and BOKF Merger Corporation Number Sixteen (which we refer to as the “merger
proposal”);

 

 
2. the approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that certain executive officers of CoBiz may receive that is

based on or otherwise relates to the merger (which we refer to as the “compensation proposal”); and
 

 
3. the approval of one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of

the merger proposal (which we refer to as the “adjournment proposal”).

CoBiz’s board of directors has fixed the close of business on August 14, 2018 as the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to notice of
and to vote at the special meeting, and only shareholders of record on said date will be entitled to receive notice of and to vote at said meeting.

The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of CoBiz common stock entitled to be cast on the proposal at the
special meeting is required to approve the merger proposal. Approval of the compensation proposal and approval of the adjournment proposal require
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting. CoBiz’s shareholders must approve the merger proposal
in order for the merger to occur. CoBiz’s shareholders are not, however, required to approve the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal in
order for the merger to occur. If CoBiz’s shareholders fail to approve the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal, but approve the merger
proposal, the merger may nonetheless occur.

CoBiz’s board of directors has unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and
recommends that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

By Order of the Board of Directors
 

Richard J. Dalton
Corporate Secretary

proxy card or by submitting a proxy through the Internet or by telephone as described on the enclosed instructions as soon as possible to make sure your
shares are represented at the special meeting. If you submit a properly signed proxy card without indicating how you want to vote, your proxy will be
counted as a vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal. The failure to vote by
submitting your proxy or attending the special meeting and voting in person will have the same effect as a vote against approval of the merger
agreement. Submitting a proxy now will NOT prevent you from being able to vote in person at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street
name,” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote in accordance with the voting

SUMMARY

This summary highlights selected information from this proxy statement/prospectus. It does not contain all of the information that may be important
to you. We urge you to read carefully the entire document and the other documents to which this proxy statement/prospectus refers in order to fully
understand the merger and the related transactions. For more information, see “Where You Can Find More Information,” beginning on page 102.
Each item in this summary refers to the page of this proxy statement/prospectus on which that subject is discussed in more detail.

The Merger (page 70)

BOK, Merger Sub and CoBiz have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 17, 2018 (which we refer to as the “merger
agreement”). Under the merger agreement, CoBiz will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the surviving corporation, in a
transaction that we refer to as the “merger”. The merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A. Please carefully read
the merger agreement as it is the legal document that governs the merger.

What CoBiz’s Shareholders Will Receive in the Merger (page 70)

If the merger is completed, each outstanding share of CoBiz common stock (except for dissenting shares and specified shares of CoBiz common
stock held by CoBiz, BOK or Merger Sub (which specified shares will be cancelled)) held immediately prior to the merger will be converted into
the right to receive 0.17 shares of BOK common stock (which we refer to as the “exchange ratio”) and $5.70 in cash (which we refer to collectively
as the “merger consideration”).

The following table shows the closing sales prices of CoBiz common stock and BOK common stock as reported on NASDAQ on June 15, 2018,
the last full trading day before the public announcement of the signing of the merger agreement and on August 14, 2018, the last practicable trading
date before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. This table also shows the implied value of the merger consideration per share of CoBiz
common stock, calculated by multiplying the closing sales prices of BOK common stock on those dates by the exchange ratio of 0.17 shares of
BOK common stock per share of CoBiz common stock and then adding the cash consideration of $5.70. The value of the merger consideration that
you will receive for each share of CoBiz common stock will depend on the price per share of BOK common stock at the time you receive the BOK
common stock. Therefore, the value of the merger consideration may be different than its estimated value based on the current price of BOK
common stock or the price of BOK common stock at the time of the special meeting.

Common Stock

August 14, 2018   $ 22.16   $ 98.59   $ 5.70   $ 22.46 

What Holders of CoBiz Stock Options and Restricted Stock Awards Will Receive in the Merger (page 72)

At the effective time of the merger, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, each option granted by CoBiz to purchase shares
of CoBiz common stock under the company stock plan, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
effective time (which we refer to as a “stock option”), shall fully vest and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive
the merger consideration with respect to a number of shares of CoBiz common stock equal to (x) the product of (A) the number of shares of CoBiz
common stock subject to such stock option multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of (i) the sum of the per share stock consideration and the per share
cash consideration over (ii) the exercise

Table of Contents

price per share, divided by (y) the sum of the per share stock consideration and the per share cash consideration. The “per share stock
consideration” means the exchange ratio of 0.17 times the average of the closing-sale prices of BOK common stock for the five full trading days
ending on the trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger. The “per share cash consideration” means $5.70 in cash. Any
stock option that has an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the sum of the per share stock consideration plus the per share cash
consideration will be cancelled in exchange for no consideration.

At the effective time of the merger, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, each CoBiz restricted stock award (which we refer
to as a “restricted stock award”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall fully vest and shall be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive merger consideration with respect to the number of shares of CoBiz common stock subject to such restricted
stock award.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger (page 85)

In accordance with current accounting guidance, the merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 62)

The obligation of BOK and CoBiz to complete the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of legal opinions from their respective counsel to the
effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

If the merger qualifies as a reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes, U.S. holders of CoBiz common stock who receive a
combination of shares of BOK common stock and cash, other than cash instead of a fractional BOK common share, in exchange for their CoBiz
common stock, will recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the amount by which the sum of the fair market value of
the shares of BOK common stock and cash (other than cash received instead of a fractional BOK common share) received by such holder in
exchange for its shares of CoBiz common stock exceeds the holder’s adjusted basis in its shares of CoBiz common stock, and (y) the amount of
cash (other than cash received instead of fractional shares of BOK common stock) received by such holder in exchange for its shares of CoBiz
common stock. Generally, any gain recognized upon the exchange will be capital gain, and any such capital gain will be long-term capital gain if
the holding period for such shares of CoBiz common stock is more than one year. Depending on certain facts specific to you, gain could instead be
characterized as ordinary dividend income.

For more information, see “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,” beginning on page 62.

Opinion of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Financial Advisor to CoBiz (page 47)

In connection with the merger, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (“BofA Merrill Lynch”), CoBiz’s financial advisor, delivered to
CoBiz’s board of directors a written opinion, dated June 17, 2018, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion,
to the holders of CoBiz common stock of the merger consideration to be received by such holders. The full text of the written opinion, dated
June 17, 2018, of BofA Merrill Lynch, which describes, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and
limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex D to this document and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. BofA Merrill
Lynch provided its opinion to CoBiz’s board of directors (in its capacity as such) for the benefit and use of CoBiz’s board of directors in connection
with and for purposes of its evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial point of view. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address
any other aspect of the merger and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative

merits of the merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to CoBiz or in which CoBiz might engage or as to the
underlying business decision of CoBiz to proceed with or effect the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to
any shareholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the proposed merger or any other matter.

Special Meeting of CoBiz’s Shareholders (page 31)

CoBiz will hold its special meeting of shareholders at CoBiz’s office at 1401 Lawrence Street, Suite 1200, Denver, Colorado 80202 on September
27, 2018 at 8:00 a.m., local time. At the special meeting you will be asked to vote for the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby and to approve related matters, as described beginning on page 36 in “The Proposals.”

You can vote at the CoBiz special meeting of shareholders if you owned CoBiz common stock at the close of business on August 14, 2018. As of
that date, there were approximately 42,397,697 shares of CoBiz common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, approximately 3,509,557 of which,
or 8.3%, were owned beneficially or of record by directors and officers of CoBiz. You can cast one vote for each share of CoBiz common stock that
you owned on that date.

Shareholders representing at least a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the special meeting must be present at the special meeting, either in
person or by proxy, for there to be a quorum at the special meeting.

The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of CoBiz common stock entitled to be cast on the proposal at the
special meeting is required to approve the merger agreement. Assuming a quorum is present, approval of the compensation that certain executive
officers of CoBiz may receive that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger (which we refer to as the “compensation proposal”) and approval
of one or more adjournments of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of the merger proposal (which
we refer to as the “adjournment proposal”) require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast at the special meeting.
CoBiz’s shareholders must approve the merger proposal in order for the merger to occur. CoBiz’s shareholders are not, however, required to
approve the compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal in order for the merger to occur. If CoBiz’s shareholders fail to approve the
compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal, but approve the merger proposal, the merger may nonetheless occur.

Recommendation of CoBiz’s Board of Directors (page 43)

CoBiz’s board of directors has determined that the merger is in the best interests of CoBiz and its shareholders. CoBiz’s board of directors
unanimously recommends that CoBiz’s shareholders vote “FOR” the approval of the merger agreement and “FOR” the other matters to be
considered at the special meeting.

Interests of CoBiz’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 54)

In considering the recommendation of CoBiz’s board of directors with respect to the merger, CoBiz’s shareholders should be aware that the
directors and executive officers have certain interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of CoBiz’s
shareholders generally. CoBiz’s board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in making its
recommendation that CoBiz’s shareholders vote to approve the merger agreement.

These interests include:
 

 

•  any outstanding stock options (including those held by executive officers) will vest upon the effective time of the merger and be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to the number of shares of CoBiz common stock
based on (x) the number of shares of CoBiz common stock subject to such stock option multiplied by (y) the merger consideration less
the applicable exercise price;

conversion date, with participants (which may include executive officers) and amounts to be mutually agreed between CoBiz and BOK;

occurs prior to the payment of bonuses in respect of any fiscal year, pay continuing CoBiz employees (including executive officers)
annual bonuses in cash in respect of such fiscal year in the ordinary course based on actual performance (with any subjective
performance criteria deemed achieved at 100% of target levels), including a pro rata bonus payment with respect to those employees
whose employment terminates either immediately prior to the closing or following closing and prior to the end of the fiscal year;

 

 
•  CoBiz’s executive officers are party to employment agreements that provide for severance benefits upon certain qualifying terminations

of employment following the effective time of the merger;
 

 
•  CoBiz’s Chief Executive Officer, Steven Bangert, has been offered the role of Vice Chairman – Colorado of BOKF NA following the

effective time of the merger and has entered into an employment contract which is effective upon the closing of the merger;
 

 
•  under the merger agreement, at or prior to the effective time of the merger, Mr. Bangert, or if Mr. Bangert is unable to be appointed,

such other person mutually agreed upon by CoBiz and BOK, will be appointed to the board of directors of BOK and BOKF, National
Association; and

 

 •  CoBiz’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the merger agreement.

For a more complete description of these interests, see “The Merger—Interests of CoBiz’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”
beginning on page 54.

BOK’s Board of Directors after the Merger (page 54)

The Board of Directors of BOK shall remain unchanged after the merger except that Steven Bangert shall be elected to the Board of Directors of
BOK upon the closing of the merger.

Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers (page 77)

Under the terms of the merger agreement, CoBiz has agreed not to initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or
proposals with respect to, or engage or participate in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to,
or have or participate in any discussions with any person relating to, or enter into any binding acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other
definitive transaction agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement described in this paragraph) relating to, any acquisition proposal.
Notwithstanding these restrictions, the merger agreement provides that, under specified circumstances, in response to an unsolicited bona fide
written acquisition proposal which, in the good faith judgment of the CoBiz Board of Directors (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel
and financial advisors), is or is more likely than not to result in a proposal which is superior to the merger with BOK, if the CoBiz Board of
Directors determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and

financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law,
CoBiz may furnish nonpublic information or data regarding CoBiz and participate in discussions or negotiations with such third party, provided
that prior to providing any such nonpublic information or data, CoBiz will have provided such information to BOK and entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such third party on material terms no less favorable to it than the confidentiality agreement between CoBiz and
BOK. For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—Covenants and Agreements,” beginning on page 72.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (page 65)

Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, both CoBiz and BOK have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as
practicable all regulatory approvals necessary or advisable to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the
merger and the merger of CoBiz Bank with and into BOKF Bank, with BOKF Bank as the surviving bank (which we refer to as the “bank
merger”), and comply with the terms and conditions of such approvals. These approvals include approvals from the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (which we refer to as the “Federal Reserve Board”) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (which we refer to
as the “OCC”). BOKF has filed applications to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. The completion of the merger is subject to the expiration
of certain waiting periods and other requirements. Although BOK does not know of any reason why it would not be able to obtain the necessary
regulatory approvals in a timely manner, BOK cannot be certain when or if it will obtain them or, if obtained, whether they will contain terms,
conditions or restrictions not currently contemplated that will be detrimental to or have a material adverse effect on BOK or its subsidiaries after
the completion of the merger. For more information regarding the regulatory approvals to which completion of the merger and bank merger are
subject, see “The Merger—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger,” beginning on page 65.

Conditions to Complete the Merger (page 81)

The obligations of BOK and CoBiz to complete the merger are each subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, if permitted) of the following conditions:
 

 •  receipt of the requisite approval of the CoBiz common shareholders of the merger agreement;
 

 •  approval for the listing on NASDAQ of the BOK common stock to be issued in connection with the merger;
 

 
•  the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part, and the absence of a stop

order or proceeding initiated or threatened by the SEC for that purpose;
 

 
•  the receipt of all required regulatory approvals which are necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger

agreement and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods;
 

 
•  the absence of any order, injunction, decree, statute, rule, regulation or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the closing of, or

which prohibits or makes illegal the closing of, the merger;
 

 
•  the accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the closing date of the

merger, other than, in most cases, those failures to be true and correct that would not reasonably be likely to have a material adverse
effect on the other party;

 

 
•  the prior performance in all material respects by the other party of the obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to the

closing date of the merger; and
 

 •  receipt by each party of an opinion from its counsel as to certain tax matters.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 82)

The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before or after approval of the merger
agreement by CoBiz’s shareholders:
 

 •  by mutual written consent of BOK and CoBiz;
 

 

•  by either BOK or CoBiz, if a required regulatory approval is denied by final, non-appealable action, or if a governmental entity
has issued a final, non-appealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, unless the failure to obtain a required regulatory approval is due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party
set forth in the agreement;

 

 
•  by either BOK or CoBiz, if the merger has not closed by the close of business on June 17, 2019 (which we refer to as the

“termination date”), unless the failure to close by the termination date is due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate the
merger agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in the agreement;

 

 

•  by either BOK or CoBiz, if there is a breach by the other party that would, individually or in the aggregate with other breaches
by such party, result in the failure of a closing condition, unless the breach is cured by the earlier of the termination date and 45
days following written notice of the breach (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of the merger
agreement);

 

 

•  by BOK, if, (i) prior to the approval by the CoBiz shareholders of the merger agreement, the CoBiz Board of Directors
(A) submits the merger agreement to its shareholders without a recommendation for approval, or otherwise withdraws or
materially and adversely modifies its recommendation for approval (or publicly discloses an intention to do so), or recommends
to its shareholders an acquisition proposal other than the merger, or (B) breaches its obligation to call a shareholder meeting and
recommend to its shareholders, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the approval of the merger agreement or
materially breaches its obligation to refrain from soliciting alternative acquisition proposals or (ii) a tender offer or exchange
offer for 25% or more of CoBiz’s outstanding shares of common stock is commenced (other than by BOK or its subsidiaries)
and the CoBiz Board of Directors recommends that CoBiz’s shareholders tender or exchange their shares (or fails to recommend
a rejection of such tender or exchange offer within ten business days); or

 

 

•  by CoBiz, if, (i) the average closing price of BOK common stock during the twenty trading day period ending on the third
trading day preceding the closing date is less than its pre-merger announcement price by 17.5% or more, and (ii) BOK’s
common stock underperforms the NASDAQ Bank Index by 17.5%, unless BOK were to elect to make a compensating
adjustment to the exchange ratio.

For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—Termination; Termination Fee,” beginning on page 82.

Termination Fee (page 82)

If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including certain circumstances involving alternative acquisition proposals,
changes in the recommendation of CoBiz’s board of directors or CoBiz’s shareholders not approving the merger agreement, CoBiz may be required
to pay to BOK a termination fee equal to $34.2 million. This termination fee could discourage other companies from seeking to acquire or merge
with CoBiz. For more information, see ““The Merger Agreement—Termination; Termination Fee,” beginning on page 82.

Amendment, Waiver and Extension of the Merger Agreement (page 83)

The merger agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or
after approval of the matters presented in connection with the merger by the shareholders of CoBiz, in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties, provided that after any approval of the merger agreement by the CoBiz shareholders, there may not be, without further approval of such
shareholders, any amendment of the merger agreement that requires further approval under applicable law.

Before the completion of the merger, BOK may change the method or structure of effecting the combination of BOK and CoBiz, provided, that no
such change may (1) alter or change the merger consideration or the number of shares of BOK common stock received by CoBiz’s shareholders in
exchange for each share of CoBiz common stock, (2) adversely affect the tax treatment of CoBiz’s or BOK’s shareholders, (3) adversely affect the
tax treatment of BOK or CoBiz or (4) materially impede or delay the closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in a timely
manner.

For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—Amendment, Waiver and Extension of the Merger Agreement,” beginning on page 83.

Voting Agreement (page 69)

On June 17, 2018, BOK entered into Voting Agreements with each of Steven Bangert and Noel N. Rothman. As of August 14, 2018, Mr. Bangert
and Mr. Rothman beneficially owned in the aggregate 3,124,816 shares of CoBiz common stock (representing approximately 7.4% of the
outstanding shares of CoBiz common stock). Mr. Bangert and Mr. Rothman each agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
voting agreement, to vote their respective shares of CoBiz common stock in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the approval of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, and other related matters, and to vote against any acquisition proposal. The voting
agreements will terminate on the earliest to occur of (i) the effective time of the merger, and (ii) the termination of the merger agreement. Copies of
the voting agreements are attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B-1 and Annex B-2 and are incorporated by reference herein in
their entirety. For more information, see “Voting Agreements,” beginning on page 69.

Appraisal Rights (page 95)

CoBiz is incorporated under Colorado law. Under Article 113 of the Colorado Business Corporation Act (which we refer to as the “CBCA”), CoBiz
shareholders have the right to dissent from the proposed merger and, subject to certain conditions provided for under the Colorado dissenters’
rights statutes, are entitled to receive payment of the fair value of their CoBiz common stock. CoBiz shareholders will be bound by the terms of the
merger unless they dissent by complying with all of the requirements of the Colorado dissenters’ rights statutes. For more information, see “The
Merger—Appraisal Rights,” beginning on page 95.

Differences Between Rights of BOK Stockholders and CoBiz’s Shareholders (page 88)

As a result of the merger, the holders of CoBiz common stock will become holders of BOK common stock. Following the merger, CoBiz’s
shareholders will have different rights as stockholders of BOK than as shareholders of CoBiz due to the different provisions of the governing
documents and the governing law of BOK and CoBiz. For additional information regarding the different rights as stockholders of BOK than as
shareholders of CoBiz, see “Comparison of Shareholder Rights,” beginning on page 88.

UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

The following table sets forth the basic earnings, diluted earnings, cash dividend and book value per common share data for BOK and CoBiz on a
historical basis and on a pro forma combined basis, for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2017.
The unaudited pro forma data was derived by combining the historical financial information of BOK and CoBiz using the acquisition method of
accounting for business combinations, assumes the transaction is completed as contemplated and represents a current estimate based on available
information of the combined company’s results of operations. The unaudited pro forma data and equivalent per share information gives effect to the
merger as if the transaction had been effective on the dates presented, in the case of the book value data, and as if the transactions had become
effective on January 1, 2017, in the case of the earnings per share and dividends declared data. The pro forma financial adjustments record the
assets and liabilities of CoBiz at their estimated fair values and are subject to adjustment as additional information becomes available and as
additional analysis is performed.

The unaudited pro forma data below is presented for illustrative purposes only. You should not rely on the unaudited pro forma data or equivalent
amounts presented below as they are not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have occurred if the merger
had been completed as of the dates indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial position of the combined
company. The pro forma information, although helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of the combined company under one set of
assumptions, does not reflect the benefits of expected cost savings, opportunities to earn additional revenue, the impact of merger- and integration-
related costs or other factors that may result as a consequence of the merger and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict or suggest future results.
The information in the following table is derived from and should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and
related notes of BOK and CoBiz, which are incorporated into this document by reference. For more information, see “Selected Historical Financial
Data of BOK” and “Selected Historical Financial Data of CoBiz,” beginning on pages 9 and 10, respectively.

shareholders in determining whether to adopt the merger agreement. Shareholders are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for both
BOK common stock and CoBiz common stock and to review carefully the other information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus or
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. For more information, see “Where You Can Find More Information,” beginning on
page 102.

The holders of BOK common stock receive dividends as and when declared by BOK’s board of directors out of statutory surplus or from net
profits. Following the completion of the merger, subject to approval and declaration by BOK board of directors, BOK expects to continue paying
quarterly cash dividends on a basis consistent with past practice. The current annualized rate of distribution on a share of BOK common stock is
$2.00 per share.

The merger agreement requires BOK and CoBiz to coordinate with the other for the declaration of any dividends in respect of BOK common stock
and CoBiz common stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto to ensure that CoBiz’s shareholders do not fail to receive a
dividend (or receive two dividends) in any one quarter.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE SPECIAL MEETING

The following questions and answers are intended to address briefly some commonly asked questions regarding the merger and the special
meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a shareholder. To better understand these
matters, and for a description of the legal terms governing the merger, you should carefully read this entire proxy statement/prospectus, including
the annexes, as well as the documents that have been incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Q: What is the merger?
 

A: CoBiz and BOK have entered into the merger agreement, under which CoBiz will merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the
surviving corporation. Immediately following the merger or at such time as determined by BOK, CoBiz Bank will merge with and into
BOKF, National Association, with BOKF, National Association as the surviving bank. A copy of the merger agreement is included in this
proxy/statement prospectus as Annex A.

 
Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?
 

A: In order to complete the merger, CoBiz’s shareholders must vote to approve the merger agreement. CoBiz will hold a special meeting of its
shareholders to obtain this approval. We are delivering this proxy statement/prospectus to you as both a proxy statement of CoBiz and a
prospectus of BOK. It is a proxy statement because CoBiz’s board of directors is soliciting proxies from its shareholders to vote on the
approval of the merger agreement at a special meeting of shareholders, and your proxy will be used at the special meeting or at any
adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. It is a prospectus because BOK will issue BOK common stock to CoBiz’s shareholders,
and this prospectus contains information about that common stock.

This proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the merger, the merger agreement, the special meeting of CoBiz’s
shareholders and other related matters, and you should read it carefully. The enclosed voting materials for the special meeting allow you to
vote your shares of CoBiz common stock without attending the special meeting in person. Your vote is important, and we encourage you to
submit your proxy as soon as possible.

 
Q: What am I being asked to vote on?
 

A: CoBiz’s shareholders are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
 

 •  to approve the merger proposal;
 

 •  to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation proposal; and
 

 •  to approve the adjournment proposal.

 
Q: What will I receive in the merger?
 

A: If the merger is completed, CoBiz’s shareholders will be entitled to receive 0.17 shares of BOK common stock and $5.70 cash for each
outstanding share of CoBiz common stock held immediately prior to the merger. BOK will not issue any fractional shares of BOK common
stock in the merger. Instead, a shareholder of CoBiz who otherwise would have received a fraction of a share of BOK common stock will
receive an amount in cash rounded to the nearest whole cent. This cash amount will be determined by multiplying (i) the average of the
closing-sale prices of BOK common stock for the five full trading days

ending on the trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest cent)
of BOK common stock which such shareholder of CoBiz would otherwise be entitled to receive.

 
Q: Will the value of the merger consideration change between the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and the time the merger is

completed?
 

A: Yes. Although the merger consideration is fixed, the value of the merger consideration is dependent upon the value of BOK common stock
and therefore will fluctuate with the market price of BOK common stock. Accordingly, any change in the price of BOK common stock prior
to the merger will affect the market value of the merger consideration that CoBiz’s shareholders will receive as a result of the merger.

 
Q: Does CoBiz’s board of directors recommend voting in favor of the merger agreement?
 

A: Yes. After careful consideration, CoBiz’s board of directors unanimously recommends that CoBiz’s shareholders vote “FOR” the approval of
the merger agreement.

 
Q: How will my shares be represented at the special meeting?
 

A: At the special meeting, the officers named in your proxy card will vote your shares in the manner you requested if you properly signed and
submitted your proxy. If you sign your proxy card and return it without indicating how you would like to vote your shares, your proxy will be
voted as CoBiz’s board of directors recommends, which is (1) “FOR” the merger agreement proposal, (2) “FOR” the compensation proposal
and (3) “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

 
Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders of shares of CoBiz common stock?
 

A: The obligation of BOK and CoBiz to complete the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of legal opinions from their respective counsel to
the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.

If the merger qualifies as a reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes, U.S. holders of CoBiz common stock who receive a
combination of shares of BOK common stock and cash, other than cash instead of a fractional share of BOK common stock, in exchange for
their CoBiz common stock, will recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the amount by which the sum of the fair
market value of the shares of BOK common stock and cash (other than cash received instead of a fractional share of BOK common stock)
received by such holder in exchange for its shares of CoBiz common stock exceeds the holder’s adjusted basis in its shares of CoBiz common
stock, and (y) the amount of cash (other than cash received instead of fractional shares of BOK common stock) received by such holder in
exchange for its shares of CoBiz common stock. Generally, any gain recognized upon the exchange will be capital gain, and any such capital
gain will be long-term capital gain if the holding period for such shares of CoBiz common stock is more than one year. Depending on certain
facts specific to you, gain could instead be characterized as ordinary dividend income. For more information, see “The Merger—Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger,” beginning on page 62.

 
Q: What will happen to shares of BOK common stock in the merger?
 

A: Nothing. Each share of BOK common stock outstanding will remain outstanding as a share of BOK common stock.

Table of Contents

Q: What are the conditions to completion of the merger?
 

A: The obligations of BOK and CoBiz to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions contained in
the merger agreement, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals, tax opinions and approval of the merger agreement by CoBiz’s
shareholders. For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Complete the Merger,” beginning on page 81.

 
Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?
 

A: We will complete the merger when all of the conditions to completion contained in the merger agreement are satisfied or waived, including
the receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval of the merger agreement by CoBiz’s shareholders. While we expect the merger to
be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018, because fulfillment of some of the conditions to completion of the merger is not entirely within
our control, we cannot assure you of the actual timing.

 
Q: What shareholder approvals are required to complete the merger?
 

A: The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of CoBiz common stock entitled to be cast on the proposal
at the special meeting is required to approve the merger agreement. If you fail to vote, mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy or fail to instruct
your bank, broker or other nominee with respect to the merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the merger
proposal. For BOK, no approval of its stockholders is needed, and no vote will be taken.

 
Q: When and where is the special meeting?
 

A: The special meeting of shareholders of CoBiz will be held at CoBiz’s office at 1401 Lawrence Street, Suite 1200, Denver, Colorado 80202 on
September 27, 2018 at 8:00 a.m., local time.

 
Q: Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?
 

A: All holders of CoBiz common stock who held shares at the close of business on the record date (August 14, 2018) are entitled to receive
notice of and to vote at the special meeting provided that such shares remain outstanding on the date of the special meeting.

 
Q: What constitutes a quorum for the special meeting?
 

A: Shareholders representing at least a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the special meeting must be present at the special meeting, either
in person or by proxy, for there to be a quorum at the special meeting. Abstentions will be included in determining the number of shares
present at the meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

 
Q: What is the vote required to approve each proposal?
 

A: Merger proposal:
 

 
•  Standard: Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of

CoBiz common stock entitled to be cast on the proposal.
 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you fail to vote, mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy or fail to instruct your bank, broker or

other nominee with respect to the merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.

Table of Contents

Compensation proposal:
 

 
•  Standard: Approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast at

the special meeting.
 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you fail to vote, mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy or fail to instruct your bank, broker or

other nominee with respect to the compensation proposal, you will not be deemed to have cast a vote with respect to the proposal, and it
will have no effect on the proposal.

Adjournment proposal:
 

 
•  Standard: Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast at the

special meeting.
 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you fail to vote, mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy or fail to instruct your bank, broker or

other nominee with respect to the adjournment proposal, you will not be deemed to have cast a vote with respect to the proposal, and it
will have no effect on the proposal.

 
Q: Will CoBiz be required to submit the proposal to approve the merger agreement to its shareholders even if CoBiz’s board of directors

has withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation?
 

A: Yes. Unless the merger agreement is terminated before the special meeting, CoBiz is required to submit the proposal to approve the merger
agreement to its shareholders even if CoBiz’s board of directors has withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation.

 
Q: Are there any risks that I should consider in deciding whether to vote for approval of the merger agreement?
 

A: Yes. You should read and carefully consider the risk factors set forth in the section in this proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Risk Factors,”
beginning on page 22.

 
Q: What do I need to do now?
 

A: You should carefully read and consider the information contained in or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus,
including its annexes. It contains important information about the merger, the merger agreement, BOK and CoBiz. After you have read and
considered this information, you should complete and sign your proxy card and return it in the enclosed postage-paid return envelope or
submit a proxy through the Internet or by telephone as soon as possible so that your shares of CoBiz common stock will be represented and
voted at the special meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must direct your bank,
broker or other nominee how to vote in accordance with the instructions you have received from your bank, broker or other nominee. “Street
name” shareholders who wish to vote in person at the CoBiz special meeting will need to obtain a “legal proxy” from the institution that
holds their shares.

 
Q: If my shares are held in “street name” by my bank, broker or other nominee, will my bank, broker or other nominee automatically

vote my shares for me?
 

A: No. Your bank, broker or other nominee cannot vote your shares of CoBiz common stock unless you provide instructions to your bank,
broker or other nominee on how to vote. If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must provide
the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote the shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by the bank,
broker or

other nominee. You may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to CoBiz, or by voting in person at the CoBiz
special meeting, unless you provide a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your bank, broker or other nominee. Further, brokers, banks
or other nominees who hold shares of CoBiz common stock on behalf of their customers may not give a proxy to CoBiz to vote those shares
with respect to any of the proposals without specific instructions from their customers, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have
discretionary voting power on these matters. Failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” approval of the merger agreement.

 
Q: Why is my vote important?
 

A: If you do not vote, it will be more difficult for CoBiz to obtain the necessary quorum to hold its special meeting. In addition, if you fail to
properly submit your proxy card or to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares of CoBiz common stock and you do
not attend the special meeting and vote your shares in person, your shares will not be voted. This will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” approval of the merger agreement. Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of CoBiz common stock entitled to be cast on the proposal. CoBiz’s board of directors unanimously
recommends that CoBiz’s shareholders vote “FOR” the approval of the merger agreement.

 
Q: Can I attend the special meeting and vote my shares in person?
 

A: Yes. Although CoBiz’s board of directors requests that you return the proxy card accompanying this proxy statement/prospectus, all of
CoBiz’s shareholders are invited to attend the special meeting. Shareholders of record on August 14, 2018 can vote in person at the special
meeting. If your shares are held in “street name,” you must obtain a “legal proxy,” executed in your favor, from the record holder of your
shares, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, to vote your shares in person at the special meeting. If you plan to attend the special meeting,
you must hold your shares in your own name or have a letter from the record holder of your shares confirming your ownership. In addition,
you must bring a form of personal photo identification with you in order to be admitted to the meeting. You must also bring your admission
ticket with you to be admitted to the special meeting. CoBiz reserves the right to refuse admittance to anyone without proper proof of stock
ownership or without proper photo identification. Whether or not you intend to be present at the special meeting, you are urged to sign, date
and return your proxy card or to vote via the Internet or by telephone, promptly. If you are then present and wish to vote your shares of
common stock in person, your original proxy may be revoked by voting at the special meeting.

 
Q: Can I change my vote after I have submitted my signed proxy card?
 

A: Yes. If you are a holder of record of CoBiz common stock, you may revoke your proxy at any time by taking any of the following actions
before your proxy is voted at the special meeting:

 

 
•  delivering a written notice bearing a date later than the date of your proxy card to the secretary of CoBiz, stating that you revoke your

proxy;
 

 •  signing and delivering to the secretary of CoBiz a new proxy card relating to the same shares and bearing a later date;
 

 •  casting a new vote through the Internet or by telephone at any time before the closure of the Internet and telephone voting facilities; or
 

 •  attending the special meeting and voting in person, although attendance at the special meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy.

1401 Lawrence Street, Suite 1200
Denver, Colorado 80202
Attn: Richard J. Dalton, Corporate Secretary

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should contact your record holder to change your vote.

 
Q: What happens if I sell my shares after the record date but before the special meeting?
 

A: The record date of the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the date that the merger is expected to be completed.
If you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of CoBiz common stock after the record date but before the date of the special meeting, you will
retain your right to vote at the special meeting (provided that such shares remain outstanding on the date of the special meeting), but you will
not have the right to receive the merger consideration to be received by CoBiz’s shareholders in the merger. In order to receive the merger
consideration, you must hold your shares through completion of the merger.

 
Q: What do I do if I receive more than one proxy statement/prospectus or set of voting instructions?
 

A: CoBiz’s shareholders may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement/prospectus and
multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold shares of CoBiz common stock in more than one brokerage
account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold such shares. If you hold shares
directly as a record holder and also in “street name” or otherwise through a nominee, you will receive more than one proxy
statement/prospectus and/or set of voting instructions relating to the special meeting. These should each be voted and/or returned separately
in order to ensure that all of your shares are voted.

 
Q: Are CoBiz’s shareholders entitled to seek appraisal or dissenters’ rights if they do not vote in favor of the approval of the merger

agreement?
 

A: Yes. Under the CBCA, CoBiz’s shareholders will have appraisal or dissenters’ rights in connection with the merger. For a complete
discussion of appraisal rights, see “Appraisal Rights” beginning on page 95.

 
Q: What happens if the merger is not completed?
 

A: If the merger is not completed, CoBiz’s shareholders will not receive any consideration for their shares of CoBiz common stock in
connection with the merger. Instead, CoBiz will remain an independent, public company, and CoBiz common stock will continue to be listed
and traded on NASDAQ. In addition, if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, a termination fee may be required to be
paid by CoBiz. For a complete discussion of the circumstances under which a termination fee will be required to be paid, see “The Merger
Agreement—Termination Fee,” beginning on page 82.

 
Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now?
 

A: No. After the merger is complete, you will receive separate written instructions for surrendering your shares of CoBiz common stock in
exchange for the merger consideration. In the meantime, you should retain your

 stock certificates because they are still valid. Please do not send in your stock certificates with your proxy card.

 
Q: Where can I find more information about the companies?
 

A: You can find more information about BOK and CoBiz from the various sources described under “Where You Can Find More Information,”
beginning on page 102.

 
Q: Will a proxy solicitor be used?

pay MacKenzie Partners, Inc. a fee of approximately $15,000 plus certain expenses. CoBiz has also agreed to indemnify MacKenzie
Partners, Inc. against certain losses. In addition, CoBiz’s officers and employees may request the return of proxies by telephone or in person,
but no additional compensation will be paid to them.

 
Q: Whom should I call with questions?
 

A: You may contact BOK or CoBiz at the telephone numbers listed under “Where You Can Find More Information,” beginning on page 102. In
each case, please ask to speak with the persons identified in that section. You may also contact MacKenzie Partners, Inc. toll free at 1-800-

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the general investment risks and the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus,
including the matters addressed under the caption “Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” beginning on page 29, you should carefully
consider the following risk factors in deciding whether to vote for approval of the merger agreement. You should also consider the other information in
this proxy statement/prospectus and the other documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. For more information, see
“Where You Can Find More Information,” beginning on page 102.

Risks Related to the Merger and BOK’s Business upon Completion of the Merger

Because the market price of BOK common stock will fluctuate, CoBiz’s shareholders cannot be certain of the market value of the merger
consideration they will receive.

Upon completion of the merger, each outstanding share of CoBiz common stock (except for specified shares of CoBiz common stock held by CoBiz or
BOK (which will be cancelled)) will be converted into the right to receive 0.17 shares of BOK common stock and $5.70 cash. The market value of the
BOK common stock to be issued in the merger will depend upon the market price of BOK common stock. This market price may vary from the closing
price of BOK common stock on the date the merger was announced, on the date that this proxy statement/prospectus was mailed to CoBiz’s
shareholders and on the date of the CoBiz special meeting. There will be no adjustment to the merger consideration for changes in the market price of
either shares of BOK common stock or CoBiz common stock.

The market price of BOK common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to changes in sentiment in the market regarding BOK’s
operations or business prospects, including market sentiment regarding BOK’s entry into the merger agreement. These risks may be affected by:
 

 •  operating results that vary from the expectations of BOK’s management or of securities analysts and investors;
 

 •  developments in BOK’s business or in the financial services sector generally;
 

 •  regulatory or legislative changes affecting BOK’s industry generally or its business and operations;
 

 •  operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to BOK;
 

 •  changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or rating agencies;
 

 •  announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other material events by BOK or its competitors; and
 

 
•  changes in global financial markets and economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock,

commodity, oil and gas, credit or asset valuations or volatility.

Accordingly, at the time of the CoBiz special meeting, CoBiz’s shareholders will not necessarily know or be able to calculate the value of the merger
consideration they would be entitled to receive upon completion of the merger. You should obtain current market quotations for both BOK common
stock and CoBiz common stock.

The market price of BOK common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares of BOK or CoBiz
currently.

The businesses of BOK and CoBiz differ, and accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of the shares of
BOK’s common stock after the completion of the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of
operations and market prices of common stock of each of BOK and CoBiz. For a discussion of the businesses of BOK and CoBiz and of certain

factors to consider in connection with those businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus and referred to
under “Where You Can Find More Information,” beginning on page 102.

The success of the merger and integration of BOK and CoBiz will depend on a number of uncertain factors.

The success of the merger will depend on a number of factors, including:
 

 
•  BOK’s ability to integrate the business acquired from CoBiz in the merger (which we refer to as the “acquired business”) into BOK’s current

operations;
 

 
•  BOK’s ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by its new customers in the acquired business and to successfully retain and manage

interest-earning assets (i.e., loans) acquired in the merger;
 

 
•  BOK’s ability to control the incremental non-interest expense from the acquired business in a manner that enables it to maintain a favorable

overall efficiency ratio;
 

 •  BOK’s ability to retain certain key employees; and
 

 •  BOK’s ability to earn acceptable levels of interest and non-interest income, including fee income, from the acquired business.

Integrating the acquired business will be an operation of substantial size and expense and may be affected by general market and economic conditions or
government actions affecting the financial industry generally. Integration efforts will also likely divert BOK’s management’s attention and resources. No
assurance can be given that BOK will be able to integrate the acquired business successfully. Additionally, no assurance can be given that the operation
of the acquired business will not adversely affect BOK’s existing profitability, that BOK will be able to achieve results in the future similar to those
achieved by its existing banking business or that BOK will be able to manage any growth resulting from the merger effectively.

Regulatory Approvals May Not Be Received, May Take Longer than Expected or May Impose Conditions that Are Not Presently Anticipated or
Cannot Be Met.

Before the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement can be completed, various approvals must be obtained from the bank regulatory and other
governmental authorities. In deciding whether to grant these approvals, the relevant governmental entities will consider a variety of factors, including
the regulatory standing of each of the parties, the effect of the merger on competition, and the factors described in the section of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger.” An adverse development in either party’s regulatory standing or other
factors could result in an inability to obtain one or more of the required regulatory approvals or delay receipt of required approvals. The Federal Reserve
Board has stated that if supervisory issues arise during processing of an application for approval of a merger transaction, a banking organization will be
expected to withdraw its application pending resolution of such supervisory concerns. No assurance can be given that the OCC would not also require a
similar withdrawal of an application if supervisory issues arise during processing of an application for approval of a bank merger transaction.
Accordingly, if there is an adverse development in either party’s regulatory standing, BOK or BOKF Bank may be required to withdraw its application
for approval of the proposed merger and bank merger, as applicable, and, if possible, resubmit such application after the applicable supervisory concerns
have been resolved.

The terms of the approvals that are granted may impose conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined
company’s business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. There can be no assurance that regulators
will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not have
the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, imposing additional material costs on or
materially limiting the revenues of the combined

company following the merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were consummated successfully within the
expected timeframe. Nor can there be any assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or
abandonment of the merger. Additionally, the completion of the merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders, injunctions or decrees by any
court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction that would prohibit or make illegal the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement.

BOK and CoBiz believe that the proposed transactions should not raise significant regulatory concerns and that BOK will be able to obtain all requisite
regulatory approvals in a timely manner. However, the processing time for obtaining regulatory approvals for mergers of banking institutions,
particularly for larger institutions, has increased since the financial crisis. In addition, despite the parties’ commitments to use their reasonable best
efforts to comply with conditions imposed by regulatory entities, under the terms of the merger agreement, BOK will not be required and CoBiz will not
be permitted to take actions that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on BOK and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to the merger (measured on a scale relative to CoBiz and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole). See “Regulatory Approvals Required for the
Merger” beginning on page 65.

Combining BOK and CoBiz may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the
merger may not be realized.

BOK and CoBiz have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the merger, which will
represent BOK’s largest transaction to date, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on BOK’s ability to successfully
combine and integrate the businesses of BOK and CoBiz in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt existing
customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key
employees, the disruption of either company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect
the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and
cost savings of the merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect BOK’s ability to successfully conduct its business, which could have an
adverse effect on BOK’s financial results and the value of its common stock. BOK may also encounter unexpected difficulties or costs during the
integration that could adversely affect its earnings and financial condition, perhaps materially. If BOK experiences difficulties with the integration
process and attendant systems conversion, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than
expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause BOK and/or CoBiz to lose customers or cause
customers to remove their accounts from BOK and/or CoBiz and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts between the
two companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of BOK and CoBiz
during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the merger on the combined company. In addition, the actual cost
savings of the merger could be less than anticipated.

The combined company may be unable to retain BOK and/or CoBiz personnel successfully after the merger is completed.

The success of the merger will depend in part on the combined company’s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently
employed by BOK and CoBiz. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with BOK or CoBiz, as applicable, while the merger is
pending or with the combined company after the merger is consummated. If key employees terminate their employment or if an insufficient number of
employees is retained to maintain effective operations, the combined company’s business activities may be adversely affected, and management’s
attention may be diverted from successfully integrating CoBiz to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause the combined company’s business
to suffer. In addition, BOK and CoBiz may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company or to offer
employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms.

The merger agreement limits CoBiz’s ability to pursue alternatives to the merger.

The merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for CoBiz to sell its business to a party other than BOK. These provisions include
a general prohibition on CoBiz’s solicitation of any acquisition proposal or offer for a competing transaction, the requirement that CoBiz pay a
termination fee of $34.2 million if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances and the requirement that CoBiz submit the approval of
the merger agreement to a vote of CoBiz’s shareholders even if CoBiz’s board of directors changes its recommendation in favor of the approval of the
merger agreement in a manner adverse to BOK. For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers,” “The
Merger Agreement—Shareholder Approval” and “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee,” beginning on pages 77, 75 and 82, respectively.

These provisions might discourage a third party that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of CoBiz from considering or proposing
that acquisition, even if that party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share value than the proposed merger consideration.
Furthermore, a potential competing acquiror may propose to pay a lower per share price to CoBiz’s shareholders than it might otherwise have proposed
to pay because of CoBiz’s obligation, in connection with termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances, to pay BOK a $34.2 million
termination fee.

The merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms, and the merger may not be completed.

The merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions, which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger. Those conditions include: (1) the
approval of the merger proposal by the requisite vote of CoBiz’s shareholders; (2) the receipt of all required regulatory approvals and expiration or
termination of all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof; (3) authorization for listing on NASDAQ of the shares of BOK common stock to be issued
in the merger; (4) effectiveness of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part with respect to the BOK common stock to
be issued upon the closing of the merger; (5) the absence of any order, injunction or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the merger or
making the completion of the merger illegal; (6) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each of BOK and
CoBiz; (7) performance in all material respects by each of BOK and CoBiz of its respective obligations under the merger agreement; and (8) receipt by
each of BOK and CoBiz of an opinion from its respective counsel to the effect that the merger will qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

In addition, BOK may choose to terminate the merger agreement if, prior to obtaining the approval by CoBiz’s shareholders of the merger agreement,
CoBiz’s board of directors (i) fails to recommend in this proxy statement/prospectus that CoBiz’s shareholders approval the merger agreement or makes
a material adverse recommendation change with respect thereto or (ii) breaches in any material respect certain of its obligations to call and hold the
special meeting of CoBiz’s shareholders for the purpose of voting upon the approval of the merger agreement and its obligation not to solicit other
offers. For a more complete discussion of the circumstances under which the merger agreement could be terminated, see “The Merger Agreement—
Termination of the Merger Agreement,” beginning on page 82.

Potential Litigation Against CoBiz and BOK Could Result in an Injunction Preventing the Completion of the Merger or a Judgment Resulting in
the Payment of Damages.

Shareholders of CoBiz may file lawsuits against BOK, CoBiz and/or the directors and officers of either company in connection with the merger. These
lawsuits could prevent or delay the completion of the merger and result in significant costs to CoBiz and/or BOK, including any costs associated with
the indemnification of directors and officers. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the merger is
completed may adversely affect BOK’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

CoBiz’s shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will exercise less influence over management of the
combined organization.

CoBiz’s shareholders currently have the right to vote in the election of CoBiz’s board of directors and on other matters affecting CoBiz. Upon the
completion of the merger, each of CoBiz’s shareholders that receives shares of BOK common stock will become a stockholder of BOK with a
percentage ownership of the combined organization that is much smaller than the shareholder’s percentage ownership of CoBiz. George Kaiser will
continue to own more than 50% of BOK upon completion of the merger and will maintain significant control over BOK. Based on the number of shares
outstanding on August 14, 2018 and the shares expected to be issued in the merger, it is expected that CoBiz’s former shareholders as a group will
receive shares in the merger that equal approximately 9.9% of the outstanding shares of BOK common stock immediately after the merger. Because of
this, CoBiz’s shareholders as a group will have significantly less influence on the management and policies of BOK than they now have on the
management and policies of CoBiz.

Certain of CoBiz’s directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of CoBiz’s
shareholders generally.

In considering the information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, you should be aware that some of CoBiz’s executive officers and directors
have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of CoBiz’s shareholders generally. These interests include the
vesting in full of certain outstanding CoBiz equity compensation awards, rights to continued indemnification and insurance coverage by BOK after the
merger for acts or omissions occurring before the merger and serving on the boards of BOK and BOKF, National Association. These interests and
arrangements may create potential conflicts of interest. CoBiz’s board of directors was aware of these interests and considered these interests, among
other matters, when making its decision to approve and approve the merger agreement and in recommending that CoBiz’s shareholders vote in favor of
approving the merger agreement.

For a more complete discussion of these interests, see “The Merger—Interests of CoBiz’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on
page 54.

The fairness opinion delivered by CoBiz’s financial advisor to CoBiz’s board of directors prior to the execution of the merger agreement will not
reflect changes in circumstances subsequent to the date of the fairness opinion.

BofA Merrill Lynch, CoBiz’s financial advisor in connection with the merger, delivered its fairness opinion to CoBiz’s board of directors on June 17,
2018. The opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch speaks only as of such date and does not reflect changes that may occur or may have occurred after the date of
the opinion, including changes to the operations and prospects of BOK or CoBiz, changes in general market and economic conditions or regulatory or
other factors. Any such changes may materially alter or affect the relative values of BOK and CoBiz.

The merger is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental entities that may delay the date of completion of the merger or
impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on BOK.

Before the merger and the bank merger may be completed, various approvals or consents must be obtained from governmental authorities. Satisfying the
requirements of these governmental entities may delay the date of completion of the merger. In addition, these governmental entities may include
conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of the merger. While BOK and CoBiz do not currently expect that any such
conditions or changes would result in a material adverse effect on BOK, there can be no assurance that they will not, and such conditions or changes
could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of BOK following the merger, any of
which might have a material adverse effect on BOK following the merger.

Table of Contents

CoBiz and BOK will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.

Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on CoBiz or BOK. These uncertainties may impair
CoBiz’s or BOK’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and could cause customers and others that deal with
CoBiz or BOK to seek to change existing business relationships with CoBiz or BOK. Retention of certain employees by CoBiz or BOK may be
challenging while the merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If key
employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with CoBiz or BOK, CoBiz’s
business or BOK’s business could be harmed. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, CoBiz has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course
prior to closing, and BOK is also subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to closing. For more information, see “The Merger
Agreement—Covenants and Agreements,” beginning on page 72.

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock prices, future businesses and financial results of BOK and CoBiz.

If the merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of BOK and CoBiz may be adversely affected, and BOK and CoBiz will be subject to several
risks, including the following:
 

 •  CoBiz may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay BOK a termination fee of $34.2 million under the merger agreement;
 

 
•  BOK and CoBiz will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed, such as legal,

accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;
 

 
•  under the merger agreement, BOK and CoBiz are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of their business prior to completing the

merger, which may adversely affect their ability to execute certain of their business strategies; and
 

 
•  matters relating to the merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by BOK and CoBiz management, which could

otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to BOK and CoBiz as independent companies, as the case
may be.

In addition, if the merger is not completed, BOK and/or CoBiz may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from their respective
customers and employees. For example, BOK’s and CoBiz’s businesses may be impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial
opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger. The market
price of BOK’s or CoBiz’s common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be
completed. BOK and/or CoBiz also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to proceedings commenced against
BOK or CoBiz to perform their respective obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger is not completed, BOK and CoBiz cannot assure their
stockholders and shareholders, respectively, that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially affect the business, financial
results and stock prices of BOK and/or CoBiz.

If the merger is not completed, BOK and CoBiz will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.

Each of BOK and CoBiz has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing this proxy statement/prospectus and all filing
and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the merger. If the merger is not completed, BOK and CoBiz would have to recognize these expenses
without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.

Table of Contents

The shares of BOK common stock to be received by CoBiz’s shareholders as a result of the merger will have different rights from shares of CoBiz
common stock.

Following completion of the merger, CoBiz’s shareholders will become stockholders of BOK, and their rights as stockholders will be governed by the
Oklahoma General Corporation Act (which we refer to as the “OGCA”) and BOK’s charter and bylaws. There will be important differences between
your current rights as a shareholder of CoBiz and the rights to which you will be entitled as a stockholder of BOK. For a discussion of the different
rights associated with BOK common stock and CoBiz common stock, see “Comparison of Shareholder Rights,” beginning on page 88.

Risks Relating to the Tax Consequences of the Merger

If the merger does not constitute a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, then CoBiz shareholders may be responsible
for payment of U.S. income taxes related to the consideration they receive in the merger.

The United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) may determine that the merger does not qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). In that case, each CoBiz shareholder would recognize a gain or loss equal to the
difference between the sum of any cash consideration and the fair market value of the shares of BOK common stock received by the shareholder in the
merger, and such shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of CoBiz common stock exchanged therefor.

Risks Relating to BOK Business

You should read and consider risk factors specific to BOK’s business that will also affect the combined company after the merger. These risks are
described in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” in BOK’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and in other
documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. For more information, see “Where You Can Find More Information,”
beginning on page 102.

Risks Relating to CoBiz’s Business

You should read and consider risk factors specific to CoBiz’s business that will also affect the combined company after the merger. These risks are

card that CoBiz’s board of directors is soliciting for use at the special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting.

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting

The special meeting of CoBiz’s shareholders will be held at CoBiz’s office at 1401 Lawrence Street, Suite 1200, Denver, Colorado 80202 on September

At the special meeting, CoBiz’s shareholders as of the record date will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 

 •  to approve the merger proposal;
 

 •  to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation proposal; and

Recommendation of CoBiz’s Board of Directors

CoBiz’s board of directors has unanimously approved and adopted the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and recommends
that you vote “FOR” the merger proposal, “FOR” the compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

Under the Colorado Business Corporation Act, if the merger is completed, holders of CoBiz common stock who do not vote in favor of approval of the
merger agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares, but only if they submit a written demand for such an appraisal
prior to the vote on the merger agreement and they comply with the other Colorado law procedures and requirements explained in this proxy
statement/prospectus. A copy of Article 113 of the Colorado Business Corporation Act is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C.

Record Date, Outstanding Shares, Shares Entitled to Vote and Quorum

CoBiz’s board of directors has fixed the close of business on August 14, 2018 as the record date for determining the holders of CoBiz common stock
entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the CoBiz special meeting.

As of the record date, there were 42,397,697 shares of CoBiz common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the CoBiz special meeting held by 362
holders of record. Each shareholder of record on that date is entitled to one vote for each share held on each proposal to be considered at the special
meeting.

The presence (in person or by proxy) of holders of at least a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the special meeting constitutes a quorum for
transacting business at the special meeting. All shares of CoBiz common stock present in person or represented by proxy, including abstentions and
broker non-votes, will be treated as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for all matters voted on
at the special meeting.

Table of Contents

Vote Required, Treatment of Abstentions and Failure to Vote

Merger proposal:
 

 
•  Standard: Approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of

CoBiz common stock entitled to be cast on the proposal.
 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you fail to vote, mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy or fail to instruct your bank, broker or other

nominee with respect to the merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.

Compensation proposal:
 

 
•  Standard: Approval of the compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast at the

special meeting.
 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you fail to vote, mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy or fail to instruct your bank, broker or other

nominee with respect to the compensation proposal, you will not be deemed to have cast a vote with respect to the proposal and it will have
no effect on the proposal.

Adjournment proposal:
 

 
•  Standard: Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast at the

special meeting.
 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you fail to vote, mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy or fail to instruct your bank, broker or other

nominee with respect to the adjournment proposal, you will not be deemed to have cast a vote with respect to the proposal and it will have
no effect on the proposal.

Shares Held by Officers and Directors

As of the record date, the directors and executive officers of CoBiz and their affiliates collectively owned, and were entitled to vote, 3,509,557 shares of
CoBiz common stock, representing approximately 8.3% of CoBiz’s outstanding shares on that date. CoBiz currently expects that each of its directors
and executive officers and their affiliates will vote their shares of CoBiz common stock “FOR” the approval of the merger agreement.

On June 17, 2018, BOK entered into Voting Agreements with each of Steven Bangert and Noel N. Rothman. As of August 14, 2018, Mr. Bangert and
Mr. Rothman beneficially owned in the aggregate 3,124,816 shares of CoBiz common stock (representing approximately 7.4% of the outstanding shares
of CoBiz common stock). Mr. Bangert and Mr. Rothman each agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the voting agreement, to
vote his respective shares of CoBiz common stock in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger, and other related matters, and to vote against any acquisition proposal. The voting agreement will terminate on the earliest
to occur of (i) the effective time of the merger, and (ii) the termination of the merger agreement. Copies of the voting agreements are attached to this
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B-1 and Annex B-2 and are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. For more information, see “Voting
Agreements,” beginning on page 69.

When considering CoBiz’s board of directors’ recommendation that you vote in favor of the approval of the merger agreement, you should be aware that
certain of the executive officers and directors of CoBiz have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of CoBiz’s
shareholders generally. For more information, see “The Merger—Interests of CoBiz’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” beginning on
page 54.

Voting of Proxies and Incomplete Proxies

A shareholder of CoBiz may vote by proxy or in person at the special meeting. If you hold your shares of CoBiz common stock in your name as a
shareholder of record, to submit a proxy, you as a shareholder of CoBiz, may use one of the following methods:
 

 •  By telephone: by calling the toll-free number indicated on your proxy card and following the recorded instructions.
 

 •  Through the Internet: by visiting the website indicated on your proxy card and following the instructions.
 

 •  By completing and returning the proxy card in the enclosed envelope, which requires no additional postage if mailed in the United States.

CoBiz’s board of directors requests that you vote by telephone, over the Internet or by completing and signing the accompanying proxy card and
returning it to CoBiz as soon as possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope.

All properly signed proxies received prior to the special meeting and not revoked before the vote at the special meeting will be voted at the special
meeting according to the instructions indicated on the proxies or, if no instructions are given, the shares will be voted “FOR” the merger proposal,
“FOR” the compensation proposal and “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

Your vote is important. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please take the time to vote by completing and mailing the enclosed
proxy card or by submitting a proxy through the Internet or by telephone as described on the enclosed instructions as soon as possible to make sure your
shares are represented at the special meeting. Submitting a proxy now will NOT prevent you from being able to vote in person at the special meeting.

Shares Held in Street Name and Broker Non-Votes

If your shares are held in “street name,” meaning in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee who is the record holder, you must provide the record
holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote the shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by the bank, broker or other nominee.
You may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to CoBiz or by voting in person at the CoBiz special meeting, unless you
provide a “legal proxy,” which you must obtain from your bank, broker or other nominee. Further, brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares of
CoBiz common stock on behalf of their customers may not give a proxy to CoBiz to vote those shares with respect to any of the proposals without
specific instructions from their customers, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting power on these matters.

Failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” approval of the merger agreement.

How to Revoke Your Proxy

If you are a holder of record of CoBiz common stock, you may revoke your proxy at any time by taking any of the following actions before your proxy
is voted at the special meeting:
 

 •  delivering a written notice bearing a date later than the date of your proxy card to the secretary of CoBiz, stating that you revoke your proxy;
 

 •  signing and delivering to the secretary of CoBiz a new proxy card relating to the same shares and bearing a later date;

Table of Contents

 •  casting a new vote through the Internet or by telephone at any time before the closure of the Internet and telephone voting facilities; or
 

 •  attending the special meeting and voting in person, although attendance at the special meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy.

You should send any notice of revocation or your completed new proxy card, as the case may be, to CoBiz at the following address:

CoBiz Financial Inc.
1401 Lawrence Street, Suite 1200
Denver, Colorado 80202
Attn: Richard J. Dalton, Corporate Secretary

If you choose to send a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card, the new proxy card must be received before the
beginning of the special meeting.

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must contact your record holder to change your vote.

Voting in Person

If you are a shareholder of record of CoBiz on August 14, 2018, plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot
at the special meeting. Please note, however, that if your shares are held of record by a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to vote at the special
meeting, you must obtain a “legal proxy,” executed in your favor, from the bank, broker or other nominee who is the holder of record of your shares, in
order to vote your shares in person at the special meeting.

If you plan to attend the special meeting, you must hold your shares in your own name or have a letter from the record holder of your shares confirming
your ownership. In addition, you must bring a form of personal photo identification with you in order to be admitted to the meeting. You must also bring
your admission ticket with you to be admitted to the special meeting. CoBiz reserves the right to refuse admittance to anyone without proper proof of
share ownership or without proper photo identification. Whether or not you intend to be present at the special meeting, you are urged to sign, date and
return your proxy card or to vote via the Internet or by telephone, promptly. If you are then present and wish to vote your shares in person, your original
proxy may be revoked by voting at the special meeting.

Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, CoBiz requests that you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card as soon as
possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope or submit a proxy through the Internet or by telephone as described in the instructions accompanying this
proxy statement/prospectus. This will not prevent you from voting in person at the special meeting, but will assure that your vote is counted if you are
unable to attend.

Proxy Solicitation

The enclosed proxy is solicited by and on behalf of CoBiz’s board of directors. CoBiz will pay the expenses of soliciting proxies to be voted at the
special meeting, except that CoBiz and BOK have each agreed to share equally the costs of printing and mailing this document, other than attorneys’
and accountants’ fees, which will be paid by the party incurring the expense. Following the original mailing of the proxies and other soliciting materials,
CoBiz and its agents also may solicit proxies by mail, telephone, facsimile, electronic mail or in person. No additional compensation will be paid to
directors, officers or other employees of CoBiz for making these solicitations.

CoBiz has retained a proxy solicitation firm, Mackenzie Partners, Inc., to aid it in the solicitation process. CoBiz will pay Mackenzie Partners, Inc. a fee
of approximately $15,000 plus certain expenses. CoBiz intends to reimburse persons who hold CoBiz common stock of record but not beneficially, such
as brokers, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries, for their reasonable expenses in forwarding copies of proxies and other soliciting materials to, and
requesting authority for the exercise of proxies from, the persons for whom they hold the shares.

Stock Certificates

If you are a shareholder of CoBiz, you should not send in any certificates representing CoBiz common stock. Following the completion of the merger,
you will receive separate instructions for the exchange of your certificates representing CoBiz common stock.

Delivery of Proxy Materials to Shareholders Sharing an Address

Only one proxy statement/prospectus is delivered to two or more of CoBiz’s shareholders who share an address unless CoBiz or its agent has received
contrary instructions from one or more of the shareholders. CoBiz will deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of these documents
to CoBiz’s shareholders at a shared address to which a single copy was delivered. To request that separate copies of these documents be delivered,
CoBiz’s shareholders can contact CoBiz’s proxy solicitor by mail at 1407 Broadway, 27th Floor, New York, NY 10018 or by telephone at 1-800-322-
2885. You may also contact CoBiz’s proxy solicitor if you received multiple copies of a proxy statement of CoBiz and would prefer to receive a single
copy in the future.

statement/prospectus, please contact Investor Relations at (303) 312-3412 or CoBiz’s proxy solicitor, Mackenzie Partners, Inc., at 1-800-322-2885.

THE PROPOSALS

PROPOSAL NO. 1: MERGER PROPOSAL

CoBiz is asking its shareholders to approve the merger agreement. The holders of CoBiz common stock should read this proxy statement/prospectus
carefully and in its entirety, including the annexes, for more detailed information concerning the merger agreement and the merger. A copy of the merger
agreement is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

After careful consideration, CoBiz’s board of directors, by a unanimous vote of all directors, determined that the merger, on the terms and conditions set
forth in the merger agreement, is in the best interests of CoBiz and its shareholders. For a more detailed discussion of CoBiz’s board of directors’
recommendation, see “The Merger— CoBiz’s Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of CoBiz’s Board of Directors,” beginning on page 43.

CoBiz’s board of directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the merger proposal.

PROPOSAL NO. 2: COMPENSATION PROPOSAL

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and Rule 14a-21(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (which we refer to as the “Exchange Act”),
CoBiz is seeking non-binding, advisory approval from its shareholders of the compensation of CoBiz’s named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the merger, as disclosed in “The Merger—Interests of CoBiz’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Quantification of
Potential Payments to CoBiz’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger,” beginning on page 54. The proposal gives CoBiz’s
shareholders the opportunity to express their views on the merger-related compensation of CoBiz’s named executive officers. Accordingly, CoBiz is
requesting its shareholders to approve the following resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to CoBiz’s named executive officers in connection with the merger, and the
agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in “The Merger—Interests of CoBiz’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Quantification of Potential Payments to CoBiz’s
Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger,” are hereby APPROVED on a non-binding, advisory basis.”

Approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, the vote with respect to this proposal is advisory only and will not be binding
on BOK or CoBiz and the vote on this proposal is separate and apart from the merger proposal. If the merger is completed, the merger-related
compensation may be paid to CoBiz’s named executive officers to the extent payable in accordance with the terms of the compensation agreements and
arrangements even if CoBiz’s shareholders fail to approve the advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation.

CoBiz’s board of directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the compensation proposal.

PROPOSAL NO. 3: ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL

The special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to permit, among other things, further solicitation of proxies
if necessary to obtain additional votes in favor of the merger proposal.

If, at the special meeting, the number of shares of CoBiz common stock present or represented and voting in favor of the merger proposal is insufficient
to approve such proposal, CoBiz intends to move to adjourn the special meeting in order to solicit additional proxies for the approval of the merger
agreement. In this proposal, CoBiz is asking its shareholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by CoBiz’s board of directors on a
discretionary basis to vote in favor of adjourning the special meeting to another time and place for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, including
the solicitation of proxies from CoBiz’s shareholders who have previously voted.

CoBiz’s board of directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the adjournment proposal.

THE MERGER

The following is a discussion of the merger and the material terms of the merger agreement between BOK and CoBiz. You are urged to read carefully the
merger agreement in its entirety, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference herein. This
summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. We encourage
you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety. This section is not intended to provide you with any factual information about BOK or
CoBiz. Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and in the public filings BOK and CoBiz make with the SEC. See
“Where You Can Find More Information” in the forepart of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Terms of the Merger

Transaction Structure

BOK’s board of directors has approved and CoBiz’s board of directors has approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
The merger agreement provides for the merger of CoBiz with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving corporation.
Immediately following the merger or at such later time as BOK may determine, CoBiz Bank, a Colorado state-chartered bank and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of CoBiz, will merge with and into BOKF, National Association, a national banking association and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BOK, with
BOKF continuing as the surviving entity.

Before the completion of the merger, BOK may change the method or structure of effecting the combination of BOK and CoBiz, provided, that no such
change may (1) alter or change the merger consideration or the number of shares of BOK common stock received by CoBiz’s shareholders in exchange
for each share of CoBiz common stock, (2) adversely affect the tax treatment of CoBiz’s or BOK’s shareholders, (3) adversely affect the tax treatment of
BOK or CoBiz or (4) materially impede or delay the closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in a timely manner.

Merger Consideration

If the merger is completed, each share of CoBiz common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than
dissenting shares or shares of common stock owned by CoBiz, BOK or Merger Sub), will be converted into the right to receive 0.17 shares of BOK
common stock and $5.70 in cash.

BOK will not issue any fractional shares of BOK common stock in the merger. Instead, a CoBiz shareholder who otherwise would have received a
fraction of a share of BOK common stock will receive an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying the fraction of the
BOK common stock to which the holder would otherwise be entitled by the average closing sale prices of BOK common stock on NASDAQ as reported
by the Wall Street Journal for the five full trading days ending on the trading day prior to the closing date of the merger.

Conversion of Shares; Exchange and Payment Procedures

At or prior to the closing, BOK will deposit or cause to be deposited with an exchange agent designated by BOK and reasonably acceptable to CoBiz,
for the benefit of the holders of shares of CoBiz common stock, sufficient cash and BOK common stock to be exchanged in accordance with the merger
agreement, including the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares.

The conversion of CoBiz common stock into the right to receive the merger consideration will occur automatically at the effective time of the merger.
After completion of the merger, the exchange agent will exchange any certificates representing shares of CoBiz common stock for the merger
consideration to be received pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

Letters of Transmittal

As promptly as practicable after the effective time of the merger, and in any event within 5 days thereafter, the exchange agent will mail to each holder
of record of CoBiz common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger a letter of transmittal and instructions on how to surrender shares
of CoBiz common stock in exchange for the merger consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares the holder is entitled to receive under the
merger agreement.

If a certificate for CoBiz common stock has been lost, stolen, or destroyed, the exchange agent will issue the merger consideration upon receipt of (1) an
affidavit of that fact by the claimant and (2) if required by BOK, the posting of a bond in an amount as BOK may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate.

After completion of the merger, there will be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of CoBiz of shares of CoBiz common stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time

Withholding

BOK and the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash portion of the merger consideration or any cash in lieu of fractional
shares, cash dividends or distributions payable, or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to the merger agreement to any holder of CoBiz
common stock or CoBiz equity awards the amounts they are required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign
tax law. If any such amounts are withheld and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, these amounts will be treated for all purposes of the
merger agreement as having been paid to the holder of CoBiz common stock or CoBiz equity awards from whom they were withheld.

Dividends and Distributions

No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to BOK common stock will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificates of CoBiz
common stock until the holder surrenders such certificate in accordance with the merger agreement. After the surrender of a certificate in accordance
with the merger agreement, the record holder thereof will be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest, which had
previously become payable with respect to the whole shares of BOK common stock that the shares of CoBiz common stock represented by such
certificate have been converted into the right to receive under the merger agreement.

Background of the Merger

As part of its efforts to enhance long-term value for its shareholders, the CoBiz Board of Directors has periodically reviewed and evaluated the
company’s strategic direction and business objectives. Since its founding in 1980, the CoBiz board has concluded that the best way to build long-term
shareholder value has been through continued investment in the company’s franchise as an independent company.

In early March of this year, Steven Bangert, CoBiz’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, was approached by the chief executive officer of a larger
banking organization (which we refer to as “Company A”), who indicated an interest in pursuing a business combination of CoBiz with Company A,
potentially as part of a multistep process to develop a larger presence in Colorado. Mr. Bangert indicated to Company A’s chief executive officer that
while the CoBiz Board of Directors was not currently considering any sale or similar business combination transaction, he would discuss Company A’s
interest with the CoBiz board at an upcoming board meeting.

On March 14, 2018, Company A and CoBiz entered into a confidentiality agreement.

On March 16, 2018, Company A sent Mr. Bangert a letter outlining proposed terms for a transaction in which each share of CoBiz common stock would
be exchanged for Company A common shares valued at $22.44 per CoBiz share based on Company A’s stock trading price at that time. The proposal
also contemplated that Mr. Bangert would join Company A’s board at closing and also serve as chief executive officer for Company A’s Colorado
operations.

On March 19, 2018, the CoBiz Board of Directors met. Representatives from BofA Merrill Lynch, CoBiz’s financial advisor, and Simpson Thacher &
Bartlett LLP (which we refer to as “Simpson Thacher”) and Sherman & Howard L.L.C. (which we refer to as “Sherman & Howard”), CoBiz’s legal
advisors, attended the meeting. Mr. Bangert informed the CoBiz board of his meeting with the chief executive officer of Company A and Company A’s
proposal for a business combination with CoBiz. The CoBiz board reviewed and discussed Company A’s proposal as well as CoBiz’s historical financial
performance and future prospects. The CoBiz board also discussed Company A’s proposal in the context of precedent bank merger transactions and the
operating environment and challenges faced by regional banks. A representative of BofA Merrill Lynch then provided a financial review of a potential
transaction with Company A and an overview of Company A’s past acquisitions, valuation and the evolution of its franchise. A representative of
Simpson Thacher reviewed with the board its fiduciary duties. The CoBiz board then discussed in detail possible strategic alternatives to enhance long-
term shareholder value for CoBiz’s shareholders, including a review of possible other acquirers that might be interested in a transaction with CoBiz as
well as the potential benefits and risks of remaining independent. The review of potential acquirers included a discussion of the potential acquirers’
financial capacity to engage in a transaction and execution risk, among other factors. During this discussion, it was noted that BOK might be interested
in a potential transaction with CoBiz, based on general expressions of interest over the past several years by its chief executive officer in discussing a
potential business combination (which expressions of interest did not include any price terms). The board also noted that BOK had the financial
resources and geographic overlap to be able to offer an attractive price with a stock that appeared to have significant long-term upside. Following these
discussions, the CoBiz board determined that CoBiz’s management and advisors should continue their valuation analysis of CoBiz, and also continue
exploratory discussions with Company A as well as contacting BOK to ascertain its level of interest in pursuing business combination discussions at this
time.

On March 20, 2018, executives of Company A met with Mr. Bangert and other executives of CoBiz. The executives discussed their respective
companies and operations. The executives also reviewed the strategic benefits of a combination.

On March 23, 2018, Mr. Bangert called Steven Bradshaw, the chief executive officer of BOK, to inquire about his interest in pursuing business
combination discussions. Mr. Bradshaw indicated that expanding in Colorado was a high priority for BOK and that based on their familiarity with CoBiz
and its franchise, BOK was very interested in pursuing business combination discussions. Mr. Bradshaw indicated that he would work with BOK’s
management team to provide an initial proposal within the next several weeks.

On March 26, 2018, the CoBiz Board of Directors met. Representatives from BofA Merrill Lynch, Simpson Thacher and Sherman & Howard attended
the meeting. The CoBiz board continued its discussion of Company A’s proposal, including a review of the potential strengths and risks of a potential
transaction with Company A. Mr. Bangert reported on the results of the meeting between executives of CoBiz and Company A, noting that CoBiz’s
management had concerns regarding the compatibility of the two companies’ operating models and the absence of significant synergies and cost
savings.

Representatives from BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed the results of its preliminary valuation analysis of CoBiz and provided an updated transaction
analysis of Company A’s proposal, both stand-alone and pro forma for possible Colorado expansion, and an analysis of the trading history of Company
A’s stock and business model. Following this presentation, the CoBiz board continued its discussion of other potential merger partners, including BOK
and the consideration mix BOK could propose. Additionally, the CoBiz board discussed the significant synergies and cost-savings that could potentially
be realized from a transaction with BOK, and the long-term value this could create for CoBiz’s shareholders. Following this discussion, it was the
consensus of the CoBiz board that of the

potential merger partners BOK had the best strategic fit and was the most likely to be able to provide long-term value to CoBiz’s shareholders at
relatively low risk, and that it was therefore in the best interests of CoBiz and its shareholders to pursue further business combination discussions with
BOK. Following a discussion, the CoBiz board expanded the Capital Formation Committee to four members, consisting of Ms. Rhinehart and Messrs.
Bangert, Rothman and Hutchinson, and delegated to the Committee the authority to oversee discussions with potential merger partners between
meetings of the full CoBiz board.

On April 2, 2018, BOK submitted a preliminary indication of interest. The proposal provided for a fixed exchange ratio of 0.2185x to 0.2285x (valued at
$21.63 to $22.62 per CoBiz share based on BOK’s March 29, 2018 share trading price), with the option for up to $500 million of this consideration to be
payable in cash depending upon CoBiz’s objectives. The proposal also indicated that CoBiz would potentially receive representation on BOK’s board of
directors.

On April 19, 2018, the Capital Formation Committee of the CoBiz Board of Directors met. Representatives from BofA Merrill Lynch, Simpson Thacher
and Sherman & Howard attended the meeting. Mr. Bangert and the BofA Merrill Lynch representatives provided an update to the Committee on the
value of the Company A proposal based on share trading prices of CoBiz and Company A over the past month. The Committee discussed in detail
Company A’s growth over the past years, including its significant acquisitions, and the potential risks in its loan portfolio and potential share price
volatility.    

Representatives from BofA Merrill Lynch then reviewed with the Committee the financial aspects of BOK’s preliminary indication of interest and
certain financial metrics, as well as a detailed overview of the BOK franchise. Following this presentation, the Committee discussed various strategic
benefits to a transaction with BOK compared to a transaction with Company A, including the highly aligned business models and cultures of CoBiz and
BOK. The Committee also noted that BOK had a strong record of delivering long-term value to its shareholders, with a total shareholder return that had
consistently outperformed its peer group, and noted that its growth to date had been based primarily on internal investment and organic expansion.
Following a discussion, it was the consensus of the Committee to recommend that the CoBiz board authorize management to engage in negotiations
with BOK.

On April 26, 2018, the CoBiz Board of Directors met. Representatives from BofA Merrill Lynch, Simpson Thacher and Sherman & Howard attended
the meeting. The CoBiz board discussed BOK’s and Company A’s proposals, including a review of the operations of both companies. Representatives
from BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed the discussions that had occurred with BOK to date. The BofA Merrill Lynch representatives then provided an
overview of macroeconomic issues and the implications for the banking industry in general. Following an overview of the banking landscape, the BofA
Merrill Lynch representatives reviewed its preliminary valuation analysis of CoBiz and provided an updated transaction analysis of BOK’s proposal.
After a full discussion, it was the consensus of the CoBiz board that the BOK proposal appeared to provide superior long-term value compared to
Company A’s proposal, based on the conversion ratios and consideration mix offered as well as the more compatible operating model, greater potential
synergies and cost savings, and BOK’s history of strong and consistent organic growth. The board also confirmed its earlier determination that BOK had
the best strategic fit and potential for long-term shareholder value at relatively low execution risk compared to the other potential merger partners the
board considered. Accordingly, the CoBiz board instructed senior management to continue pursuing discussions with BOK.

On April 30, 2018, CoBiz and BOK entered into a non-disclosure agreement. Shortly thereafter, CoBiz granted representatives of BOK access to a
document data room, and from that date to June 17, 2018 BOK conducted due diligence, which included in person meetings and telephonic
communications with CoBiz. During this time CoBiz also performed reverse due diligence on BOK.

On May 15, 2018, Mr. Bangert and Mr. Bradshaw spoke to discuss the status of BOK’s due diligence review of CoBiz and related matters. During this
call Mr. Bradshaw reaffirmed BOK’s strategic interest in a business

combination with CoBiz and reconfirmed his views of his originally proposed exchange ratio range. He also requested additional diligence materials to
use in refining BOK’s valuation models.

Over the next several weeks management of CoBiz and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch spoke with their counterparts at BOK and its financial
advisors to discuss various valuation and due diligence matters, and during these conversations they emphasized the importance of BOK’s final offer
being at the upper end of BOK’s initial proposal range.

On May 24, 2018, the Capital Formation Committee of the CoBiz Board of Directors held a meeting to receive an update on the discussions and due
diligence review process with BOK.

On June 1, 2018, BOK sent a letter of intent to CoBiz proposing a merger of CoBiz into a subsidiary of BOK, in which each outstanding share of CoBiz
common stock would be exchanged for 0.17 shares of BOK common stock and $5.70 in cash, representing a price range of $22.18 - $23.59 per share of
CoBiz common stock based on the closing price of BOK common stock from March 29th (the date of BOK’s initial proposal letter) through June 1st.

Later that day, the Capital Formation Committee met. Representatives from BofA Merrill Lynch, Simpson Thacher and Sherman & Howard attended the
meeting. Mr. Bangert began the meeting by providing an overview of BOK’s proposal. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch then provided a financial
review of BOK’s proposal and various financial metrics, and noted that BOK’s proposal was at the higher end of the preliminary pricing range submitted
by BOK on March 29th. After a discussion of other potential benefits and risks of a transaction with BOK, the Committee authorized senior
management of CoBiz to negotiate the letter of intent with BOK with the view of presenting it to the full board for consideration in the near future.

On June 2, 2018, CoBiz provided a draft of the merger agreement prepared by Simpson Thacher to Frederic Dorwart, Lawyers, PLLC (which we refer
to as “Frederic Dorwart”), BOK’s legal advisors. From that point through June 17, 2018, Simpson Thacher and Frederic Dorwart exchanged multiple
revised drafts of the definitive agreement and participated in discussions and negotiations with respect to the drafts.    

On June 5, 2018, the CoBiz Board of Directors met. Representatives from BofA Merrill Lynch, Simpson Thacher and Sherman & Howard attended the
meeting. Mr. Bangert reviewed the terms of BOK’s proposal. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch then provided a financial review of BOK’s
proposal and various financial metrics, including a comparison to precedent transactions. The board reviewed again the potential benefits and challenges
of remaining independent, including the need for significant additional investments in technology and management resources. After a full discussion of
other potential benefits and risks of a transaction with BOK, the CoBiz board instructed senior management to execute the letter of intent with BOK and
continue negotiations with BOK.

Over the next several weeks Mr. Bangert and Mr. Bradshaw spoke several times to discuss, among other things, strategic and operational matters, and
the managements and advisors to both companies continued discussions on due diligence and other matters.

On June 6, 2018, CoBiz provided BOK with drafts of the voting agreements to be entered into by Mr. Bangert and Mr. Rothman to Frederic Dorwart.

On June 11, 2018, the Capital Formation Committee met. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, Simpson Thacher and Sherman & Howard attended
the meeting. The Committee discussed the status of the transaction negotiations with BOK. The representative of Simpson Thacher reviewed the current
version of the merger agreement with the board. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch then provided a market update of BOK’s and CoBiz’s share
trading prices and ratios and reviewed certain financial metrics.

On June 15, 2018, the CoBiz Board of Directors met. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, Simpson Thacher and Sherman & Howard attended the
meeting. Mr. Bangert began the meeting by providing an update to the board of recent developments relating to the potential transaction with BOK. A
representative of Simpson Thacher reviewed the current version of the merger agreement with the board, including the changes that had been made from
the draft previously discussed. The representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch provided an update on the transaction negotiations with BOK. BofA Merrill
Lynch then presented materials summarizing its financial analyses of BOK’s proposal. After a review of the BofA Merrill Lynch materials and a detailed
discussion of other potential benefits and risks of a transaction with BOK, the CoBiz board determined that the proposed transaction with BOK was in
the best long-term interests of CoBiz’s shareholders and approved the merger agreement and authorized management to execute the merger agreement,
subject to final approval by the Capital Formation Committee and delivery of BofA Merrill Lynch’s fairness opinion.

From June 15th through June 17th management of CoBiz and BOK and their respective advisors negotiated the final terms of the merger agreement and
related matters.

On June 17, 2018, the Capital Formation Committee of the CoBiz Board of Directors held a meeting to consider and approve the final terms of the
proposed transaction with BOK. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, Simpson Thacher and Sherman & Howard attended the meeting. A
representative of Simpson Thacher reviewed the execution version of the definitive merger agreement with the Committee. Representatives of BofA
Merrill Lynch then delivered its written opinion to the effect that as of June 17, 2018, and subject to the conditions, limitations and qualifications stated
therein, the merger consideration provided for in the merger agreement was fair to holders of CoBiz common stock from a financial point of view. The
Committee then unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and
authorized management to execute and deliver the merger agreement. That evening the merger agreement and the ancillary agreements were executed
by the parties.

On June 18, 2018, CoBiz and BOK issued a joint press release before the opening of stock markets in New York announcing the execution of the merger
agreement.

Recommendation of the CoBiz Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger

In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and to
recommend that its shareholders approve merger agreement, the CoBiz Board of Directors evaluated the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in consultation with CoBiz management, as well as CoBiz’s financial and legal advisors, and
considered a number of factors, including the following:
 

 
•  CoBiz’s board of directors’ familiarity with and review of CoBiz’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects,

including its business plan and its potential for growth, development, productivity and profitability;
 

 
•  the review undertaken by the CoBiz Board of Directors and management, with the assistance of financial and legal advisors, with respect to

the strategic alternatives available to CoBiz, including the possibility of remaining independent;
 

 •  its review and discussions with CoBiz’s management concerning the due diligence examination of BOK;
 

 •  publicly available information regarding BOK’s regulatory status;
 

 
•  the similarities in culture and operating strategies of CoBiz and BOK, and the anticipated economies of scale for the combined company,

including investments in technology and expanded product offerings;
 

 •  the soundness of BOK’s business, financial condition, results of operation and asset quality;

Table of Contents

 
•  the anticipated pro forma financial impact of the merger on the combined company, taking into account anticipated cost-savings and other

factors, including the fact that the transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to BOK’s earnings;
 

 
•  the current and prospective environment in which CoBiz and BOK operate, including national and local economic conditions, the interest

rate environment, the competitive and regulatory environments for financial institutions generally, and the likely effect of these factors on
CoBiz both with and without the merger;

 

 
•  BOK’s record of service to its communities as exemplified by its “Outstanding” rating on its most recent Community Reinvestment Act

performance evaluation;
 

 

•  the form of merger consideration, including the cash consideration, which would ensure that a portion of the value of the merger
consideration would not be subject to potential downward fluctuations in the price of BOK common stock, and the fact that most of the
merger consideration would be in stock and with a fixed exchange ratio, which would allow CoBiz’s common shareholders to participate in
the future performance of the combined company and the benefit of any synergies achieved;

 

 
•  the fact that the implied value of the merger consideration, based on BOK’s closing stock price as of June 15, 2018, is approximately $23.02

for each share of CoBiz common stock;
 

 •  the expected tax treatment of the merger, taken together, as a “reorganization” for United States federal income tax purposes;
 

 
•  the size of the termination fee in relation to the overall transaction size, and the requirement that CoBiz submit the proposal to approve the

merger agreement to its shareholders even if the CoBiz Board of Directors has withdrawn its recommendation in favor of such proposal;
 

 
•  the opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch, dated June 17, 2018, to CoBiz’s board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and

as of the date of the opinion, to the holders of CoBiz common stock of the merger consideration to be received by such holders, as more
fully described below in the section entitled “Opinion of CoBiz’s Financial Advisor”;

 

 

•  the right to terminate the merger agreement if, subject to BOK’s right to make a compensating adjustment to the exchange ratio, the average
daily volume-weighted closing sales prices of a share of BOK common stock during the twenty consecutive trading day period ending on
the third trading day preceding the closing date is less than its pre-merger announcement price by 17.5% or more and BOK’s common stock
underperforms the NASDAQ Bank Index by 17.5%;

 

 

•  the fact that the merger agreement provides that CoBiz may take certain actions in response to an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition
proposal under specific circumstances, in the event that the CoBiz Board of Directors makes a good faith determination (in accordance with
the merger agreement and after consultation with CoBiz’s outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to take such actions
would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law;

 

 
•  the potential risks associated with successfully integrating CoBiz’s business, operations and workforce with those of BOK, including the

costs and risks of successfully integrating the two companies;
 

 
•  the potential risk of diverting management and employee attention and resources from the operation of CoBiz’s and BOK’s respective

businesses and towards the completion of the merger and the integration of the two companies;
 

 
•  that CoBiz’s directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from or in addition to those of its

shareholders generally, as described under “The Merger—Interests of CoBiz Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”;
 

 
•  the likelihood that BOK will be able to obtain requisite regulatory approvals for the transaction on a timely basis, based on CoBiz

management’s discussions with BOK; and

•  the fact that Steven Bangert, CoBiz’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will become Vice-Chairman-Colorado of BOKF National

Association, and will be appointed to each of the BOK and BOKF Board of Directors, which enhances the likelihood that the strategic
benefits that CoBiz expects to achieve as a result of the merger will be realized.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the CoBiz Board of Directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the
material factors considered by the CoBiz Board of Directors. In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the CoBiz Board of Directors did not quantify or assign any relative weights to the factors
considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The CoBiz Board of Directors considered all these factors as a
whole, including discussions with CoBiz’s management and CoBiz’s financial and legal advisors, and overall considered the factors to be favorable to,
and to support, its determination.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the CoBiz Board of Directors is forward-looking in nature. This information
should be read in light of the factors described under the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

For the reasons set forth above, the CoBiz Board of Directors determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement are in the best interests of CoBiz and its shareholders, and approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The
CoBiz Board of Directors recommends that holders of CoBiz common stock vote “FOR” the approval of the merger agreement, “FOR” the merger-
related compensation proposal and “FOR” the common shareholder adjournment proposal (if necessary or appropriate).

Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information

Neither CoBiz nor BOK makes, as a matter of course, public disclosure of forecasts or projections of its expected financial performance because of,
among other things, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the inherent uncertainty of the
underlying assumptions. However, CoBiz management provided BofA Merrill Lynch with certain nonpublic unaudited prospective financial information
for 2018–2023 prepared by CoBiz management and BOK management provided BofA Merrill Lynch with certain nonpublic unaudited prospective
financial information for 2018-2020, that was utilized by BofA Merrill Lynch for purposes of financial analyses performed in connection with its
fairness opinion, as described under “—Opinion of CoBiz’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 47. CoBiz management also provided BOK with the
same nonpublic unaudited prospective financial information for 2018 and 2019 that was prepared by CoBiz management. A summary of certain
significant elements of this prospective financial information is set forth below and is included in this proxy statement/prospectus solely because such
information was made available to BofA Merrill Lynch in connection with its fairness opinion and BOK in connection with their due diligence
investigation of CoBiz.

The prospective financial information for CoBiz and BOK reflects numerous estimates and assumptions with respect to industry performance, general
business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as matters specific to CoBiz’s and BOK’s respective
businesses, all of which are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and many of which are beyond CoBiz’s and BOK’s control. The prospective
financial information is subjective in many respects and thus is susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience
and business developments. The prospective financial information may also be affected by CoBiz’s and BOK’s ability to achieve strategic goals,
objectives and targets over the applicable periods. As such, the prospective financial information constitutes forward-looking information and is subject
to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described under “Risk Factors,” beginning on page 22, “Cautionary Statement
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” beginning on page 29, and in CoBiz’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017
and BOK’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the other reports filed by each of CoBiz and

BOK with the SEC that are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, as described under “Where You Can Find More
Information,” beginning on page 102.

The prospective financial information for CoBiz and BOK was generally not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or complying with GAAP,
the published guidelines of the SEC regarding forward-looking statements or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither CoBiz’s nor BOK’s independent registered public accounting
firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial
information included below, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and they
assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information. Furthermore, the prospective financial
information does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date it was prepared.

You are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial information set forth below. The inclusion of the prospective
financial information in this proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an indication that any of CoBiz, BOK or their respective affiliates,
advisors or representatives considered or consider the prospective financial information to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and the
prospective financial information should not be relied upon as such. None of CoBiz, BOK or their respective affiliates, advisors or representatives can
give any assurance that actual results will not differ from the prospective financial information, and none of them undertakes any obligation to update or
otherwise revise or reconcile the prospective financial information to reflect circumstances existing after the date such information was prepared or to
reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the prospective financial information are shown to
be in error or to reflect changes in general economic or industry conditions. None of CoBiz, BOK or their respective affiliates, advisors or
representatives makes any representation to any shareholder regarding the projections.

In light of the foregoing, and considering that the special meeting will be held several months after the prospective financial information was prepared,
as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasted information, CoBiz’s shareholder are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on such
information, and BOK and CoBiz urge all shareholders to review CoBiz’s and BOK’s most recent SEC filings for a description of CoBiz’s and BOK’s
reported financial results. See “Where You Can Find More Information” in the forepart of this proxy statement/prospectus beginning on page 102.

The prospective financial information summarized in this section is not being included in this proxy statement/prospectus in order to induce any CoBiz
shareholder to vote in favor of any of the proposals to be voted on at the special meeting.

Opinion of CoBiz’s Financial Advisor

CoBiz has retained BofA Merrill Lynch to act as CoBiz’s financial advisor in connection with the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch is an internationally
recognized investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other
purposes. CoBiz selected BofA Merrill Lynch to act as CoBiz’s financial advisor in connection with the merger on the basis of BofA Merrill Lynch’s
experience in transactions similar to the merger, its reputation in the investment community and its familiarity with CoBiz and its business.

On June 15, 2018, at a meeting of CoBiz’s board of directors held to evaluate the merger, BofA Merrill Lynch delivered to CoBiz’s board of directors an
oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated June 17, 2018, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based on and
subject to various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the merger consideration to be received by holders of CoBiz common stock was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The full text of BofA Merrill Lynch’s written opinion to CoBiz’s board of directors, which describes, among other things, the assumptions
made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex D to this document and is
incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The following summary of BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the full text of the opinion. BofA Merrill Lynch delivered its opinion to CoBiz’s board of directors for the benefit and use of CoBiz’s board of
directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial point of
view. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address any other aspect of the merger and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative
merits of the merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to CoBiz or in which CoBiz might engage or as to
the underlying business decision of CoBiz to proceed with or effect the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address any other aspect
of the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the proposed merger or
any other matter.

In connection with rendering its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch has, among other things:
 

 (i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to CoBiz and BOK;
 

 
(ii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of CoBiz furnished to

or discussed with BofA Merrill Lynch by the management of CoBiz, including certain financial forecasts relating to CoBiz prepared by
or at the direction of and approved by the management of CoBiz (which we refer to as “CoBiz management forecasts”);

(iii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of BOK furnished to

or discussed with BofA Merrill Lynch by the management of BOK, including certain financial forecasts relating to BOK prepared by the
management of BOK (which we refer to as “BOK management forecasts”);

 

 
(iv) reviewed certain estimates as to the amount and timing of cost savings anticipated by the management of BOK to result from the merger

(which we refer to as “cost savings”);
 

 
(v) discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of CoBiz with members of senior management of

CoBiz, and discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of BOK with members of senior
managements of CoBiz and BOK;

 

 
(vi) reviewed the potential pro forma financial impact of the merger on the future financial performance of BOK, including the potential

effect on BOK’s estimated earnings per share;
 

 
(vii) reviewed the trading histories for CoBiz common stock and BOK common stock and a comparison of such trading histories with each

other and with the trading histories of other companies BofA Merrill Lynch deemed relevant;
 

 
(viii) compared certain financial and stock market information of CoBiz and BOK with similar information of other companies BofA Merrill

Lynch deemed relevant;
 

 
(ix) compared certain financial terms of the merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions BofA Merrill

Lynch deemed relevant;
 

 
(x) reviewed the relative financial contributions of CoBiz and BOK to the future financial performance of the combined company on a pro

forma basis;
 

 (xi) reviewed a draft dated June 17, 2018, of the merger agreement; and
 

 (xii) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA Merrill Lynch deemed appropriate.

In arriving at its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the financial
and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with it and relied upon the assurances of the
managements of CoBiz and BOK that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or
misleading in any material respect. With respect to the CoBiz management forecasts, BofA Merrill Lynch was advised by CoBiz, and assumed, that they
were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of CoBiz as to the
future financial performance of CoBiz. With respect to the BOK management forecasts and cost savings, BofA Merrill Lynch was advised by BOK, and
assumed, with CoBiz’s consent, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments
of the management of BOK as to the future financial performance of BOK and other matters covered thereby. BofA Merrill Lynch relied, at the direction
of CoBiz, on the assessments of the managements of CoBiz and BOK as to BOK’s ability to achieve the cost savings and was advised by BOK, and
assumed, with the consent of CoBiz, that the cost savings will be realized in the amounts and at the times projected. BofA Merrill Lynch relied, at
CoBiz’s direction, upon the assessments of the management of CoBiz as to the potential impact of market, governmental and regulatory trends and
developments relating to or affecting CoBiz and its business. BofA Merrill Lynch did not make and was not provided with any independent evaluation
or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of CoBiz or BOK, nor did it make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of
CoBiz or BOK. BofA Merrill Lynch did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of CoBiz or BOK under any state, federal or other laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Merrill Lynch assumed, at the direction of CoBiz, that the merger would be consummated in
accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining
the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or

condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have an adverse effect on CoBiz, BOK
or the contemplated benefits of the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch also assumed, at the direction of CoBiz, that the final executed merger agreement would
not differ in any material respect from the draft merger agreement reviewed by it.

BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no opinion or view as to any terms or other aspects or implications of the merger (other than the merger consideration to
the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the merger, any related transactions or any other
agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection with or related to the merger or otherwise. BofA Merrill Lynch was not requested
to, and it did not, solicit indications of interest or proposals from third parties regarding a possible acquisition of all or any part of CoBiz or any
alternative transaction. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be
received by the holders of CoBiz common stock and no opinion or view was expressed with respect to any consideration received in connection with the
merger by the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no opinion or view was expressed with
respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or
employees of any party to the merger, or class of such persons, relative to the merger consideration or otherwise. Furthermore, no opinion or view was
expressed as to the relative merits of the merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to CoBiz or in which CoBiz
might engage or as to the underlying business decision of CoBiz to proceed with or effect the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch did not express any opinion
or view as to what the value of BOK common stock actually would be when issued or the prices at which CoBiz common stock or BOK common stock
would trade at any time, including following announcement or consummation of the merger. BofA Merrill Lynch also did not express any opinion or
view with respect to, and BofA Merrill Lynch relied, at the direction of CoBiz, upon the assessments of representatives of CoBiz regarding, legal,
regulatory, accounting, tax and similar matters relating to CoBiz or the merger, as to which matters BofA Merrill Lynch understood that CoBiz obtained
such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how
any shareholder should vote or act in connection with the merger or any other matter.

BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and circumstances as in effect on,
and the information made available to BofA Merrill Lynch as of, the date of its opinion. It should be understood that subsequent developments may
affect its opinion, and BofA Merrill Lynch does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Merrill Lynch’s
opinion was approved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA Merrill Lynch. Except as described in this summary, CoBiz imposed no other
limitations on the investigations made or procedures followed by BofA Merrill Lynch in rendering its opinion.

The discussion set forth below in the section entitled “Summary of Material Financial Analyses” represents a brief summary of the material financial
analyses presented by BofA Merrill Lynch to CoBiz’s board of directors in connection with its opinion. The financial analyses summarized below
include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill Lynch, the
tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses
performed by BofA Merrill Lynch. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the
financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill Lynch. For purposes of the financial analyses described below, the value of the merger consideration is
deemed to be $23.06 per share of CoBiz common stock, calculated as the sum of (i) the cash consideration of $5.70 per share of CoBiz common stock
and (ii) the implied value of the stock consideration of $17.36 per share of CoBiz common stock based on the closing per share price of BOK common
stock of $102.09 on June 14, 2018 and the exchange ratio of 0.17 share of BOK common stock per share of CoBiz common stock.

Summary of Material Financial Analyses.

Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information for CoBiz
and the following eleven U.S. west coast-based publicly traded banks and thrifts with assets between $3 billion and $10 billion, which excluded
companies traded over-the-counter and pending merger targets:
 

 •  LegacyTexas Financial Group, Inc.
 

 •  Opus Bank
 

 •  Southside Bancshares, Inc.
 

 •  TriCo Bancshares
 

 •  National Bank Holdings Corporation
 

 •  Westamerica Bancorporation
 

 •  Heritage Financial Corporation
 

 •  Allegiance Bancshares, Inc.
 

 •  Green Bancorp, Inc.
 

 •  Veritex Holdings, Inc.
 

 •  Heritage Commerce Corp

BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, among other things, per share equity values, based on closing stock prices on June 14, 2018, of the selected publicly
traded companies as a multiple of tangible book value per share, commonly referred to as TBVPS, as of March 31, 2018, and calendar year 2018 and
2019 estimated earnings per share, commonly referred to as EPS. The overall low to high TBVPS multiples observed for selected publicly traded
companies were 1.71x to 3.43x (with a median of 2.34x). The overall low to high calendar year 2018 estimated EPS multiples observed for selected
publicly traded companies were 13.6x to 21.5x (with a median of 17.3x). The overall low to high calendar year 2019 estimated EPS multiples observed
for selected publicly traded companies were 11.7x to 20.0x (with a median of 14.0x). BofA Merrill Lynch then applied ranges of TBVPS multiples as of
March 31, 2018 and calendar year 2018 and 2019 EPS multiples of 1.99x to 2.70x, 14.7x to 19.9x and 11.9x to 16.1x, respectively, derived from the
selected publicly traded companies to CoBiz’s estimated TBVPS as of March 31, 2018 and calendar year 2018 and 2019 estimated EPS.

BofA Merrill Lynch also reviewed core deposit premiums of the selected publicly traded companies, calculated as market capitalization less tangible
common equity, as a percentage of core deposits (representing total deposits other than time deposits of greater than $250,000, in each case as of
March 31, 2018. The overall low to high core deposit premiums observed for selected publicly traded companies were 7.5% to 33.1% (with a median of
20.6%) of core deposits. BofA Merrill Lynch then applied ranges of core deposit premiums of 17.5% to 23.7% derived from the selected publicly traded
companies to CoBiz’s core deposits as of March 31, 2018.

Estimated financial data of the selected publicly traded companies were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates, and estimated financial
data of CoBiz were based on the CoBiz management forecasts. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value
reference ranges for CoBiz, as compared to the merger consideration:
 

Implied Per Share Equity Value Reference Ranges for CoBiz   Merger Consideration
TBVPS   2018E EPS   2019E EPS   Core Deposit Premium    

$15.89 - $21.50   $19.13 - $25.88   $17.13 - $23.18   $21.09 - $25.73   $23.06

No company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to CoBiz. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely
mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and

judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the
companies to which CoBiz was compared.

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information relating to the
following seventeen selected U.S. bank merger transactions with a value of greater than $500 million announced since January 1, 2017:
 

Acquiror   Target
•  Independent Bank Group, Inc.   •  Guaranty Bancorp
•  Fifth Third Bancorp   •  MB Financial, Inc.

•  IBERIABANK Corporation   •  Sabadell United Bank, N.A.
•  Pinnacle Financial Partners, Inc.   •  BNC Bancorp
•  Columbia Banking System, Inc.   •  Pacific Continental Corporation

BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed per share transaction values, calculated as the enterprise value implied for the target company based on the consideration
payable in the selected transaction, as a multiple of the target company’s TBVPS as of March 31, 2018. The overall low to high multiples of the target
companies’ TBVPS for the selected transactions were 1.56x to 3.19x (with a median of 2.41x). BofA Merrill Lynch then applied TBVPS multiples of
2.05x to 2.77x derived from the selected transactions to CoBiz’s estimated TBVPS as of March 31, 2018. Estimated financial data of the selected
transactions were based on publicly available information. Estimated financial data of CoBiz were based on the CoBiz management forecasts. This
analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference range for CoBiz, as compared to the merger consideration:
 

Implied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range for CoBiz   Merger Consideration
$16.31 - $22.07   $23.06

No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to CoBiz or the merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the
results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies, business segments or
transactions to which CoBiz and the merger were compared.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of CoBiz to calculate the estimated present value
of the capital available for distribution that CoBiz was forecasted to generate during 2018 through 2023 based on forecasts provided by CoBiz
management. For purposes of calculating the terminal value, BofA Merrill Lynch utilized 2024 net income as approved by CoBiz management. BofA
Merrill Lynch calculated terminal values for CoBiz by applying terminal forward multiples of (i) 12.0x to 16.0x to CoBiz’s fiscal year 2024 estimated
EPS and (ii) 2.00x to 2.75x to CoBiz’s estimated TBVPS as of December 31, 2023. The capital available for distribution and terminal values were then
discounted to present

value as of December 31, 2018 using discount rates ranging from 8.6% to 10.8%, which were based on an estimate of CoBiz’s weighted average cost of
capital. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for CoBiz as compared to the merger
consideration:
 

Implied Per Share Equity Value Reference Ranges for CoBiz   Merger Consideration
EPS   TBVPS    

$20.28 - $27.83   $18.09 - $25.22   $23.06

Other Factors.

BofA Merrill Lynch also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Merrill Lynch’s material financial analyses with respect
to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things, the following:
 

 
•  historical trading prices of CoBiz common stock as a multiple of CoBiz’s future earnings and tangible book value, which indicated that such

multiples were generally higher than the average multiples for the financial institutions comprising the KBW Regional Bank Index for the
period from December 31, 2011 through June 14, 2018;

 

 
•  publicly available research analysts’ price targets for CoBiz common stock, which indicated low to high price targets for CoBiz common

stock of approximately $21.00 to $24.00 per share;
 

 
•  publicly available research analysts’ price targets for BOK common stock, which indicated low to high price targets for BOK common stock

of approximately $98.00 to $112.00 per share;
 

 
•  the relationship between movements in CoBiz common stock and BOK common stock during the eight-year period ended June 14, 2018,

including the daily ratio of the closing price of CoBiz common stock to the closing price of BOK common stock during such period, and the
average of this ratio calculated over various periods ended June 14, 2018;

 

 
•  the relative stock price performance of CoBiz common stock, BOK common stock, the median of common stock of the eleven selected

publicly traded peers companies and the KBW Regional Bank Index for the period from BOK’s offer on March 29, 2018 through June 14,
2018; and

 

 
•  the potential pro forma financial effect of the merger on (i) BOK’s estimated EPS for calendar year 2020, after giving effect to potential

strategic and operational benefits anticipated to result from the merger, (ii) BOK’s TBVPS, and (iii) BOK’s capital ratios.

Miscellaneous.

As noted above, the discussion set forth above in the sections entitled “Summary of Material Financial Analyses” is a summary of the material financial
analyses presented by BofA Merrill Lynch to CoBiz’s board of directors in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all
analyses undertaken or factors considered by BofA Merrill Lynch in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex
analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those
methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA
Merrill Lynch believes that its analyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Merrill Lynch further believes that selecting portions of
its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the
narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Merrill Lynch’s analyses and
opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater
weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.

In performing its analyses, BofA Merrill Lynch considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of CoBiz and BOK. The estimates of the

Table of Contents

future performance of CoBiz and BOK in or underlying BofA Merrill Lynch’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by BofA Merrill Lynch’s analyses. These analyses
were prepared solely as part of BofA Merrill Lynch’s analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of CoBiz common stock of
the merger consideration to be received by such holders and were provided to CoBiz’s board of directors in connection with the delivery of BofA Merrill
Lynch’s opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which
any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any
particular analysis described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Merrill Lynch’s view of the
actual values of CoBiz or BOK.

The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined through negotiations between CoBiz and BOK, rather than by any financial
advisor, and was approved by CoBiz’s board of directors. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of CoBiz’s board of directors.
As described above, BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion and analyses were only one of many factors considered by CoBiz’s board of directors in its
evaluation of the proposed merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of CoBiz’s board of directors or management with respect to
the merger or the merger consideration.

CoBiz has agreed to pay BofA Merrill Lynch for its services in connection with the merger an aggregate fee currently estimated to be approximately
$9.8 million, $1 million of which was payable upon delivery of its opinion and the remaining portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the
merger.    CoBiz also has agreed to reimburse BofA Merrill Lynch for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA Merrill Lynch’s engagement and to
indemnify BofA Merrill Lynch, any controlling person of BofA Merrill Lynch and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws.

BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities, commodities and derivatives
trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing investment, corporate and private banking, asset
and investment management, financing and financial advisory services and other commercial services and products to a wide range of companies,
governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their businesses, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates may invest on a principal basis or on
behalf of customers or manage funds that invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in
equity, debt or other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of CoBiz, BOK and certain of their
respective affiliates.

BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide investment banking, commercial
banking and other financial services to CoBiz and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including
having provided or providing certain derivatives trading services to CoBiz. From June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2018, BofA Merrill Lynch and its
affiliates derived aggregate revenues from CoBiz of less than $1 million for investment and corporate banking services.

In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide investment banking,
commercial banking and other financial services to BOK and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these
services, including (i) having acted as joint book-running manager and underwriter on a debt offering for BOK, (ii) having acted or acting as lender or
under certain leasing and other credit facilities for BOK, (iii) having provided or providing certain treasury management services and products to BOK
and (iv) having provided or providing certain derivatives trading services to BOK. From June 1, 2016 through May 31, 2018, BofA Merrill Lynch and
its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from BOK of approximately $5 million for investment and corporate banking services.

BOK’s Board of Directors’ Reasons for the Merger

BOK reasons for entering into the merger agreement include the opportunity to:
 

 •  Enhance its existing presence in the attractive Colorado and Arizona markets;
 

 
•  Catalyze revenue growth by providing CoBiz customers a more robust product offering, including treasury management, wealth

management, and private banking products and services, as well as a higher lending limit; and
 

 •  Drive material earnings accretion and improve return on capital and return on assets for shareholders.

The Executive Committee, acting with full authority of the Board of Directors, unanimously approved the merger agreement after executive
management discussed the above as well as the terms of the merger agreement, CoBiz employees and management teams, results of due diligence,
reputation of CoBiz, assets, liabilities, results of operations and risk factors. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with the
evaluation of the merger, the Executive Committee did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific
factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. The Executive Committee based its position on all the information and factors
presented to and considered by it. In addition, individual directors may have given differing weights to different factors.

This explanation of the Executive Committee’s reasoning and all other information in this section is forward-looking and therefore should be read in
conjunction with the factors discussed under the heading “Information Regarding Forward Looking Statements” beginning on page 29. The members of
the Executive Committee include the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairpersons of each of the committees of the Board
of Directors.

Management and Board of Directors of BOK After the Merger

Pursuant to the merger agreement, BOK has agreed to appoint to its and BOKF, National Association’s Boards of Directors, at or prior to the effective
time of the merger, Steven Bangert or, if Mr. Bangert is unable to be appointed, such other member of the Board of Directors of CoBiz mutually agreed
upon by CoBiz and BOK. BOK agreed to include Mr. Bangert in the slate of directors at the annual meeting of BOK’s stockholders to occur after the
effective time of the merger. Information regarding current directors of BOK and CoBiz, including biographical information, compensation and stock
ownership, can be found in each of BOK’s and CoBiz’s proxy statements for their respective 2018 annual meetings of shareholders, which are filed with
the SEC and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information” in the forepart of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

Interests of CoBiz Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

In considering the recommendation of CoBiz’s board of directors with respect to the merger, CoBiz’s shareholders should be aware that the directors and
executive officers of CoBiz have certain interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of CoBiz’s shareholders
generally. CoBiz’s board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in making its recommendation that
CoBiz’s shareholders vote to approve the merger proposal. These interests are described in further detail below.

Conversion of Shares of CoBiz Common Stock Held by Directors and Officers of CoBiz Pursuant to the Merger

As a group, the CoBiz directors and executive officers beneficially owned, as of July 31, 2018, an aggregate of approximately 3,509,557 shares of
CoBiz common stock. At the effective time of the merger, each share of CoBiz common stock held by the directors and executive officers that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will, like all other shares of CoBiz common stock, be converted into the

right to receive (i) 0.17 shares of BOK common stock, and (ii) $5.70 in cash, for each share of CoBiz common stock. Dispositions of shares of CoBiz
common stock, if any, prior to the closing of the merger will change the number of shares of BOK common stock and cash the directors and executive
officers of CoBiz will receive in respect of their shares of CoBiz common stock upon the closing of the merger.

The following table sets forth the total number of shares of CoBiz common stock beneficially owned by each CoBiz executive officer and director, as of

Conversion of CoBiz Stock Options

The CoBiz executive officers held, as of July 31, 2018, options to acquire 1,150 shares of CoBiz common stock, at a weighted average exercise price of
$12.18. The CoBiz non-employee directors held, as of July 31, 2018, options to acquire 30,183 shares of CoBiz common stock, at a weighted average
exercise price of $10.63.

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding option to acquire shares of CoBiz common stock held by executive officers and directors will vest
(to the extent unvested) and be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to a number of
shares of CoBiz common stock equal to (x) the product of (A) the number of shares of CoBiz common stock subject to such stock option multiplied by
(B) the excess, if any, of (i) the sum of the per share stock consideration and the per share cash consideration over (ii) the exercise price per share,
divided by (y) the sum of the per share stock consideration and the per share cash consideration. The “per share stock consideration” means the
exchange ratio of 0.17 times the average of the closing-sale prices of BOK common stock for the five full trading days ending on the trading day
immediately preceding the effective time of the merger. The “per share cash consideration” means $5.70 in cash. Any stock option that has an exercise
price per share that is greater than or equal to the sum of the per share stock consideration plus the per share cash consideration will be cancelled in
exchange for no consideration.

Cash-Based Retention Programs

Under the merger agreement, CoBiz may establish a cash-based retention program for its employees (including the executive officers) to promote
retention and incentivize efforts to consummate the closing, payable immediately prior to the effective time of the merger or upon an earlier qualifying
termination of employment. Allocations of amounts under the closing date retention program are to be determined by CoBiz’s chief executive officer (or
his designees), subject to the approval of BOK. If a retention award or portion thereof is forfeited by a participant prior to the closing date, CoBiz’s chief
executive officer (or his designees) may reallocate the retention award (or unpaid portion thereof) to existing employees or new hires of CoBiz, subject
to approval of BOK.

Under the merger agreement, CoBiz may also establish a cash-based retention program for its employees (including the executive officers) to promote
retention and incentivize efforts through the CoBiz Bank conversion date. Participants (which may include the executive officers) and amounts under the
conversion date retention program are to be mutually agreed between CoBiz and BOK.

Annual Bonus

Under the merger agreement, BOK is required to honor the bonus plans or arrangements in place for continuing CoBiz employees for the fiscal year in
which closing occurs. To the extent closing occurs prior to the payment of bonuses in respect of any fiscal year of CoBiz, BOK will pay the annual
bonuses to such employees in respect of such fiscal year in the ordinary course and based on actual performance through the end of the fiscal year (with
any subjective performance criteria deemed achieved at 100% of target levels), subject to continued employment through the bonus payment date;
provided that (i) if a continuing CoBiz employee is terminated without cause following the end of the fiscal year but prior to the bonus payment date, the
employee is entitled to receive the full annual bonus amount, payable on the employee’s termination date and (ii) if a CoBiz employee is terminated
immediately prior to closing or a continuing CoBiz employee is terminated prior to the end of the fiscal year in which closing occurs, the employee will
be entitled to receive the annual bonus, prorated through the employee’s termination date, which bonus will be based on actual performance through the
termination date (with any subjective performance criteria deemed achieved at 100% of target levels), payable on the termination date. All annual
bonuses payable pursuant to the above will be payable in full in cash, including with respect to any portion of the bonus that would otherwise be payable
in equity-based awards.

In addition, CoBiz may take actions during the 2018 calendar year to accelerate all or a portion of the bonus for the 2018 fiscal year to a date no later
than December 31, 2018 in order to mitigate the impact of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, subject to the approval of BOK.

Employment Agreements

CoBiz is party to employment agreements with each of its executive officers, which provide severance benefits upon a qualifying termination of
employment. All such severance benefits are subject to the executive officer’s execution of a release of all claims against CoBiz and its affiliates.

If the employment of Messrs. Bangert, Dalton, Ostertag, or Pass or Ms. Andrich were terminated by the executive for any reason or by CoBiz without
cause, in each case, within two years following a change in control of CoBiz (such as the merger), the executive officer would be entitled to the
following:
 

 

•  Basic Compensation Continuation. A cash severance payment equal to the product of (a) the executive’s annual basic compensation plus the
higher of (x) the executive’s discretionary annual bonus for the previous calendar year or (y) the average of the executive’s discretionary
bonus for the previous three calendar years multiplied by (b) the severance multiplier, in each case payable in 12 equal monthly payments.
The severance multiplier is 2.99 in the case of Mr. Bangert, 2.00 in the case of Messrs. Ostertag and Pass and Ms. Andrich, and 1.99 in the
case of Mr. Dalton.

 

 

•  Health Insurance. Reimbursement for an amount equal to monthly COBRA premiums for continued coverage under CoBiz’s health
insurance plans, less the amount the executive officer would have paid for coverage as an employee, for 12 months following the date of
termination. For other benefit plans provided to the executive officer, CoBiz will pay in cash the amount that would have been paid or
contributed to each such plan for the executive officer’s benefit had termination not occurred (excluding automobile and club dues, which
benefits end upon termination).

 

 
•  Retirement Plans. For 12 months following the date of termination, CoBiz will pay the executive officer in cash the amount that it would

have paid or contributed to each retirement plan for the executive officer’s benefit during the 12 month period following the date of
termination.

 

 
•  Excise Tax Gross-Up. If any excise tax is imposed under Section 4999 of the Code or any successor provision, CoBiz shall indemnify and

hold the executive officer harmless against all such excise taxes and any interest, penalties or costs with respect thereto.

If the employment of Messrs. Dumlao, Huss or Lindner or Ms. Hermann is terminated without cause or for good reason within six months (12 months
for Mr. Dumlao) following a change in control of CoBiz (such as the merger), the executive officer would be entitled to the following:
 

 

•  Severance Payment. A cash severance payment equal to (i) the executive officer’s base compensation for a period of 12 months plus (ii) if
the executive officer (other than Mr. Dumlao) received a bonus in respect of the last full fiscal year prior to the date of termination, an
amount equal to the average of the bonuses paid to the executive officer in respect of each year in the three-year period ending with such last
full fiscal year (or such fewer fiscal years in which the executive officer has been employed). For Mr. Dumlao, such bonus amount shall be
equal to the greater of (x) such average bonus or (y) the bonus paid to Mr. Dumlao for the last full fiscal year.

 

 

•  Health Insurance. CoBiz will pay, or reimburse the executive officer for, the portion of COBRA continuation coverage premiums for the
executive officer and his or her covered dependents that would result in the executive officer’s portion of such COBRA continuation
coverage premiums being equal to the premiums being paid by active employees of CoBiz for the same coverage for up to six months (12
months for Mr. Dumlao) following the date of termination.

For an estimate of the amounts that would become payable to CoBiz’s named executive officers under their employment agreements if each experienced
a qualifying termination of employment immediately following the effective time of the merger, see “—Quantification of Potential Payments to CoBiz’s
Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger” below. CoBiz estimates that the value of the compensation and benefits that would become
payable to its four other executive officers under their change of control employment

agreements if the effective time of the merger were July 31, 2018 and each experienced a severance-qualifying termination of employment immediately
thereafter is $1.8 million in the aggregate.

Post-Closing Roles

Under the merger agreement, at or prior to the effective time of the merger, Mr. Bangert, or if Mr. Bangert is unable to be appointed, such other person
mutually agreed upon by CoBiz and BOK, will be appointed to the board of directors of BOK and BOKF, National Association.

In addition, Mr. Bangert has been offered the role of Vice Chairman – Colorado of BOKF NA following the effective time of the merger. Mr. Bangert
has entered into an employment agreement, which is effective upon and subject to the closing of the merger, with BOKF NA, a wholly owned subsidiary
of BOK, CoBiz Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of CoBiz, and for certain limited purposes, CoBiz. Pursuant to the employment agreement,
Mr. Bangert will serve as Vice Chairman – Colorado of BOKF NA following the effective time of the merger. The employment agreement has an initial
two-year term. During Mr. Bangert’s employment and for two years thereafter, he will be subject to certain customary non-solicitation and
non-competition covenants. The employment agreement provides Mr. Bangert with an annual base salary of $50,000. Mr. Bangert will also receive a
bonus payment within 3 days following the effective time of the merger equal to the payment he would have received under his prior employment
agreement had he timely terminated such agreement within 24 months following a change in control as described above. In the event that Mr. Bangert is
terminated without cause or is constructively discharged, Mr. Bangert is entitled to severance equal to the standard severance pay for senior banking
employees at BOK plus a lump sum payment equal to his then annual salary.    Following the effective time of the merger, Mr. Bangert’s prior
employment agreement shall be terminated and of no further force or effect.

Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance

The merger agreement provides that from and after the effective time of the merger, BOK will indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, each present and former director, officer or employee of CoBiz and its subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such
capacity) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection
with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether arising before or after the effective time of the merger, arising in
whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of CoBiz or its subsidiaries, and pertaining to
matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger, and will also advance expenses to such persons to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, provided that such person provides an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form) to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. In addition, for a period of six years from the effective time,
BOK will maintain a liability insurance policy for the benefit of certain persons, including CoBiz’s directors and executive officers.

Quantification of Potential Payments to CoBiz’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger

The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information about
certain compensation for each of CoBiz’s named executive officers (as identified in accordance with SEC regulations) that is based on or otherwise
relates to the merger and assumes, among other things, that CoBiz’s named executive officers will incur a severance-qualifying termination of
employment immediately following the effective time of the merger. For additional details regarding the terms of the payments described below, see the
discussion under the caption “The Merger—Interests of CoBiz’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

(1) Cash. As described above, the cash amount payable to the named executive officers consists of the following components:
 

 

(a) For Messrs. Bangert, Dalton, Ostertag and Pass and Ms. Andrich, a cash severance amount equal to the product of (a) the named executive
officer’s annual basic compensation plus the higher of (x) the named executive officer’s discretionary annual bonus for the previous calendar
year or (y) the average of the named executive officer’s discretionary bonus for the previous three calendar years multiplied by (b) the
severance multiplier, which severance is payable under the employment agreements in 12 equal monthly payments. The severance multiplier
is 2.99 in the case of Mr. Bangert, 2.00 in the case of Mr. Ostertag, Mr. Pass and Ms. Andrich and 1.99 in the case of Mr. Dalton. If any
excise tax is imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, Messrs. Bangert, Dalton, Ostertag and Pass and Ms. Andrich are also entitled to be
indemnified and held harmless against all such excise taxes and any interest, penalties or costs with respect thereto. In addition, for
Mr. Bangert, a cash severance amount equal to the standard severance pay for senior banking employees at BOK plus a lump sum payment
of $50,000.

Except for the cash severance payments payable to Mr. Bangert under his current employment agreement, the cash severance payments are “double-
trigger” (i.e., it is contingent upon a qualifying termination of employment following the effective time of the merger). Under the employment
agreements, Messrs. Dalton, Ostertag and Pass and Ms. Andrich may terminate his or her employment within 24 months after a change in control for
any reason and be entitled to receive the cash severance payments. Under the employment agreement for Mr. Bangert effective upon and subject to the
closing of the merger (as described above), Mr. Bangert is entitled to the severance under his current employment agreement as a bonus payment within
3 days following the effective time of the merger and his severance under the new employment agreement is contingent upon a qualifying termination of
employment following the effective time of the merger.

(2) Equity. As described above, at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding CoBiz stock option will become vested (to the extent unvested)
and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration with respect to the number of shares of CoBiz common stock
based on (x) the number of shares of CoBiz common stock subject to such stock option multiplied by (y) the merger consideration less the
applicable exercise price. As of the effective time of the merger, each outstanding restricted stock award will vest (to the extent unvested) and be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive merger consideration. This table assumes a price per share of CoBiz common stock of $21.98 (the
average closing price of shares of CoBiz’s common stock on the five business days following the first public announcement of the merger). Set
forth are the values of each type of unvested CoBiz equity award held by the named executive officers that would become vested upon the
effective time of the merger. These amounts are “single-trigger” (i.e., payable automatically in connection with the effective time of the merger,
without regard to a qualifying termination of employment).

continued coverage under health insurance plans, less the amount the executive officer would have paid for coverage as an employee, for 12
months following the date of termination and (ii) payment in cash of the amount that would have been contributed by CoBiz for other benefit
plans, including retirement plans, had termination not occurred during the 12 month period following the date of termination. These amounts are
“double-trigger”.

Dividends/Distributions

From and after the date of the merger agreement, June 17, 2018, CoBiz may not, and may not permit its subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent
of BOK, make any dividend payments or distributions other than (i) regular quarterly cash dividends by CoBiz at a rate not in excess of $0.10 per share
of CoBiz common stock, and (ii) dividends paid by any of CoBiz’s subsidiaries to CoBiz or any of CoBiz’s wholly owned subsidiaries.

Table of Contents

The merger agreement provides that BOK and CoBiz must coordinate with one another with respect to the declaration of dividends in respect of BOK
common stock and CoBiz common stock, and the record dates and payment dates with respect thereto, with the intention that the holders of CoBiz
common stock should not receive two dividends, or fail to receive a dividend, in any quarter with respect to their shares of CoBiz common stock and
any BOK common stock they receive in exchange therefor in the merger.

After the effective time, no dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to BOK common stock, will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered certificate or book entry share that evidenced ownership of shares of CoBiz common stock until such holder properly surrenders such
shares. See “ —Conversion of Shares; Exchange and Payment Procedures” beginning on page 38.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of CoBiz stock who for United States federal income tax purposes is:
 

 •  a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
 

 
•  a corporation, or an entity treated as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any State or the District

of Columbia;
 

 
•  a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more

United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) such trust has a valid election in effect under
applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person; or

 

 •  an estate that is subject to United States federal income tax on its income regardless of its source.

If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) holds CoBiz stock, the tax
treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding
CoBiz stock, you should consult your tax advisor.

This discussion addresses only those CoBiz shareholders that hold their CoBiz stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal
Revenue Code, and does not address all the United States federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular CoBiz shareholders in light
of their individual circumstances or to CoBiz shareholders that are subject to special rules, such as:
 

 •  financial institutions;
 

 •  pass-through entities and investors in such entities;
 

 •  insurance companies;
 

 •  tax-exempt organizations;
 

 •  real estate investment trusts;
 

 •  regulated investment companies;
 

 •  mutual funds;
 

 •  dealers in securities;
 

 •  traders in securities that elect to use a mark to market method of accounting;
 

 •  persons who exercise dissenters’ rights;
 

 •  persons that hold CoBiz stock as part of a straddle, hedge, constructive sale or conversion transaction;

 •  United States expatriates or former citizens or residents of the United States,
 

 •  U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar,
 

 •  persons who are not U.S. holders; and
 

 
•  shareholders who acquired their shares of CoBiz stock through the exercise of an employee stock option or otherwise as compensation or

through a tax-qualified retirement plan, individual retirement accounts or other tax-deferred accounts.

In addition, the discussion does not address any alternative minimum tax or any state, local or foreign tax consequences of the merger, nor does it
address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation
Act of 2010.

The following discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations thereunder and published
rulings and decisions, all as currently in effect as of the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such
change could affect the continuing validity of this discussion.

BOK and CoBiz have structured the merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The
obligation of BOK to complete the merger is conditioned upon the receipt at closing of an opinion from Frederic Dorwart, Lawyers PLLC, counsel to
BOK, to the effect that the merger will for United States federal income tax purposes qualify as a reorganization based upon customary representations
made by BOK and CoBiz. The obligation of CoBiz to complete the merger is conditioned upon the receipt at closing of an opinion from Simpson
Thacher & Bartlett LLP, counsel to CoBiz, to the effect that the merger will for United States federal income tax purposes qualify as a reorganization
based upon customary representations made by BOK and CoBiz. Neither of these opinions is binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts.
BOK and CoBiz have not requested and do not intend to request any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service as to the United States federal income tax
consequences of the merger. Consequently, no assurance can be given that the Internal Revenue Service will not assert, or that a court would not sustain,
a position contrary to any of those set forth below.

Accordingly, each CoBiz shareholder should consult its tax advisor with respect to the particular tax consequence of the merger to such holder.

Tax Consequences of the Merger Generally to Holders of CoBiz Stock.

If the merger is treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the tax consequences for CoBiz
shareholders who receive shares of BOK common stock and cash in exchange for shares of CoBiz common stock pursuant to the merger are as follows:
 

 

•  gain (but not loss) will be recognized in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) the amount by which the sum of the fair market value of the
shares of BOK common stock (including any fractional share deemed received) and cash (other than cash received instead of a fractional
share of BOK common stock) received by a holder of CoBiz common stock exceeds such holder’s tax basis in its CoBiz common stock, and
(2) the amount of cash received by such holder of CoBiz common stock (except with respect to any cash received instead of fractional
interests in shares of BOK common stock, as discussed in the section entitled “Cash Received Instead of a Fractional Share of BOK
Common Stock” below);

 

 

•  the aggregate basis of the shares of BOK common stock received in the merger will be the same as the aggregate basis of the CoBiz
common stock for which it is exchanged, decreased by the amount of cash received in the merger (except with respect to any cash received
instead of fractional interests in shares of BOK common stock), decreased by any basis attributable to fractional interests in shares of BOK
common stock for which cash is received, and increased by the amount of any gain recognized on the

exchange (regardless of whether such gain is classified as capital gain, or as ordinary dividend income, as discussed below, but excluding
any gain or loss recognized with respect to fractional interests in shares of BOK common stock for which cash is received); and

 

 
•  the holding period of shares of BOK common stock received in exchange for shares of CoBiz common stock will include the holding period

of the CoBiz common stock for which it is exchanged.

If holders of CoBiz stock acquired different blocks of CoBiz stock at different times or at different prices, any gain will be determined separately with
respect to each block of CoBiz stock and such holders’ basis and holding period in their shares of BOK common stock will be determined by reference
to each block of CoBiz stock.

Gain that holders of CoBiz common stock recognize in connection with the merger generally will constitute capital gain and will constitute long-term
capital gain if such holders have held (or are treated as having held) their CoBiz common stock for more than one year as of the date of the merger.
Long-term capital gain of non-corporate holders of CoBiz common stock is generally taxed at preferential rates. All or part of the gain that a particular
U.S. holder of CoBiz common stock recognizes could be treated as dividend income rather than capital gain if (i) such U.S. holder is a significant
shareholder of BOK or (ii) such U.S. holder’s percentage ownership, taking into account constructive ownership rules, in BOK after the merger is not
meaningfully reduced from what its percentage ownership would have been if it had received solely shares of BOK common stock rather than a
combination of cash and shares of BOK common stock in the merger. This could happen, for example, because of ownership of additional shares of
BOK common stock by such holder, ownership of shares of BOK common stock by a person related to such holder or a share repurchase by BOK from
other holders of shares of BOK common stock. The Internal Revenue Service has indicated in rulings that any reduction in the interest of a minority
shareholder that owns a small number of shares in a publicly and widely held corporation and that exercises no control over corporate affairs would
result in capital gain as opposed to dividend treatment. Because the possibility of dividend treatment depends primarily upon each holder’s particular
circumstances, including the application of the constructive ownership rules, holders of CoBiz common stock should consult their tax advisors regarding
the application of the foregoing rules to their particular circumstances.

Cash Received Instead of a Fractional Share of BOK Common Stock.

A holder of CoBiz common stock who receives cash instead of a fractional share of BOK common stock will generally be treated as having received the
fractional share pursuant to the merger and then as having sold that fractional share of BOK common stock for cash. As a result, a holder of CoBiz
common stock will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and the basis in his or her fractional
share interest as set forth above. Except as described above, this gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or
loss if, as of the effective date of the merger, the holding period for such shares is greater than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting.

Payments of cash to a holder of CoBiz common stock may, under certain circumstances, be subject to information reporting and backup withholding,
unless the holder provides proof of an applicable exemption satisfactory to BOK and the exchange agent or furnishes its taxpayer identification number,
and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Any amounts withheld from payments to a holder under the
backup withholding rules are not additional tax and will be allowed as a refund or credit against the holder’s United States federal income tax liability,
provided the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

A holder of CoBiz stock who receives BOK stock as a result of the merger will be required to retain records pertaining to the merger. Each holder of
CoBiz stock who is required to file a United States federal income tax return and who is a “significant holder” that receives BOK stock in the merger
will be required to file a statement

with such United States federal income tax return in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3 setting forth such holder’s basis (determined
immediately prior to the exchange) in the CoBiz stock surrendered and the fair market value (determined immediately prior to the exchange) of the
CoBiz stock that is exchanged by such significant holder. A “significant holder” is a holder of CoBiz stock who, immediately before the merger, owned
at least 5% of the outstanding stock of CoBiz or securities of CoBiz with a basis for federal income taxes of at least $1.0 million.

The preceding discussion is intended only as a summary of material United States federal income tax consequences of the merger and does not
address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances. Moreover, it does not address any non-income tax or
any foreign, state or local tax consequences of the merger. Thus, you are strongly encouraged to consult your tax advisor as to the specific tax
consequences resulting from the merger, including tax return reporting requirements, the applicability and effect of United States federal, state,
local, and other tax laws and the effect of any proposed changes in the tax laws.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

Before BOK and BOKF Bank may complete the merger and the bank merger, they must obtain regulatory approval from federal banking regulators, as
summarized below. BOK and Cobiz have agreed to use, and cause their applicable subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain the regulatory
approvals necessary or advisable to complete the merger and bank merger.

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

Completion of the merger is subject, among other things, to approval by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to Section 3 of the BHC Act. In
considering the approval of an application under Section 3 of the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board reviews certain factors, including: (1) the
competitive impact of the transaction, (2) the financial and managerial resources of the bank holding companies and banks involved and the future
prospects of the combined organization (including consideration of the current and projected capital positions and levels of indebtedness), (3) the
convenience and needs of the communities to be served, (4) the effectiveness of the companies in combatting money laundering, and (5) the extent to
which the proposal would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system.

The Federal Reserve Board also reviews the records of performance of the relevant insured depository institutions under the Community Reinvestment
Act of 1977 (which we refer to as the “CRA”). In addition, in connection with an interstate merger transaction, the Federal Reserve Board considers
certain additional factors under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (which we refer to as the Riegle-Neal Act),
including the capital position of the acquiring bank holding company, state laws regarding the minimum age of the bank to be acquired, the
concentration of deposits on a nationwide and statewide basis, and compliance with any applicable state community reinvestment and antitrust laws.

Furthermore, the BHC Act and Federal Reserve Board regulations require published notice of, and the opportunity for public comment on, the
application to the Federal Reserve Board, and authorize the Federal Reserve Board to hold a public hearing or meeting if the Federal Reserve Board
determines that a hearing or meeting would be appropriate. The Federal Reserve Board takes into account the views of third party commenters,
particularly on the subject of the merging parties’ CRA performance and record of service to their communities. As part of the review process in merger
transactions, the Federal Reserve Board frequently receives protests from community groups and others. Any hearing, meeting or comments provided by
third parties could prolong the period during which the application is under review by the Federal Reserve Board.

Table of Contents

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

In order to consummate the merger of CoBiz Bank with and into BOKF Bank, BOKF Bank must receive the approval of the OCC under Section 18(c)
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “Bank Merger Act”). In considering the approval of an application under the Bank Merger Act, the OCC
reviews certain factors, including: (1) the competitive impact of the transaction, (2) the financial and managerial resources of the depository institutions
party to the bank merger and future prospects of the resulting institution, (3) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, (4) the
depository institutions’ effectiveness in combating money-laundering activities and (5) the risk to the stability of the United States banking and financial
system.

The OCC also reviews the records of performance of the relevant insured depository institutions under the CRA. In addition, in connection with an
interstate bank merger transaction, the OCC considers certain additional factors under the Riegle-Neal Act, state laws regarding the minimum age of the
bank to be acquired, the concentration of deposits on a nationwide and statewide basis, and compliance with any applicable state community
reinvestment and antitrust laws. Under the Riegle-Neal Act, the OCC may approve an interstate merger transaction only if each constituent bank is
adequately capitalized at the time the application for such transaction is filed with the OCC, and the OCC determines that the resulting bank will be well
capitalized and well managed upon the closing of the transaction.

Furthermore, the Bank Merger Act and OCC regulations require published notice of, and the opportunity for public comment on, the application to the
OCC, and authorize the OCC to hold a public hearing or meeting if the OCC determines that a hearing or meeting would be appropriate. The OCC takes
into account the views of third party commenters, particularly on the subject of the merging parties’ CRA performance and record of service to their
communities. As part of the review process in merger transactions, the OCC frequently receives protests from community groups and others. Any
hearing, meeting or comments provided by third parties could prolong the period during which the application is under review by the OCC.

Department of Justice

In addition to the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC, the Department of Justice (which we refer to as the “DOJ”) conducts a concurrent competitive
review of the merger to analyze the merger’s competitive effects and determine whether the merger would result in a violation of the antitrust laws.
Transactions approved under Section 3 of the BHC Act or the Bank Merger Act generally may not be completed until 30 days after the approval of the
applicable federal banking agency is received, during which time the DOJ may challenge the transaction on antitrust grounds. With the approval of the
applicable federal banking agency and the concurrence of the DOJ, the waiting period may be reduced to no less than 15 days. The commencement of
an antitrust action would stay the effectiveness of such an approval unless a court specifically ordered otherwise. In reviewing the merger, the DOJ could
analyze the merger’s effect on competition differently than the Federal Reserve Board or the OCC, and thus it is possible that the DOJ could reach a
different conclusion than the Federal Reserve Board or the OCC regarding the merger’s effects on competition. A determination by the DOJ not to
object to the merger may not prevent the filing of antitrust actions by private persons or state attorneys general.

BOK and CoBiz believe that the merger and bank merger should not raise substantial antitrust or other significant regulatory concerns and that BOK
will be able to obtain all requisite regulatory approvals in a timely manner. However, there can be no assurance that all of the regulatory approvals
described above will be obtained and, if obtained, as to the timing of any such approvals. In addition, there can be no assurance that such approvals will
not impose conditions or requirements that would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on BOK and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
after giving effect to the merger. There can likewise be no assurances that U.S. federal or state regulatory authorities will not attempt to challenge the
merger on antitrust grounds or for other reasons, or if such a challenge is made, as to the result of such challenge.

RESALE OF BOK COMMON SHARES

All shares of BOK common stock received by CoBiz shareholders in the merger, will be freely tradable for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (which we refer to as the “Securities Act”) and the Exchange Act, except for shares of BOK common stock received by any CoBiz shareholder
who becomes an “affiliate” of BOK after completion of the merger. This proxy statement/prospectus does not cover resales of shares of BOK common
stock received by any person upon completion of the merger, as applicable, and no person is authorized to make any use of this proxy
statement/prospectus in connection with any resale. At or promptly following the closing of the merger, BOK expects to take the necessary steps to
delist the CoBiz common stock from NASDAQ and terminate CoBiz’s registration and reporting obligations with the SEC, so that CoBiz common stock
will no longer trade on NASDAQ or any other securities exchange and CoBiz will no longer file reports or other public disclosure with the SEC under
the Exchange Act.

VOTING AGREEMENTS

The description in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the voting
agreements, copies of which are attached as Annexes B-1 and B-2 to this proxy statement/prospectus and are incorporated by reference herein in its

You are encouraged to read the voting agreements carefully and in their entirety.

In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, and as a condition to BOK’s willingness to enter into the merger agreement, each of Steven
Bangert and Noel N. Rothman entered into voting agreements with BOK. As of July 31, 2018, Mr. Bangert and Mr. Rothman beneficially owned in the
aggregate 3,124,816 shares of CoBiz common stock (representing approximately 7.4% of the outstanding shares of CoBiz common stock). The
foregoing shares are referred to as the existing shares, and together with any shares of CoBiz common stock or other capital stock of CoBiz of which
Mr. Bangert or Mr. Rothman acquires beneficial ownership on or after the date thereof, are referred to as the subject shares.

Voting

At the CoBiz special meeting and any other meeting or in any written consent of CoBiz shareholders called in relation to any of the following matters,
Mr. Bangert and Mr. Rothman has each agreed to be appear at such meeting or otherwise cause all of their respective subject shares to be counted as
present and vote or cause to be voted all of their shares as follows:
 

 (A) in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby;
 

 
(B) in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone the CoBiz meeting to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger

agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;
 

 (C) against any acquisition proposal (as hereinafter defined); and
 

 
(D) against any other action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impair or materially delay the closing of the

merger.

Prohibition on Transfers

Until the termination of the voting agreement, Mr. Bangert and Mr. Rothman will each not, directly or indirectly:
 

 
•  sell (including short sales), transfer, give, pledge, grant a security interest in, encumber, assign, grant any option for the sale of, enter into a

“put equivalent position” (as defined in Rule 16a-1(h) under the exchange act) or otherwise transfer or dispose of (including by operation of
law) any of the subject shares (which we refer to collectively as a “transfer”); or

 

 
•  enter into any agreement, arrangement or undertaking with respect to any transfer of the subject shares, other than to an affiliate who agrees

in writing to comply with all the provisions of the voting agreement.

Under the terms of the voting agreement, any transfer of the subject shares without BOK’s consent is void.

Termination

The voting agreement will terminate automatically upon the earlier of the effective time of the merger and the termination of the merger agreement.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

This section describes the material terms of the merger agreement. The description in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the
merger agreement that is important to you. You are encouraged to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety. This section is not intended to
provide you with any factual information about BOK or CoBiz. Such information can be found elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and in the
public filings BOK and CoBiz make with the SEC, as described in the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” in the forepart of this
proxy statement/prospectus.

Effects of the Merger; Merger Consideration

BOK’s board of directors has approved and CoBiz’s board of directors has approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby.
The merger agreement provides for the merger of CoBiz with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving corporation.
Immediately following the merger or at such later time as BOK may determine, CoBiz Bank, a Colorado state-chartered bank and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of CoBiz, will merge with and into BOKF, National Association, a national banking association and a wholly-owned subsidiary of BOK, with
BOKF continuing as the surviving entity.

Before the completion of the merger, BOK may change the method or structure of effecting the combination of BOK and CoBiz, provided, that no such
change may (1) alter or change the merger consideration or the number of shares of BOK common stock received by CoBiz’s shareholders in exchange
for each share of CoBiz common stock, (2) adversely affect the tax treatment of CoBiz’s or BOK’s shareholders, (3) adversely affect the tax treatment of
BOK or CoBiz or (4) materially impede or delay the closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in a timely manner.

If the merger is completed, each share of CoBiz common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than
dissenting shares or shares of common stock owned by CoBiz, BOK or Merger Sub), will be converted into the right to receive 0.17 shares of BOK
common stock and $5.70 in cash.

BOK will not issue any fractional shares of BOK common stock in the merger. Instead, a CoBiz shareholder who otherwise would have received a
fraction of a share of BOK common stock will receive an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying the fraction of the
BOK common stock to which the holder would otherwise be entitled by the average closing sale prices of BOK common stock on NASDAQ as reported
by the Wall Street Journal for the five full trading days ending on the trading day prior to the closing date of the merger.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

Unless the parties otherwise mutually agree, the closing of the merger will occur no later than three business days after the satisfaction or waiver of all
the closing conditions, including the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, shareholder approval and after the expiration of all regulatory waiting
periods. See “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger” beginning on page 81 for a more complete description of the conditions that must be
satisfied prior to closing.

On the closing date, the surviving corporation will effect the merger legally by filing a statement of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Colorado and a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Oklahoma. The merger will become effective at such time as is specified
in such statement of merger and certificate of merger. The time at which the merger becomes effective is sometimes referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus as the “effective time.”

Table of Contents

As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the parties expect that the merger will be effective in the fourth quarter of 2018. However, there can be
no assurance as to when or if the merger will occur.

If the merger has not been consummated on or before June 17, 2019, the merger agreement may be terminated by either BOK or CoBiz, unless the
failure of the closing to occur by such date is due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform or observe the
covenants and agreements of such party set forth in the merger agreement. See the section below entitled “The Merger Agreement—Termination;
Termination Fee” beginning on page 82.

Conversion of Shares and Exchange of Certificates

The conversion of CoBiz common stock into the right to receive the merger consideration will occur automatically at the effective time of the merger.
After completion of the merger, the exchange agent will exchange any certificates representing shares of CoBiz common stock for the merger
consideration to be received pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement.

Letter of Transmittal

As promptly as practicable after the effective time of the merger, and in any event within 5 days thereafter, the exchange agent will mail to each holder
of record of CoBiz common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger a letter of transmittal and instructions on how to surrender shares
of CoBiz common stock in exchange for the merger consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares the holder is entitled to receive under the
merger agreement.

If a certificate for CoBiz common stock has been lost, stolen, or destroyed, the exchange agent will issue the merger consideration upon receipt of (1) an
affidavit of that fact by the claimant and (2) if required by BOK, the posting of a bond in an amount as BOK may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate.

After completion of the merger, there will be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of CoBiz of shares of CoBiz common stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time.

Withholding

BOK and the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash portion of the merger consideration or any cash in lieu of fractional
shares, cash dividends or distributions payable, or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to the merger agreement to any holder of CoBiz
common stock or CoBiz equity awards the amounts they are required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign
tax law. If any such amounts are withheld and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, these amounts will be treated for all purposes of the
merger agreement as having been paid to the holder of CoBiz common stock or CoBiz equity awards from whom they were withheld.

Dividends and Distributions

No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to BOK common stock will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificates of CoBiz
common stock until the holder surrenders such certificate in accordance with the merger agreement. After the surrender of a certificate in accordance
with the merger agreement, the record holder thereof will be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest, which had
previously become payable with respect to the whole shares of BOK common stock that the shares of CoBiz common stock represented by such
certificate have been converted into the right to receive under the merger agreement.

Treatment of CoBiz Stock Options and Other Equity Awards

Stock Options. At the effective time of the merger, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, each option granted by CoBiz to
purchase shares of CoBiz common stock under the company stock plan, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the effective time, shall fully vest and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the merger consideration, less
applicable withholding, with respect to a number of shares of CoBiz common stock equal to (x) the product of (A) the number of shares of CoBiz
common stock subject to such stock option multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of (i) the sum of the per share stock consideration and the per share cash
consideration over (ii) the exercise price per share, divided by (y) the sum of the per share stock consideration and the per share cash consideration. The
“per share stock consideration” means the exchange ratio of 0.17 times the average of the closing-sale prices of BOK common stock for the five full
trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the effective time of the merger. The “per share cash consideration” means $5.70 in cash.
Any stock option that has an exercise price per share that is greater than or equal to the sum of the per share stock consideration plus the per share cash
consideration will be cancelled in exchange for no consideration.

Restricted Stock Awards. At the effective time of the merger, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, each CoBiz restricted stock
award that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time shall fully vest and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to
receive merger consideration, less applicable withholding, with respect to the number of shares of CoBiz common stock subject to such restricted stock
award.

Covenants and Agreements

Conduct of Businesses Prior to the Completion of the Merger. CoBiz has agreed that, prior to the effective time of the merger, except as required by law,
as consented to by BOK or as contemplated or permitted by the merger agreement, CoBiz will conduct its businesses, and cause its subsidiaries to
conduct their respective businesses, in the ordinary course in all material respects and use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain and preserve
intact its business organization, the services of its employees and its advantageous business relationships. CoBiz and BOK have each agreed not to, and
cause their respective subsidiaries not to, knowingly take any action that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect or materially delay the ability
of CoBiz, BOK or their respective subsidiaries to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals required for the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement or perform their respective covenants and agreements under the merger agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement.

In addition to the general covenants above, CoBiz has agreed that prior to the effective time of the merger, subject to specified exceptions, it will not,
and will not permit its subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent of BOK (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed):
 

 

•  other than in the ordinary course of business, incur any indebtedness for borrowed money (other than (x) indebtedness of CoBiz or any of its
wholly-owned subsidiaries to CoBiz or any of its subsidiaries or (y) Federal Home Loan Bank advances, deposits, purchases of federal
funds and entering into repurchase agreements), assume, guarantee, endorse or otherwise as an accommodation become responsible for the
obligations of any other person (other than (x) a subsidiary of CoBiz, (y) in connection with the presentation of items for collection and
(z) letters of credit and similar instruments);

 

 

•  (i) adjust, split, combine or reclassify any capital stock; (ii) make, declare or pay any dividend, or make any other distribution on, or directly
or indirectly redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, any shares of its capital stock or any securities or obligations convertible (whether
currently convertible or convertible only after the passage of time or the occurrence of certain events) into or exchangeable for any shares of
its capital stock (except (A) regular quarterly cash dividends by CoBiz on the CoBiz common stock at a rate not in excess of $0.10 per share
of CoBiz common stock, (B) dividends paid by

any of CoBiz’s subsidiaries to CoBiz or any of CoBiz’s wholly-owned subsidiaries, (C) the acceptance of shares of CoBiz common stock as

options or the vesting or settlement of CoBiz equity awards or (D) to satisfy obligations under CoBiz benefit plans; (iii) grant any stock
options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, restricted stock unit awards, restricted shares or other equity-based awards or
interests; or (iv) issue, sell or otherwise permit to become outstanding any additional shares of capital stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into, or exercisable for, any shares of its capital stock or any options, warrants, or other rights of any kind to acquire any
shares of capital stock, except for employee, consultant and non-employee director equity awards in the ordinary course of business
pursuant to the exercise of CoBiz stock options or the vesting or settlement of CoBiz equity awards;

foregoing actions.

Regulatory Matters. BOK and CoBiz have agreed to promptly prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy
statement/prospectus is a part. BOK and CoBiz have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities
Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the S-4 effective for so long as necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, and CoBiz will thereafter mail or deliver the proxy statement/prospectus to CoBiz’s shareholders. BOK has also agreed to use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or “Blue Sky” permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, and CoBiz has agreed to furnish all information concerning CoBiz and the holders of CoBiz common stock as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. In addition, BOK and CoBiz have agreed to file no later than 20 business days
following the date of the merger agreement, all applications and notices with governmental entities to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals.

BOK and CoBiz have agreed to cooperate with each other and use, and cause their respective subsidiaries to use, their respective reasonable best efforts
to promptly prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and governmental entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Additionally, each of BOK and CoBiz has agreed to furnish, upon request, to the other all information concerning itself, its subsidiaries, directors,
officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with this proxy statement/prospectus, the
Form S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of BOK, CoBiz or any of their respective subsidiaries to any
governmental entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

BOK and CoBiz have each agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order that would restrain, prevent or delay the closing of the merger and (ii) avoid or eliminate all impediments under
applicable law so as to enable the closing of the merger to occur as soon as possible, provided that BOK will not be required and CoBiz will not be
permitted to take, or agree to take, any actions or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with the grant of certain required regulatory
approvals, that would reasonably be expected to result in a materially burdensome regulatory condition.

Shareholder Approval. CoBiz’s Board of Directors has resolved to recommend to the CoBiz common shareholders that they approve the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. CoBiz’s Board of Directors has resolved to convene and hold a meeting of the CoBiz common
shareholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective and to submit the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby to the CoBiz common shareholders and any other matters required to be approved by the CoBiz common shareholders in order to
carry out the intentions of the merger agreement. However, if CoBiz’s Board of Directors, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under Colorado law to continue to
recommend these matters to CoBiz shareholders, then CoBiz’s Board of Directors may submit the merger agreement to its common shareholders
without recommendation or may change its recommendation, provided that CoBiz’s Board of Directors may not withdraw or change its recommendation
unless (i) it gives BOK at least five business days’ prior written notice of its intention to do so and a reasonable

description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such action and (ii) at the end of such notice period, CoBiz’s Board of
Directors takes into account any amendment or modification to the merger agreement proposed by BOK and, after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel and financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
Colorado law to continue to recommend such matters to CoBiz’s shareholders.

NASDAQ Listing. BOK will cause the BOK common stock to be issued in connection with the merger to be approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject
to official notice of issuance, prior to the effective time of the merger.

Employee Matters.

Through the first anniversary of the closing date of the merger, BOK has agreed to provide the CoBiz continuing employees (during any period of
employment prior to the first anniversary of the closing date) with (i) a base salary or base wage rate that is no less favorable than that provided by
CoBiz to the continuing employee immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, unless the continuing employee chooses to accept a position
with BOK that is not substantially similar to the job function for which such continuing employee was employed by CoBiz prior to the closing,
(ii) short- and long-term incentive compensation opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than such opportunities provided to similarly
situated employees of BOK, and (iii) other compensation and employee benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the other compensation
and employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of BOK.

BOK further agreed to provide each CoBiz continuing employee whose employment terminates during the period between the closing date of the merger
and December 31 of the year following the year in which the closing date occurs with severance benefits equal to the greater of (A) the severance
benefits for which such continuing employee was eligible immediately prior to the closing and (B) the severance benefits for which similarly situated
employees of BOK would be eligible under the severance plans or policies of BOK, in each case, determined without taking into account any reduction
after the closing of the merger in compensation paid to such continuing employee.

BOK also will assume and honor all CoBiz benefit plans in accordance with their terms. Under the merger agreement, BOK has acknowledged that a
change in control (or similar phrase) within the meaning of CoBiz’s benefit plans will occur as of the effective time of the merger. If requested by BOK
prior to the closing date of the merger, CoBiz will adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate CoBiz’s 401(k) plan,
effective as of the closing date.

CoBiz may establish a cash-based retention program to promote retention and to incentivize efforts to consummate the closing, with such payments to
be paid immediately prior to the effective time of the merger or upon an earlier qualifying termination of employment. Allocations of amounts under the
closing date retention program will be determined by CoBiz’s chief executive officer (or his designees), subject to approval of BOK. If a retention award
or portion thereof is forfeited prior to the closing date, CoBiz’s chief executive officer (or his designees) may reallocate the retention award (or any
unpaid portion thereof) to existing employees or new hires of CoBiz, subject to approval of BOK. CoBiz may also establish a cash-based retention
program to promote retention and incentive efforts through the CoBiz Bank conversion date, with participants and amounts to be mutually agreed
between CoBiz and BOK.

BOK has agreed to honor the bonus plans or arrangements in place for CoBiz continuing employees for the fiscal year in which closing occurs. To the
extent closing occurs prior to the payment of bonuses in respect of any fiscal year of CoBiz, BOK will pay the annual bonuses to such employees in
respect of such fiscal year in the ordinary course and based on actual performance through the end of the fiscal year (with any subjective performance
criteria deemed achieved at 100% of target levels), subject to continued employment through the bonus payment date; provided that (i) if a CoBiz
continuing employee is terminated without cause following the end of the fiscal year but prior to the bonus payment date, the employee is entitled to
receive the full annual bonus amount,

Table of Contents

payable on the employee’s termination date and (ii) if a CoBiz employee is terminated immediately prior to closing or a CoBiz continuing employee is
terminated prior to the end of the fiscal year in which closing occurs, the employee will be entitled to receive the annual bonus, prorated through the
employee’s termination date, which bonus will be based on actual performance through the termination date (with any subjective performance criteria
deemed achieved at 100% of target levels), payable on the termination date. All annual bonuses payable pursuant to the above will be payable in full in
cash, including with respect to any portion of the bonus that would otherwise be payable in equity-based awards.

CoBiz may take actions during the 2018 calendar year to the extent reasonably necessary in order to mitigate the impact of Sections 280G and 4999 of
the Code on CoBiz and CoBiz employees, respectively, including, but not limited to, accelerating all or a portion of the bonus for fiscal year 2018 to a
date no later than December 31, 2018 and accelerating the vesting and settlement of company stock options and restricted stock awards to a date no later
than December 31, 2018, subject to BOK’s approval.

Indemnification and Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance. From and after the effective time of the merger, BOK and Merger Sub will indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, CoBiz’s amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date of
the merger agreement or any agreements providing for indemnification by CoBiz or any of its subsidiaries, each present and former director, officer and
employee of CoBiz and its subsidiaries from liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether arising before or after the effective time of the merger, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, (i) the fact that such
person is or was a director, officer or employee of CoBiz or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) is or was serving at the request of CoBiz or any of its
subsidiaries as a director or officer of another entity and pertain to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger, including
matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the consideration and approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby. BOK and Merger Sub have agreed to maintain, at no cost to the beneficiaries, in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance maintained by CoBiz or provide substitute directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for the benefit of present and former officers and
directors of CoBiz with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring at or before the effective time of the
merger for a period of six years following the effective time of the merger. Any such substitute insurance must contain terms and conditions that are not
less advantageous than the current coverage provided by CoBiz, except that BOK and Merger Sub is not required to incur annual premium expense
greater than 300% of CoBiz’s current annual directors’ and officers’ liability insurance premium. In lieu of the foregoing, CoBiz, may obtain a six year
“tail” policy at or prior to the effective time of the merger under CoBiz’s existing directors and officers insurance policy on the terms in this paragraph.

No Solicitation. The merger agreement precludes CoBiz and its subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives
from initiating, soliciting, knowingly encouraging or knowingly facilitating inquiries or proposals with respect to, or engaging or participating in any
negotiations concerning, or providing any confidential or nonpublic information or data in connection with, or having or participating in any discussions
with any person relating to, or entering into any binding acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other definitive transaction agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement described in this paragraph) relating to, any Acquisition Proposal (defined below). However, if CoBiz receives an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal prior to the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby by CoBiz’s shareholders
and CoBiz’s Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and financial advisors) that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is more likely than not to result in a Superior Proposal (defined below), CoBiz may furnish nonpublic information or data and
participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that the Board of Directors of CoBiz concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and financial advisors) that failure to take such actions would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, provided that prior to providing any such nonpublic information or data, CoBiz will have provided such information to BOK and entered
into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on material terms no less favorable to it than

the confidentiality agreement between CoBiz and BOK. CoBiz has agreed to, as of the date of the merger agreement, terminate any activities,
discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of the merger agreement with any persons other than BOK with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, and to use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law and the fiduciary duties of its Board of Directors, to enforce any existing
confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement to which it or its subsidiaries is a party relating to an Acquisition Proposal in accordance with its terms.
CoBiz has also agreed to advise BOK within 24 hours following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry which could reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making such
inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), and to keep BOK apprised within 24 hours of any developments, discussions and negotiations, including any
amendments to or revisions of the terms of such Acquisition Proposal.
 

 

•  As used in the merger agreement, “Acquisition Proposal” means (other than the merger) any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any
third party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of CoBiz and
its subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of CoBiz or its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of CoBiz, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer
that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of CoBiz
or its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of CoBiz, or (iii) a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar
transaction involving CoBiz or its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated
assets of CoBiz, except, in each case, any sale of whole loans and securitizations in the ordinary course of business and any bond a fide
internal reorganizations.

 

 

•  As used in the merger agreement, “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that CoBiz’s Board of Directors
concludes in good faith to be more favorable to CoBiz’s shareholders than the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, (i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who must be a nationally recognized investment banking firm), (ii) after
taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii) after taking into account all
legal (with the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of
such proposal (including any expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to closing) and any other relevant factors permitted under
applicable law; provided, that for purposes of the definition of “Superior Proposal,” the references to “25%” in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to “a majority.”

Certain of these representations and warranties are qualified as to “materiality” or “material adverse effect.” For purposes of the merger agreement, a
“material adverse effect” with respect to BOK, CoBiz or Merger Sub, as the case may be, means any event, circumstance, development, change or
effect, that individually or in the aggregate, has a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or
financial condition of such person and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (provided, however, that, with respect to this clause (i), material adverse effect
shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes in GAAP or applicable regulatory accounting requirements or interpretations thereof,
(B) changes in laws, rules, regulations or agency requirements of general applicability to companies in the industries in which such person and its
subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or governmental entities, (C) changes in global, national or regional political conditions
(including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt markets, as well as changes in interest

internal or other estimates, predications, projections or forecasts of revenue, net income, or any other measure of financial performance (it being
understood that the underlying cause of such decline or failure may be taken into account in determining whether a material adverse effect on such
person has occurred) or (F) the expenses incurred by such person and its subsidiaries in negotiating, documenting, effecting and consummating the
transaction contemplated by the merger agreement; except, with respect to clauses (A), (B) or (C), to the extent that the effects of such change are
disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such person and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the industries in which such person and its subsidiaries operate) or (ii) prevents or materially
impairs, or would reasonably likely to prevent or materially impair, the ability of such person to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement. The representations and warranties in the merger agreement do not survive the effective time of the merger and, as described
below under “—Termination; Termination Fee,” if the merger agreement is validly terminated, there will be no liability under the representations and
warranties of the parties, or otherwise under the merger agreement, unless a party engaged in fraud or willfully breached the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

This summary and the copy of the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A are included solely to provide investors
with information regarding the terms of the merger agreement. They are not intended to provide factual information about the parties or any of their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates. The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by BOK and CoBiz, which were made only for
purposes of that agreement and as of specific dates. The representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement were made solely for the
benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by
confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the merger agreement instead of establishing these
matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those generally applicable to
investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement, and in reviewing the representations, warranties and covenants
contained in the merger agreement or any descriptions thereof in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that such representations, warranties and
covenants or any descriptions thereof were not intended by the parties to the merger agreement to be characterizations of the actual state of facts or
condition of BOK, CoBiz or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations,
warranties and covenants may change after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in BOK’s
and CoBiz’s public disclosures. For the foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions of those provisions should
not be read alone and should instead be read in conjunction with the other information contained in the reports, statements and filings that BOK and
CoBiz publicly file with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 102.

Conditions to the Merger

Conditions to Each Party’s Obligations. The respective obligations of each of BOK and CoBiz to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction of
the following conditions:
 

 •  receipt of the requisite approval of the CoBiz common shareholders of the merger agreement;
 

 •  approval for the listing on NASDAQ of the BOK common stock to be issued in connection with the merger;
 

 
•  the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4, of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part, and the absence of a stop

by CoBiz’s shareholders:
 

 •  by mutual written consent of BOK and CoBiz;
 

 

•  by either BOK or CoBiz, if a required regulatory approval is denied by final, non-appealable action, or if a governmental entity has issued a
final, non-appealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the closing of the merger or the bank merger,
unless the failure to obtain a required regulatory approval is due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to
perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in the merger agreement;

 

 
•  by either BOK or CoBiz, if the merger has not closed by June 17, 2019, unless the failure to close by the termination date is due to the

failure of the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in
the agreement;

 

 
•  by either BOK or CoBiz, if there is a breach by the other party that would, individually or in the aggregate with other breaches by such

party, result in the failure of a closing condition, unless the breach (if curable) is cured by the earlier of June 17, 2019 and 45 days following
written notice of the breach (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of the merger agreement);

 

 

•  by BOK, if, (i) prior to the approval of the merger agreement by CoBiz’s shareholders, the CoBiz Board of Directors (A) submits the merger
agreement to its shareholders without a recommendation for approval, or otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely modifies its
recommendation for approval (or publicly discloses an intention to do so), or recommends to its shareholders an Acquisition Proposal other
than the merger, or (B) breaches its obligation to call a shareholder meeting and recommend to its shareholders, in accordance with the terms
of the merger agreement, the approval of the merger agreement or materially breaches its obligation to refrain from soliciting alternative

senior management of CoBiz or made directly to its shareholders generally or any person has publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to

breached the merger agreement in such a way as would prevent certain closing conditions from being obtained and would give BOK the right to
terminate the merger agreement and (C) within one year after the termination of the merger agreement, an Acquisition Proposal is consummated
or any definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal is entered into (provided that for purposes of the foregoing, the term
“Acquisition Proposal” shall have the meaning assigned to such term elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, except that the references to
“25%” in the definition of an “Acquisition Proposal” elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus shall be deemed to be references to “50%”); or

 
(2) BOK terminates the merger agreement because (i) prior to the approval of the merger agreement by CoBiz’s shareholders, the CoBiz Board of

Directors (A) submits the merger agreement to its shareholders without a recommendation for approval, or otherwise withdraws or materially and
adversely modifies its recommendation for approval (or publicly discloses an intention to do so), or recommends to its shareholders an Acquisition
Proposal other than the merger, or (B) materially breaches its obligation to call a shareholder meeting and recommend to its shareholders, in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the approval of the merger agreement or to refrain from soliciting alternative acquisition

BOK or its subsidiaries) and the CoBiz Board of Directors recommends that BOK’s shareholders tender or exchange their shares (or fails to
recommend a rejection of such tender or exchange offer within ten business days).

Effect of Termination

If the merger agreement is validly terminated, it will become void without any liability on the part of any of the parties unless a party fraudulently or
willfully breaches the merger agreement. However, the provisions of the merger agreement relating to confidentiality obligations of the parties, the
termination fee and certain other technical provisions will continue in effect notwithstanding termination of the merger agreement.

Amendments, Extensions and Waivers

The merger agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after
approval of the matters presented in connection with the merger by the shareholders of CoBiz, in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties,
provided that after any approval of the merger agreement by the CoBiz shareholders, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders,
any amendment of the merger agreement that requires further approval under applicable law.

the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained in the merger agreement or any document delivered pursuant thereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in the merger agreement, provided that after any approval of the merger agreement by the CoBiz shareholders, there may not be, without
further approval of such shareholders, any extension or waiver of the merger agreement or any portion thereof that requires further approval under

At or prior to the effective time, Steven Bangert or, if Mr. Bangert is unable to be appointed, such other member of the Board of Directors of CoBiz

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

In accordance with current accounting guidance, the merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method. As a result, the recorded assets and
liabilities of BOK will be carried forward at their recorded amounts, the historical operating results will be unchanged for the prior periods being
reported on and the assets and liabilities of CoBiz will be adjusted to fair value at the date of the merger. In addition, all identified intangible assets will
be recorded at fair value and included as part of the net assets acquired. To the extent that the purchase price, consisting of cash plus the number of BOK
common shares to be issued to former CoBiz shareholders, option holders and holders of restricted stock awards, as applicable, at fair value, exceeds the
fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangible assets of CoBiz on the date the merger is completed, such amount will be reported as
goodwill. In accordance with current accounting guidance, goodwill will not be amortized but will be evaluated for impairment annually. Identified
finite life intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated lives. Further, the acquisition method of accounting will result in the operating results
of CoBiz being included in the operating results of BOK beginning from the date of completion of the merger.

DESCRIPTION OF BOK CAPITAL STOCK

The following descriptions of BOK capital stock are not complete. You should also read the BOK Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation,
our Bylaws and the General Corporation Act of the State of Oklahoma. We have filed copies of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws with the SEC. These documents are incorporated by reference into the registration statement of which this proxy statement-prospectus is a
part.

BOK has 3,500,000,000 shares of capital stock authorized, of which 2,500,000,000 shares are common stock, $0.00006 par value, and 1,000,000,000
shares are preferred stock, $0.00005 par value. As of August 14, 2018, BOK had 65,437,818 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and no
shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.

Common Stock

Each holder of shares of BOK common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted upon by its shareholders. The holders
of outstanding shares of BOK common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends out of assets legally available therefore as BOK board of
directors may determine. Upon BOK liquidation or dissolution, the holders of BOK common stock will be entitled to share ratably in BOK assets that
are legally available for distribution to shareholders after payment of liabilities. Holders of preferred stock may likewise be entitled to dividend and
liquidation preferences. BOK must pay the applicable distribution to the holders of BOK preferred stock before BOK may pay them to the holders of
BOK common stock. Holders of BOK common stock have no conversion, sinking fund, redemption, preemptive or subscription rights. In addition,
holders of BOK common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. BOK cannot further call or assess shares of BOK common stock.

Preferred Stock

The BOK board of directors has the authority to determine and alter the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any
unissued series of BOK preferred stock and to fix the number of shares, dividend rights, conversion or exchange rights, voting rights, redemption rights,
liquidation preferences and sinking funds of any series of our preferred stock. The authorized shares of BOK preferred stock will be available for
issuance without further action by BOK shareholders, unless shareholder action is required by applicable law or by the rules of a stock exchange on
which any series of our stock may be listed. The holders of BOK preferred stock will have the right to vote separately as a class on any proposal
involving fundamental changes in the rights of those holders as provided by the General Business Corporation Act of the State of Oklahoma.

This authority of the BOK board of directors gives it the power to approve the issuance of a series of preferred stock that could, depending on its terms,
either impede or facilitate the completion of a merger, tender offer or other takeover attempt. For example, the issuance of new shares might impede a
business combination if the terms of those shares include voting rights that would enable a holder to block business combinations. Conversely, the
issuance of new shares might facilitate a business combination if those shares have general voting rights sufficient to satisfy an applicable percentage
vote requirement.

If applicable, the terms on which BOK preferred stock may be convertible into or exchangeable for BOK common stock or our other securities will be
described in the applicable Certificate of Determination. The terms will include provisions as to whether conversion or exchange is mandatory, at the
option of the holder, or at BOK’s option, and may include provisions that adjust the number of shares of BOK common stock, or other securities of
BOK, that the holders of BOK preferred stock may receive.

Transfer Agent and Registrar

EQ Shareowner Services acts as transfer agent and registrar for BOK.

Restrictions on Ownership

The ability of a third party to acquire BOK’s stock is limited under applicable U.S. banking laws. The BHC Act requires any bank holding company to
obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of BOK’s outstanding common stock. Any
“company,” as defined in the BHC Act, other than a bank holding company, is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before
acquiring “control” of BOK. “Control” for purposes of the BHC Act generally means (i) the ownership or control of 25% or more of a class of voting
securities, (ii) the ability to control the election of a majority of the directors or (iii) the ability otherwise to exercise a controlling influence over
management and policies. A person, other than an individual, that controls BOK for purposes of the BHC Act is subject to regulation and supervision as
a bank holding company under the BHC Act. In addition, under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, and the Federal Reserve Board’s
regulations thereunder, a person, entity, or group of persons or entities acting in concert, is prohibited from acquiring “control” of a bank holding
company such as BOK unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given prior notice and has not objected to the transaction. The acquisition of more
than 10% of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with publicly held securities, such as BOK, generally would constitute the acquisition of
control of the bank holding company under the Change in Bank Control Act.

COMPARISON OF SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS

BOK is incorporated under the laws of the State of Oklahoma, and CoBiz is incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado. Upon completion of
the merger, CoBiz shareholders will receive shares of BOK common stock and cash as a result of the merger. Consequently, the rights of CoBiz’s
shareholders who receive shares of BOK common stock as a result of the merger will be governed by the OGCA, BOK’s amended and restated
certificate of incorporation and BOK’s bylaws. The following discussion summarizes certain material differences between the rights of holders of CoBiz
common stock and BOK’s common stock resulting from the differences in their governing documents and in the OGCA and the CBCA.

This discussion does not purport to be a complete statement of the rights of holders of BOK common stock under the OGCA, BOK’s amended and
restated certificate of incorporation (which we refer to as “BOK’s certificate of incorporation”) and BOK’s bylaws or the rights of holders of CoBiz
common stock under the OGCA, CoBiz’s amended articles of incorporation (which we refer to as “CoBiz’s articles of incorporation”) and CoBiz’s
amended and restated bylaws (which we refer to as the “CoBiz’s bylaws”), and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the governing corporate
documents of BOK and CoBiz and applicable law. For more information, see “Where You Can Find More Information,” beginning on page 102.

preferred stock, par value $.01 per share. As of the record date, there
were 42,397,697 shares of CoBiz common stock outstanding and no
shares of CoBiz preferred stock outstanding.

Board of Directors
Section 1027 of the OGCA provides that the board of directors shall consist
of one or more members, with the number fixed by or in the manner provided
for in the bylaws, unless the certificate of incorporation fixes the number of
directors, in which case a change in the number of directors shall be made
only by amendment of the certificate.
 

BOK’s bylaws state that the number of directors comprising the board of
directors shall not be less than one and not more than twenty-five, as
determined by the vote of the shareholders at the annual meeting, or at a
special meeting called for such purpose.
 

BOK does not have a classified board of directors and BOK’s certificate of
incorporation and bylaws do not provide for cumulative voting in the election
of directors. Directors are elected annually to BOK’s board of directors for
one-year terms.

  

Sections 7-102-102 and 7-108-103 of the CBCA provide that the board
of directors shall consist of one or more members, with the number
stated in or fixed in accordance with the articles of incorporation or the
bylaws.
 

CoBiz’s articles of incorporation state that the number of directors
comprising the board of directors shall not be less than three and will
be determined from time to time by a majority of the CoBiz board of
directors. CoBiz’s bylaws state that the number of directors shall be
fixed from time to time by resolution adopted by a majority of the
entire board of directors. CoBiz currently has twelve directors.

Removal of Directors
As described above under “—Board of Directors,” BOK does not have a
classified board of directors and no cumulative voting is allowed.
Section 1027(H) of the OGCA provides that any director or the entire board
of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a
majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors, unless
the certificate of incorporation otherwise provides. BOK’s bylaws provide
that the entire board of directors or any individual director, may be removed
from office, with or without cause, by a vote of a majority of the outstanding
share entitled to vote at any annual, regular or special meeting of the
shareholders.

  

As described above under “—Board of Directors,” CoBiz does not
have a classified board of directors.
Under Section 7-108-108 of the CBCA, any director or the entire board
of directors may be removed with or without cause unless the articles
of incorporation provide that directors may be removed by the
shareholders only for cause. CoBiz’s articles of incorporation do not
provide that a director may be removed only for cause. A director may
be removed by vote of the shareholders, only at a meeting called for the
purpose of removing a director, with the meeting notice having stated
such purpose, and only if the number of votes cast in favor of removal
exceeds the number of votes cast against removal.

Filling Vacancies on the Board of Directors
BOK’s bylaws provide that any vacancy occurring in the board of directors
by reason of death or resignation may be filled by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the remaining directors, though less than a quorum of the board of
directors. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the
unexpired term of his predecessor in office. Any directorship to be filled by
reason of an increase in the number of directors shall be filled by election at
the annual, regular or special meeting of shareholders which increased the
number of directors. Any directorship or directorships to be filled by reason
of a removal by the shareholders shall be filled by election at the annual,
regular or special meeting which voted the removal.   

Section 7-108-110 of the CBCA provides that vacancies resulting from
the removal of directors may be filled by the shareholders or the board
of directors. Pursuant to CoBiz’s bylaws, vacancies, including
vacancies resulting from an increase in the number of directors, shall
be filled by the affirmative vote of the majority of the remaining
directors, whether or not they constitute a quorum.

Amendment of Articles of Incorporation/Certificate of Incorporation
Section 1077 of the OGCA provides that any amendment to a corporation’s
certificate of incorporation must be approved at a special or annual meeting
by a majority of the outstanding shares of each class entitled to vote as a class
upon a proposed amendment, whether or not entitled to vote by the provisions
of the certificate of incorporation, if the amendment would increase or
decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of the class, increase or
decrease the par value of the shares of the class, or alter or change the
powers, preferences or special rights of the shares of the class so as to affect
them adversely.
 

Pursuant to Section 1077 of the OGCA, either of the following amendments
may be authorized by or pursuant to authorization by the board of directors
alone:
 

•  to change its corporate name   

Section 7-107-206(3) of the CBCA provides that action on a matter
other than the election of directors (or the approval of a merger as
stated in Section 7-111-103(5) of the CBCA) by a voting group is
approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action
exceed the votes cast within the voting group opposing the action.
 

Pursuant to Section 7-110-102 of the CBCA, any of the following
amendments may be authorized by or pursuant to authorization by the
board of directors alone:
 

•  To delete the statement of the principal office address of the
initial principal office, if a statement of change changing the
principal office address is on file in the records of the
secretary of state;

•  to delete such provisions as were necessary to effect a change,
exchange, reclassification, subdivision, combination or cancellation
of stock, if such change, exchange, reclassification, subdivision,
combination or cancellation has become effective.

 

BOK’s certificate of incorporation does not contain any special provision
dealing with amendments to its certificate of incorporation. Therefore BOK’s
certificate of incorporation may be amended by a majority vote of the
shareholders in accordance with the OGCA.   

 

•  To delete the statement of the registered agent name and
registered agent address of the initial registered agent, if a
statement of change changing the registered agent name and
registered agent address of the registered agent is on file in
the records of the secretary of state; and

 

•  To make further changes for which the board of directors is
authorized pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to
act alone.

Amendment of Bylaws
BOK’s bylaws provide that they may be amended by a majority vote of a
quorum of the members of the board of directors at any annual, regular or
special meeting duly convened after notice to the directors setting out the
purpose of the meeting, subject to the power of the shareholders to alter or
repeal such bylaws; provided, however, the board of directors shall not adopt
or alter any bylaw fixing the number, qualifications, classification or terms of
office, by any such bylaw may be adopted or altered only by a majority vote
of a quorum of the shareholders.   

CoBiz’s bylaws provide that the bylaws may be amended or repealed
by a majority vote of the directors at any regular or special meeting of
the board of directors unless the shareholders, in making, amending or
repealing a particular bylaw, expressly provide that the directors may
not amend or repeal such bylaw. The shareholders also have the power
to make, amend or repeal CoBiz’s bylaws at any annual meeting of the
shareholders or at any special meeting of the shareholders called for
that purpose.

Notice of Shareholders Meetings
Section 1067 of the OCGA provides that written notice of any shareholders’
meeting must be given to each shareholder not less than 10 nor more than 60
days before the meeting date.
 

BOK’s bylaws provide that written notice of any shareholders’ meeting must
be given to each shareholder not less than 10 nor more than 40 days before
the meeting date.   

In accordance with Section 7-107-105 of the CBCA, CoBiz’s bylaws
provide that written notice of any shareholders’ meeting must be given
to each shareholder not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the
meeting date.

Right to Call Special Meeting of Shareholders
BOK’s bylaws provide that special meetings of the shareholders, for any
purpose or purposes whatsoever, may be called by the president, the board of
directors or the executive committee, and shall be called by the president at
the request of one or more shareholders holding not less than one-fourth of
the voting power of all the outstanding shares of the corporation entitled to
vote at the meeting.

  

CoBiz’s bylaws authorize the calling of a special meeting of
shareholders by the board, the chairman, the chief executive officer or
the president. The president may call a special meeting of the
shareholders if CoBiz receives one or more written demands for the
meeting, stating the purpose or purposes for which it is to be held,
signed by shareholders owning, in the aggregate, shares representing
not less than 10% of the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed
to be considered at the meeting.

Shareholder Nominations and Proposals
BOK’s bylaws do not address shareholder nominations and proposals.
Shareholders who wish to submit a director candidate for consideration
should submit such nomination to the board of directors for consideration.
The board of directors will consider proposals of shareholders intended to be
presented for action at the annual meeting of shareholders.

  

CoBiz’s bylaws require a shareholder who intends to nominate a
candidate for election to the board of directors at a meeting of
shareholders to give notice not less than 120 days and not more than
180 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual
meeting to the secretary. If the date of the annual meeting is advanced
more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the
anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting, then notice by the
shareholder must be delivered to the secretary not later than the close
of business on the later of (1) the 90th day prior to such annual meeting
or (2) the 15th day following the day on which public announcement of
the date of such meeting is first made.

Indemnification of Officers, Directors and Employees
Under Section 1031 of the OGCA, a corporation may indemnity its directors
and officers made a party to a proceeding because the person was a director
or officer, against expenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgements and fines,
and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred, whether in
civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative proceedings, by him or her if
the person acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe his or her conduct was unlawful. A corporation may not indemnify a
director or officer under this section in respect of any claim or matter as to
which the person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation
unless and only to the extent that the court in which the action was brought
shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but
in view of all the circumstances of the case, the person is fairly and
reasonably entitled to indemnity for expenses which the court shall deem
proper.
 

BOK’s bylaws provide that BOK shall indemnify each director and officer to
the fullest extent provided by the OGCA, subject to the following limitations:
 

•  Amounts paid or payable by a director or officer to BOK or another
corporation shall not be subject to indemnification.

 

•  A director or officer who has been wholly successful, on the merits
or otherwise, in defense of a claim, action, suit or proceeding

  

Under Sections 7-109-102 and 7-109-107 of the CBCA, a corporation
may indemnify its directors or officers made a party to a proceeding
because the person was a director or officer if: (a) the person’s conduct
was in good faith; and (b) the director or officer reasonably believed:
(I) in the case of conduct in an official capacity with the corporation,
that such conduct was in the corporation’s best interests; and (II) in all
other cases, that such conduct was at least not opposed to the
corporation’s best interests; and (c) in the case of any criminal
proceeding, the person had no reasonable cause to believe the person’s
conduct was unlawful. A corporation may not indemnify a director or
officer under this section: (a) in connection with a proceeding by or in
the right of the corporation in which the director or officer was
adjudged liable to the corporation; or (b) in connection with any other
proceeding charging that the director or officer derived an improper
personal benefit, whether or not involving action in an official capacity,
in which proceeding the director or officer was adjudged liable on the
basis that the director or officer derived an improper personal benefit.
 

CoBiz’s bylaws provide that CoBiz shall indemnify and advance
expenses to each of its directors and officers to the maximum extent
now or hereafter permitted by the CBCA.

director to such extent now or hereafter permitted by the CBCA as
CoBiz may determine by general or specific action of the board of
directors, by contract or otherwise.

Anti-Takeover Provisions
BOK’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorize its board
of directors to issue preferred stock, with or without shareholder approval,
which could have dividend, redemption, liquidations, conversion, voting or
other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of
holders of BOK common stock.   

Neither the CBCA nor CoBiz’s articles of incorporation or bylaws
address business combinations with interested shareholders.

Shareholder Approval of a Merger
Under Sections 1081 and 1082 of the OGCA, an agreement of merger must
be adopted by the board of directors and approved by shareholders holding a
majority of the outstanding stock of BOK entitled to vote thereon.   

Under Sections 7-111-101 and 7-111-103 of the CBCA, a plan of
merger must be adopted by the board of directors and approved by the
shareholders having a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast.

Shareholder Action Without a Meeting
BOK’s bylaws provide that any action required to be taken at a meeting of the
shareholders, or any other action which may be taken at a meeting of the
shareholders, may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting
forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares
having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote
thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of any such
corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent
shall be given to those shareholders who have not consented in writing.

  

Under Section 7-107-104 of the CBCA, any action that may be taken at
a meeting of shareholders may be taken without a meeting by
unanimous written consent of the holders of all of the outstanding
shares of stock entitled to vote on such action, unless the articles of
incorporation require that such action be taken at a shareholders’
meeting. If the articles of incorporation expressly so permit, any such
action may be taken by written consent of the holders of the
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes
that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.
However, CoBiz’s articles of incorporation do not permit actions by
less than unanimous written consent of shareholders; therefore any
such action can be taken only by unanimous written consent.

Appraisal Rights
Appraisal rights of BOK shareholders are governed by Section 1091 of the
OGCA. Generally, except for certain cash transactions, Section 1091 does not
provide appraisal rights for stock transactions involving shares which are
listed on a national securities exchange. BOK common stock, which trades on
NASDAQ, would not currently be subject to appraisal rights unless otherwise
provided by Section 1091 of the OGCA.

  

Under Section 7-113-102 of the CBCA, a shareholder, whether or not
entitled to vote, is entitled to dissent and obtain payment of the fair
value of the shareholder’s shares in the event of the consummation of a
plan of merger to which the corporation is a party if approval by the
shareholders of that corporation is required for the merger by Sections
7-111-103 or 7-111-104 of the CBCA. Approval of the merger is
required by Section 7-111-103 of the CBCA.
 

Under Section 7-113-102(1.3) of the CBCA, a shareholder is not
entitled to dissent and obtain payment of the fair value of the shares of
any class or series of shares that either were listed on a national
securities exchange registered under the federal “Securities Exchange
Act of 1934”, as amended, or were held of record by more than two
thousand shareholders, at the time of the record date.
 

However, this provision does not apply if the shareholders will receive,
for such shareholder’s shares, anything except cash in lieu of fractional
shares or shares of the corporation surviving the consummation of the
plan of merger or shares of any other corporation which will be listed
on a national securities exchanged registered under the federal
“Securities Exchange Act of 1934”, as amended, or will be held of
record by more than two thousand shareholders.
 

Section 7-113-102 of the CBCA provides that a CoBiz shareholder
who wishes to assert dissenters’ rights shall: (a) cause CoBiz to receive
before the vote is taken on the merger at the special meeting, written
notice of the shareholder’s intention to demand payment for the
shareholder’s shares if the merger is effectuated; and (b) not vote the
shares in favor of the merger. A CoBiz shareholder who does not
satisfy the foregoing requirements will not be entitled to demand
payment for his or her shares under Article 113 of the CBCA.

Dividends
Pursuant to the BOK bylaws, the board of directors may declare, and BOK
may pay, dividends on its outstanding shares in cash, property or its own
shares, subject to Section 1049 of the OGCA which provides, among other
restrictions, that dividends may only be paid out of surplus, or in the case
there is not such surplus, out of   

CoBiz can pay dividends, as and when legally declared by the board of

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

Appraisal Rights

CoBiz is incorporated under Colorado law. Under Article 113 of the CBCA CoBiz shareholders have the right to dissent from the proposed merger and,
subject to certain conditions provided for under the Colorado dissenters’ rights statutes, are entitled to receive payment of the fair value of their CoBiz
common stock. CoBiz shareholders will be bound by the terms of the merger unless they dissent by complying with all of the requirements of the
Colorado dissenters’ rights statutes. The following is a summary of dissenters’ rights available to CoBiz’s shareholders, which summary is not intended
to be a complete statement of applicable Colorado law and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Article 113 of the CBCA, which is set forth in its
entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus.

Right to Dissent

CoBiz shareholders are entitled to dissent from the merger and obtain payment of the fair value of their shares if and when the merger is consummated.
“Fair value,” with respect to a dissenter’s shares, means the value of the shares immediately before the effective date of the merger, excluding any
appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the merger except to the extent that exclusion would be inequitable. Under Article 113 of the CBCA, a
shareholder entitled to dissent and obtain payment for his, her or its shares may not also challenge the corporate action creating the right to dissent
unless the action is unlawful or fraudulent with respect to the shareholder or the corporation.

Under Section 7-113-103 of the CBCA a record shareholder may assert dissenters’ rights as to fewer than all shares registered in the record
shareholder’s name only if the record shareholder dissents with respect to all shares beneficially owned by any one person and causes the corporation to
receive written notice which states such dissent and the name, address and federal taxpayer identification number, if any, of each person on whose behalf
the record shareholder asserts dissenters’ rights.

Section 7-113-103(2) of the CBCA provides that a beneficial shareholder may assert dissenters’ rights as to the shares held on the beneficial
shareholder’s behalf only if (a) the beneficial shareholder causes the corporation to receive the record shareholder’s written consent to the dissent not
later than the time the beneficial shareholder asserts dissenters’ rights and (b) the beneficial shareholder dissents with respect to all shares beneficially
owned by the beneficial shareholder.

CoBiz will require that, when a record shareholder dissents with respect to the shares held by any one or more beneficial shareholders, each such
beneficial shareholder must certify to CoBiz that the beneficial shareholder and record shareholder has asserted, or will timely assert, dissenters’ rights
as to all such shares as to which there is no limitation on the ability to exercise dissenters’ rights.

Procedure for Exercise of Dissenters’ Rights

The notice accompanying this proxy statement/prospectus states that shareholders of CoBiz are entitled to assert dissenters’ rights under Article 113 of
the CBCA. A CoBiz shareholder who wishes to assert dissenters’ rights shall: (a) cause CoBiz to receive before the vote is taken on the merger at the
special meeting, written notice of the shareholder’s intention to demand payment for the shareholder’s shares if the merger is effectuated; and (b) not
vote the shares in favor of the merger. A CoBiz shareholder who does not satisfy the foregoing requirements will not be entitled to demand payment for
his or her shares under Article 113 of the CBCA.

Dissenters’ Notice

If the merger agreement is approved at the special meeting, CoBiz will send written notice to dissenters who are entitled to demand payment for their
shares. The notice required by CoBiz will be given no later than 10 days

after the effective date of the merger and will: (a) state that the merger agreement was approved and state the effective date or proposed effective date of
the merger, (b) set forth an address at which CoBiz will receive payment demands and the address of a place where certificates must be deposited,
(c) inform holders of uncertificated shares to what extent transfer of the shares will be restricted after the payment demand is received, (d) supply a form
for demanding payment, which form shall request a dissenter to state an address to which payment is to be made, (e) set the date by which CoBiz must
receive the payment demand and certificates for shares, which date will not be less than 30 days after the date the notice is given, (f) state that if a record
CoBiz shareholder dissents with respect to the shares held by any one or more beneficial shareholders each such beneficial shareholder must certify to
CoBiz that the beneficial shareholder and the record shareholder or record shareholders of all shares owned beneficially by the beneficial shareholder
have asserted, or will timely assert, dissenters’ rights as to all such shares as to which there is no limitation of the ability to exercise dissenters’ rights,
and (g) be accompanied by a copy of Article 113 of the CBCA.

Procedure to Demand Payment

A shareholder who is given a dissenters’ notice to assert dissenters’ rights will, in accordance with the terms of the dissenters’ notice, (a) cause CoBiz to
receive a payment demand (which may be a demand form supplied by CoBiz and duly completed or other acceptable writing) and (b) deposit the
shareholder’s stock certificates. A shareholder who demands payment in accordance with the foregoing retains all rights of a shareholder, except the
right to transfer the shares until the effective date of the merger, and has only the right to receive payment for the shares after the effective date of the
merger. A demand for payment and deposit of certificates is irrevocable except that if the effective date of the merger does not occur within 60 days
after the date set by CoBiz by which it must receive the payment demand, CoBiz will return the deposited certificates and release the transfer restrictions
imposed. If the effective date occurs more than 60 days after the date set by CoBiz by which it must receive the payment demand, then CoBiz will send
a new dissenters’ notice. A CoBiz shareholder who does not demand payment and deposit his or her CoBiz share certificates as required by the date or
dates set forth in the dissenters’ notice will not be entitled to demand payment for his, her or its CoBiz shares under Article 113 of the CBCA, and he,
she or it will receive cash and stock consideration for each of his, her or its shares the same as received by non-dissenting shareholders.

Payment

At the effective date of the merger or upon receipt of a payment demand, whichever is later, CoBiz will pay each dissenter who complied with the notice
requirements referenced in the preceding paragraph the CoBiz estimate of the fair value of the dissenter’s shares plus accrued interest. Payment shall be
accompanied by an audited balance sheet as of the end of the most recent fiscal year of CoBiz or, an audited income statement for that year, and an
audited statement of changes in shareholders’ equity for that year and an audited statement of cash flow for that year, as well as the latest available
financial statements, if any, for the interim period, which interim financial statements will be unaudited. Payment will also be accompanied by a
statement of the estimate by CoBiz of the fair value of the shares and an explanation of how the interest was calculated, along with a statement of the
dissenter’s right to demand payment and a copy of Article 113 of the CBCA. With respect to a dissenter who acquired beneficial ownership of his, her or
its shares after CoBiz’s first announcement of the terms of the transaction on June 18, 2018, or who does not certify that his, her or its shares were
acquired before that date, CoBiz may, in lieu of making the payment described above, offer to make such payment if the dissenter agrees to accept it in
full satisfaction of the demand.

If Dissenter is Dissatisfied with Offer

If a dissenter disagrees with the CoBiz’s payment or offer, such dissenter (1) may give notice to CoBiz in writing of the dissenter’s estimate of the fair
value of the dissenter’s shares and of the amount of interest due and may demand payment of such estimate, less any payment made prior thereto, or
(2) reject the offer of CoBiz and demand payment of the fair value of the shares and interest due if: (a) the dissenter believes that the amount paid

Table of Contents

or offered is less than the fair value of the shares or that the interest due was incorrectly calculated, (b) CoBiz fails to make payment within 60 days after
the date set by CoBiz by which it must receive the payment demand or (c) CoBiz does not return deposited certificates and release transfer restrictions if
the effective date is more than 60 days after the date set by CoBiz by which the payment demand must be received by the shareholder asserting
dissenters’ rights. A dissenter waives the right to demand payment under this paragraph unless he or she causes CoBiz to receive the notice referenced in
this paragraph within 30 days after CoBiz makes or offers payment for the shares of the dissenter, in which event, such dissenter will receive all cash for
his or her CoBiz shares in an amount equal to the amount paid or offered by CoBiz.

Judicial Appraisal of Shares.

If a demand for payment made by a dissenter as set forth above is unresolved, CoBiz may, within 60 days after receiving the payment demand,
commence a proceeding and petition a court to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest. If CoBiz does not commence the proceeding
within the 60 day period, it shall pay to each dissenter whose demand remains unresolved the amount demanded. CoBiz must commence any proceeding
described above in the District Court of the City and County of Denver, Colorado. CoBiz shall make all dissenters whose demands remain unresolved
parties to the proceeding as in an action against their shares, and all parties shall be served with a copy of the petition. Jurisdiction in which the
proceeding is commenced is plenary and exclusive. One or more persons may be appointed by the court as appraisers to receive evidence and
recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers will have the power described in the court order appointing them. The parties to the
proceeding will be entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings. Each dissenter made a party to the proceeding will be
entitled to judgment for the amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of the dissenter’s shares, plus interest, to exceed the amount paid by
CoBiz, or for the fair value, plus interest, of a dissenters’ shares for which CoBiz elected to withhold payment.

Court and Counsel Fees

The court in an appraisal proceeding shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers
appointed by the court. The court will assess the costs against CoBiz; except that the court may assess costs against all or some of the dissenters, in the
amount the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds that the dissenters acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith in demanding
payment. The court may also assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties, in amounts the court finds equitable:
(a) against CoBiz and in favor of the dissenters if the court finds that CoBiz did not substantially comply with its obligations under Article 113, or
(b) against either CoBiz or one or more dissenters, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party against whom the fees and expenses are
assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by Article 113 of the CBCA. If the court finds that the
services of counsel for any dissenter were of substantial benefit to the other dissenters similarly situated, and that the fees for those services should not
be assessed against CoBiz, the court may award to such counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amount awarded to the dissenters who were
benefited.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 17, 2018 (this “Agreement”), by and among CoBiz Financial Inc., a Colorado
corporation (the “Company”), BOK Financial Corporation, an Oklahoma corporation (“Purchaser”) and BOKF Merger Corporation Number Sixteen, an
Oklahoma corporation and direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser (“Merger Sub”).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
companies and their shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which the Company
will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Merger Sub (the “Merger”), so that Merger Sub is the surviving
corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the “Surviving Corporation”) in the Merger; and

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a “plan of
reorganization” for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1. The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the Colorado Business Corporation Act (the
“CBCA”) and the Oklahoma General Corporation Act (the “OGCA”), at the Effective Time, the Company shall merge with and into Merger Sub.
Merger Sub shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. Upon
consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall terminate.

1.2. Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place at 8:00 a.m.
mountain time at the offices of the Company, on a date which shall be no later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to
applicable law) of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), or such other date or time mutually agreed in writing by the parties (the
“Closing Date”).

1.3. Effective Time. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, the Company and Purchaser (on behalf of
Merger Sub) shall file or cause to be filed (a) a statement of merger containing such information as is required by the relevant provisions of the CBCA in
order to effect the Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Colorado (the “Statement of Merger”) and (b) a certificate of merger containing
such information as is required by the relevant provisions of the OGCA in order to effect the Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Oklahoma (the “Certificate of Merger”). The Merger shall become effective at such time as is specified in the Statement of Merger and Certificate of
Merger (such time, the “Effective Time”).

Table of Contents

1.4. Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the
CBCA and the OGCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

1.5. Conversion of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Purchaser, Merger Sub the Company or the holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Subject to Section 2.2(e) and Section 8.1(f), each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Company
Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for Dissenting Shares or shares of Company Common Stock
owned by the Company as treasury stock or otherwise owned by the Company, Purchaser or Merger Sub (in each case other than shares of Company
Common Stock (i) held in Company Benefit Plans or trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary or
agency capacity, or (ii) shares held, directly or indirectly, in respect of debts previously contracted, collectively the “Excluded Shares”), shall be
converted into the right to receive, without interest, (i) 0.17 shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of the common stock, par value $0.00006 per share, of
Purchaser (the “Purchaser Common Stock”) and (ii) $5.70 in cash (the “Per Share Cash Consideration”) (the consideration described in (i) and (ii), the
“Merger Consideration”).

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this ARTICLE I
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a
“Certificate”, it being understood that any reference herein to “Certificate” shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements
relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Section 1.5 and Section 2.2(e), without any interest thereon,
and (iii) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2. Certificates previously representing
shares of Company Common Stock shall be exchanged for certificates or, at Purchaser’s option, evidence of shares in book-entry form (collectively, the
“New Certificates”) representing whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock and cash as set forth in 1.5(a) (together with any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with
Section 2.2, without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock or Company Common
Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be
any extraordinary dividend or distribution, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio to give the holders of the
Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, all shares of the Company Common Stock that are
owned by the Company, Purchaser or Merger Sub (in each case other than the Excluded Shares) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and neither
the Merger Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

1.6. Purchaser Common Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of Purchaser Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

Table of Contents

1.7. Merger Sub Common Stock. The common stock of Merger Sub, par value $1.00 per share (the “Merger Sub Common Stock”), issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and shall constitute the only outstanding common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

1.8. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of the Company Common Stock that are issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by a Company shareholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or
consent thereto in writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands the fair value of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, the provisions of Article 113 of the CBCA (the “Dissenting Shareholders”), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (the “Dissenting Shares”), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Article 113 of the CBCA (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided for
pursuant to the provisions of Article 113 of the CBCA and this Section 1.7), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such rights to demand or receive the fair value of such shares of the Company Common Stock under the applicable
provisions of the CBCA. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such rights, such holder’s
shares of the Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive,
as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share of the Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section 1.5, without any
interest thereon. The Company shall give Purchaser prompt notice of any written notices to exercise dissenters’ rights in respect of any shares of the
Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments served pursuant to the CBCA and received by Company
relating to Dissenting Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for payment.

1.9. Treatment of Company Equity Awards. (a) At the Effective Time, each option granted by the Company to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock under the Company Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
(a “Company Stock Option”) shall fully vest and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with
respect to a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the (x) product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of (i) the sum of the Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash
Consideration over (ii) the exercise price per share, divided by (y) the sum of the Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash Consideration.
Purchaser shall issue the consideration described in this Section 1.9(a), less applicable tax withholdings, within five (5) business days following the
Closing Date. Any applicable tax withholdings shall first be applied to reduce the Per Share Cash Consideration payable in respect of the holder’s
Company Stock Options and to the extent the applicable tax withholdings exceeds the Per Share Cash Consideration payable in respect of the holder’s
Company Stock Options, the balance of the applicable tax withholdings shall be applied to reduce the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock

the Per Share Cash Consideration payable in respect of the holder’s Company RSUs and to the extent the applicable tax withholdings exceeds the Per
Share Cash Consideration payable in respect of the holder’s Company RSUs, the balance of the applicable tax withholdings shall be applied to reduce

(c) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse
restriction granted under the Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company Restricted Stock Award”,
and together with Company Stock Options and Company RSUs, “Company Equity Awards”) shall fully vest and shall be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock underlying such Company
Restricted Stock Award. Purchaser shall issue the consideration described in this Section 1.9 less applicable tax withholdings, within five (5) business
days following the Closing Date. Any applicable tax withholdings shall first be applied to reduce the Per Share Cash Consideration payable in respect of
the holder’s Company Restricted Stock Awards and to the extent the applicable tax withholdings exceeds the Per Share Cash Consideration payable in
respect of the holder’s Company Restricted Stock Awards, the balance of the applicable tax withholdings shall be applied to reduce the number of shares
of Purchaser Common Stock payable in respect of the holder’s Company Restricted Stock Awards based on the Purchaser Share Closing Price.

settlement of Company Equity Awards contemplated by this Section 1.9.

(ii) “Per Share Stock Consideration” means the product of (A) the Exchange Ratio times (B) the Purchaser Share Closing Price.

1.10. Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub (the “Merger
Sub Articles”), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable law.

1.11. Bylaws of Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub (the “Merger Sub Bylaws”), as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

as is determined by Purchaser in its sole discretion.

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1. Purchaser to Make Shares Available. At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a
bank or trust company designated by Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”) pursuant to an agreement entered
into by Purchaser prior to the Closing that is reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in
accordance with this ARTICLE II, (a) New Certificates to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5 and exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange for
outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock and (b) cash in an amount sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate cash portion of the Merger
Consideration and (ii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and New Certificates described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto (after giving effect to Section 6.10, being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Purchaser, provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall
affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Certificates. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
paid to Purchaser.

2.2. Exchange of Shares. (a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) days thereafter, Purchaser
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates representing shares of the Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to
ARTICLE I, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
certificates representing the number of whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock, the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon proper surrender of a Certificate
or Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that number of
whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock to which such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of
ARTICLE I and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) the cash portion of the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive in
respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE II, (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such
holder has the right to receive in respect of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE II and (C) any

the Merger Consideration or any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to the Purchaser Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this ARTICLE II. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this ARTICLE II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without
any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of the Purchaser Common Stock which the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted into the right to receive.

(c) If any certificate representing shares of the Purchaser Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the
person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate representing shares of the Purchaser Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of the Company Common
Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and
dividends or distributions that the holder presenting such certificate is entitled to as provided in this ARTICLE II.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of the Purchaser
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to the Purchaser Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a shareholder of Purchaser. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Purchaser shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company
who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the
average of the closing-sale prices of Purchaser Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) as reported by The
Wall Street Journal for the five (5) full trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the “Purchaser Share Closing
Price”) by (ii) the fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of the Purchaser Common Stock which such
holder (taking into account all fractional share interests to be received by such holder) would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be paid to Purchaser. Any former shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II shall
thereafter look only to Purchaser for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on the Purchaser Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of the Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Purchaser, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of the Company Common Stock for any
amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any cash portion of the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to this Section 2.2
or any other cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of the Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards, as
applicable, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the
appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards, as applicable, in respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Purchaser or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Purchaser, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Purchaser may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and dividends or
distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Purchaser concurrently herewith (the “Company Disclosure
Schedule”); provided, that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the
related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company that such item represents a material exception or fact, event
or circumstance or that such item is reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (iii) any disclosures made with
respect to a section of ARTICLE III shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of ARTICLE III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and
(2) other sections of ARTICLE III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a
reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections or (b) as disclosed in any Company Reports filed by the Company since
January 1, 2017 (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading “Risk Factors,” or disclosures of risks set forth in any “forward-
looking statements” disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser and Merger Sub as follows:

3.1. Corporate Organization. (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Colorado, is a bank holding company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), which has
elected to be, and qualifies as, a financial holding company under the BHC Act. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all
of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term “Material Adverse Effect” means, with respect to the Company,
Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, any event, circumstance, development, change or effect that, individually or in the
aggregate, has a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial

condition of such person and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (provided, however, that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not
be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) or applicable regulatory accounting
requirements or interpretations thereof, (B) changes in laws, rules, regulations or agency requirements of general applicability to companies in the
industries in which such person and its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes in global,
national or regional political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt
markets, as well as changes in interest rates) conditions, (D) public disclosure of the execution of this Agreement, public disclosure or consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (including any effect on such person’s or its Subsidiaries’ relationships with its customers, employees or other
persons) or actions expressly required by this Agreement or actions or omissions that are taken with the prior written consent of or at the written
direction of Purchaser, in the case of the Company, or the Company, in the case of Purchaser, (E) a decline in the trading price of the such person’s
common stock or the failure, in and of itself, to meet internal or other estimates, predications, projections or forecasts of revenue, net income or any
other measure of financial performance (it being understood that the underlying cause of such decline or failure may be taken into account in
determining whether a Material Adverse Effect on such person has occurred) or (F) the expenses incurred by such person and its Subsidiaries in
negotiating, documenting, effecting and consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; except, with respect to subclauses (A), (B) or
(C), to the extent that the effects of such change are disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or
financial condition of such person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the industries in such person and its
Subsidiaries operate); or (ii) prevents or materially impairs, or would be reasonably likely to prevent or materially impair, the ability of such person to
timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word “Subsidiary” when used with respect to any person,
means any other person Controlled by such person, whether directly or indirectly, or any other person who owns securities or other ownership interests
having a majority of the economic interest or voting power of such person. As used in this Agreement, the word “Control” and the correlative terms
“Controlling” and “Controlled”, means, with respect to any specified person, the power to direct the management and policies of such person, directly or
indirectly, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. True and complete copies of the Amended and Restated Articles
of Incorporation of the Company (the “Company Articles”) and the By-Laws of the Company (the “Company Bylaws”), as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by the Company to Purchaser.

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (a “Company Subsidiary”) (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company and (iii) has all requisite corporate (or similar) power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted in all material respects. There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of the Company to pay dividends or distributions except for
restrictions on dividends or distributions under applicable law and, in the case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or
distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The deposit accounts of the Company Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the “FDIC”) to the fullest extent permitted by law, all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been
paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. Section 3.1(b) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all Subsidiaries of the Company as of the date hereof.

for issuance or outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness that have the right to vote on any
matters on which shareholders of the Company may vote. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of
this Agreement no trust preferred or subordinated debt securities of the Company are issued or outstanding. Other than Company Stock Options,
Company RSUs and Company Restricted Stock Awards, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or
convertible securities or other commitments or agreements obligating the Company to issue, transfer, sell, purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any
such securities. There are no voting trusts, shareholder agreements, proxies or other agreements in effect pursuant to which the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries has a contractual obligation with respect to the voting or transfer of the Company Common Stock or other equity interests of the
Company.

(b) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of
each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (“Liens”), and all of
such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. No
Company Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character
calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right
to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary.

3.3. Authority; No Violation. (a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger have been duly

terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, (ii) directed that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to the Company’s shareholders for approval at a meeting of such shareholders and resolved to

the foregoing effect. Except for the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) by the affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Company Common Stock entitled to vote (the “Requisite Company Vote”), and the adoption and approval
of the Bank Merger Agreement by Company Bank and the Company as its sole shareholder, no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company
are necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Company and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Purchaser and Merger Sub) constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of
equitable remedies (the “Enforceability Exceptions”)).

contemplated hereby, nor compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i) violate any provision of the Company Articles
or the Company Bylaws or (ii) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings referred to in Sections 3.4 and 4.4 are duly obtained and/or made,

respect thereto and (iv) have been prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in
each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. The books and records of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries have been, since January 1,
2016, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and
reflect only actual transactions. Ernst & Young LLP has not resigned (or informed Purchaser that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent
public accountants of Purchaser as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Purchaser on a matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser,
neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due)
required by GAAP to be included on a consolidated balance sheet of Purchaser, except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of Purchaser included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018 (including any notes

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated
under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and
direct control of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive
ownership and non-direct control that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser. Purchaser (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Purchaser, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of Purchaser by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Purchaser’s outside auditors and the audit committee of Purchaser’s Board of Directors
(i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Purchaser’s ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) to the knowledge of Purchaser, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who
have a significant role in Purchaser’s internal controls over financial reporting. To the knowledge of Purchaser, there is no reason to believe that
Purchaser’s outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(d) Since January 1, 2016, (i) neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of Purchaser, any director, officer, auditor,
accountant or representative of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or written claim, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to
loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls,
including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or written claim that Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting
or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Purchaser or any of its
officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Purchaser or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of Purchaser, to any
director or officer of Purchaser.

generally, and, during such period, each of Purchaser and the Company shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other
party all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably request. Each party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with the other party’s regular business operations during any such access. Neither Purchaser nor the
Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
violate or prejudice the rights of Purchaser’s or the Company’s, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution
in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement. The parties hereto will use reasonable best efforts to cooperate and make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) Each of Purchaser and the Company shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such party’s
Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the

extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated April 30, 2018, between Purchaser and the Company
(the “Confidentiality Agreement”).

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations.

6.3. Shareholders’ Approval.

(a) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable law and the Company Articles and Company Bylaws, call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the “Company Meeting,”) as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of
obtaining the Requisite Company Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other
matters of the type customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders to approve a merger. The Company shall engage a proxy
solicitor reasonably acceptable to Purchaser to assist in the solicitation of proxies from the common shareholders of the Company related to the
Requisite Company Vote. The Board of Directors of the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of the Company
the Requisite Company Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement) that they approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. However, subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.2, if the Board of
Directors of the Company, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in
good faith that it would more likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement,
then in submitting this Agreement to its shareholders, the Board of Directors of the Company may submit this Agreement to its shareholders without
recommendation or may change its recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or
amended), in which event the Board of Directors of the Company may communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation or a change in its
recommendation to its shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law; provided,
that the Board of Directors of the Company may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives the Purchaser at least five (5) business days’
prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take
such action (including, in the event such action is taken by the Board of Directors of the Company in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest
material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the third party making, any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof,
or describing in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company
takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the Purchaser and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel
and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless more likely than not result in a violation
of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be
deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3(a) and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3(a).

(b) The Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting, if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there
are insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary
to obtain the Requisite Company Vote and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company shall continue to use all reasonable best
efforts, together with a proxy solicitor, to solicit the holders of the Company Common Stock to obtain the Requisite Company Vote. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary

herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be submitted to the shareholders of the Company at the Company Meeting for the purpose
of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to inform the Purchaser of the status of proxy voting
for the Company Meeting on a prompt and continuous basis.

6.4. Legal Conditions to Merger. Subject in all respects to Section 6.1 of this Agreement, each of Purchaser and the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal and regulatory requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and the
Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
Governmental Entity and any other third party that is required to be obtained by the Company or Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5. Stock Exchange Listing. Purchaser shall cause the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for
listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

6.6. Employee Benefit Plans. (a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall provide the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
immediately following the Effective Time (the “Continuing Employees”) with a base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, that is no less favorable
than the base salary or base wage rate, as applicable, provided by the Company or any such Subsidiary to such Continuing Employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time, unless the Continuing Employee chooses to accept a position with the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries that is not substantially similar
to the job function for which such Continuing Employee was employed by the Company prior to the Closing, short- and long-term incentive
compensation opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than the short- and long-term incentive compensation opportunities provided to
similarly situated employees of Purchaser, and other compensation and employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the other
compensation and employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser. Without limiting the immediately preceding sentence,
Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries shall, provide to each Continuing Employee whose employment terminates during the period between the Closing
Date and December 31 of the year following the year in which the Closing Date occurs with severance benefits equal to the greater of (A) the severance
benefits for which such Continuing Employee was eligible immediately prior to the Closing and (B) the severance benefits for which employees of the
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries who are similarly situated to such Continuing Employee would be eligible under the severance plans or policies of
Purchaser or its Affiliates, in each case, determined without taking into account any reduction after the Closing in compensation paid to such Continuing
Employee.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees become eligible to
participate on or after the Effective Time (the “New Plans”), Purchaser shall: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the extent such pre-existing
conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such employee and his or her
eligible dependents with credit for any eligible expenses incurred by such employee or dependent prior to the Effective Time under a Company Benefit
Plan that is a medical plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in
satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements under any New Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such employees
with the Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New

Plan to the same extent that such service was taken into account under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time, provided, that
the foregoing service recognition shall not apply to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services.

(c) Purchaser shall assume and honor all Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms. Purchaser hereby acknowledges that a
“change in control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Benefit Plans will occur at the Effective Time.

(d) If requested by Purchaser prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary
to terminate the 401(k) plan of the Company, effective as of the Closing Date.

(e) (i) The Company may establish a cash-based retention program in the aggregate amount set forth on Section 6.6(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule to promote retention and to incentivize efforts to consummate the Closing (the “Closing Date Retention Program”) with any such
payments from such Closing Date Retention Program to be paid immediately prior the Effective Time or upon an earlier qualifying termination of
employment. Amounts under the Closing Date Retention Program shall be allocated among the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
identified, and in the amounts and on the terms determined, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (or his designees), subject to the approval of
Purchaser which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If a retention award or portion thereof under the Closing Date Retention Program is forfeited by a
participant, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (or his designees) may reallocate the retention award (or unpaid portion thereof) to existing
employees or new hires of the Company and its Subsidiaries, subject to the approval of Purchaser which shall not be unreasonbly withheld.

(ii) The Company may establish a cash-based retention program to promote retention and incentivize efforts through the Company Bank
conversion date (the “Conversion Date Retention Program”). Participants and amounts under the Conversion Date Retention Program shall be as
mutually agreed between Purchaser and the Company.

(f) Purchaser shall honor the bonus plans or arrangements in place for Continuing Employees for the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs.
To the extent that the Closing occurs prior to the payment of bonuses in respect of any fiscal year of the Company, Purchaser will pay the annual
bonuses to Continuing Employees in respect of such fiscal year in the ordinary course and based on actual performance through the end of the fiscal
year (with any subjective performance criteria deemed achieved at 100% of target levels) (the “Closing Fiscal Year Bonus Amount”), subject to the
Continuing Employee’s continued employment with Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries through the bonus payment date; provided, that (i) if a
Continuing Employee is terminated without cause following the end of the fiscal year but prior to the bonus payment date, the employee shall be entitled
to receive the Closing Fiscal Year Bonus Amount, payable on the employee’s termination date and (ii) if an employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries
is terminated immediately prior to the Closing Date or a Continuing Employee is terminated prior to the end of the fiscal year in which the Closing
occurs, then the employee will be entitled to receive the annual bonus, prorated through the employee’s termination date, based on actual performance
through the employee’s termination date (with any subjective performance criteria deemed achieved at 100% of target levels), payable on the
employee’s termination date. Any bonus payable pursuant to this Section 6.6(f) shall be payable in full in cash, including with respect to any portion of
the bonus that would otherwise be payable in equity-based awards.

(g) The Company may take such actions during the 2018 calendar year to the extent reasonably necessary in order to mitigate the impact of
Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code on the Company and employees of the Company, respectively, including, but not limited to, accelerating all or a
portion of the bonus for the 2018 fiscal year to a date no later than December 31, 2018 and accelerating the vesting and settlement of Company Stock
Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company RSUs to a date no later than December 31, 2018, subject to Purchaser’s approval which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(h) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of Purchaser, the Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Purchaser, the Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee,
officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the
Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the final sentence of Section 9.11, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any person, including any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

6.7. Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the Company Articles or Company Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement or any agreements providing for
indemnification by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each present and former director, officer or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the “Company Indemnified Parties”) against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out
of, or pertaining to, the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at
the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person and pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the consideration and approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred
by such Company Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company Articles or Company Bylaws as in effect on the date
of this Agreement or any agreements providing for indemnification by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that the Company Indemnified
Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, in a reasonable and customary form, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained, at no
expense to the beneficiaries, in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided, that
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims against the present and former officers
and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, that Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual
basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the “Premium Cap”),
and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which, in Purchaser’s and the Surviving Corporation’s good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage
available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six-year
“tail” policy under the Company’s existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding
sentence if and to the extent that the same may

be obtained for an amount that, on an annual basis, does not exceed the Premium Cap. If the Company purchases such a “tail policy,” Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain such “tail policy” in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

(c) The obligations of the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Company under this Section 6.7(c) shall not be terminated or
modified after the Effective Time in a manner so as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party or any other person entitled to the benefit of this
Section 6.7(c) without the prior written consent of the affected Company Indemnified Party or affected person. The rights of each Company Indemnified
Party under this Section 6.7 shall be in addition to any rights such person may have under the CBCA, any other applicable law or agreement.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. If Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns will consolidate with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all
or substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in any similar transaction, then in each case, Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation will cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

6.8. Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of
any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by the other party.

6.9. Advice of Changes. Each of Purchaser and the Company shall promptly advise the other party of any fact, change, event or
circumstance known to it (i) that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it or
(ii) which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in ARTICLE VII;
provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this
Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the
party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 to be satisfied.

6.10. Dividends. After the date of this Agreement, each of Purchaser and the Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any
dividends in respect of the Purchaser Common Stock and the Company Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being
the intention of the parties hereto that holders of the Company Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any
quarter with respect to their shares of Company Common Stock and any shares of Purchaser Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange
therefor in the Merger.

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall cause the number of directors that will comprise the full Board of Directors of
Purchaser at the Effective Time to be increased by one and to appoint Steven Bangert to the Board of Directors of Purchaser, or if Mr. Bangert is not

Company mutually agreed by the Company and Purchaser, to fill the vacancy resulting from such increase (Mr. Bangert, or such mutually agreed
person, the “Company Director”). Purchaser shall cause the Company

(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser (as the sole stockholder of Purchaser Bank) shall cause the number of directors that will
comprise the full Board of Directors of Purchaser Bank at the Effective Time to be increased by one and to appoint Steven Bangert, or if Mr. Bangert is
not then a member of the Board of Directors of the Company or otherwise unable to be appointed, such other member of the Board of Directors of the
Company mutually agreed by the Company and Purchaser, to the Board of Directors of Purchaser Bank to fill the vacancy resulting from such increase.

6.12. Acquisition Proposals.

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors,
agents, advisors and representatives (collectively, “Representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions with, any person
relating to any Acquisition Proposal; provided, that, prior to the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger) by the shareholders of the Company by the Requisite Company Vote, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal, after the date of this Agreement and its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is more likely than not to result in a
Superior Proposal, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that failure to take such actions would more
likely than not result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, further, that, prior to providing any nonpublic information
permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the Company shall have provided such information to Purchaser and entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such third party on material terms no less favorable to it than the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company will, and will
use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
conducted before the date of this Agreement with any person other than Purchaser with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company will
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Purchaser following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof (including the material terms and conditions of and the identity of
the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal), and will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Purchaser of any
related developments, discussions and negotiations, including any amendments to or revisions of the material terms of such inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law and the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company,
to enforce any existing confidentiality, standstill or similar agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party relating to an Acquisition Proposal
in accordance with its terms. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable law, to, within ten (10) business days after the date
hereof, request and confirm the return or destruction of any confidential information provided to any person (other than Purchaser and its affiliates)
pursuant to any such confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement. Unless and until this Agreement shall have been duly terminated in accordance with
its terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any binding acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or other definitive transaction agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with Section 6.12(a)) relating
to any Acquisition Proposal.

proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of

more of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more

individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company, or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company or its Subsidiaries
whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company, except, in each case, any sale of whole
loans and securitizations in the ordinary course of business and any bona fide internal reorganizations. “Superior Proposal” shall mean a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith to be more favorable to its shareholders than the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who shall be a nationally recognized
investment banking firm), (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii) after
taking into account all legal (with the advice of outside counsel), financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal (including any expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to closing) and any other relevant factors permitted under
applicable law; provided, that for purposes of the definition of “Superior Proposal,” the references to “25%” in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be references to “a majority.”

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2
under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any legally required disclosure to
the Company’s shareholders; provided, that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would
otherwise have under this Agreement.

6.13. Public Announcements. Each of the Company and Purchaser shall each use their reasonable best efforts to develop a joint
communications plan, to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consistent with such joint communications plan, and except in respect of any announcement required by applicable law or regulation, a request by a
Governmental Entity or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other and to
obtain the advance approval of the other party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press
release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.14. Change of Method. Purchaser shall be empowered at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change the method or structure of
effecting the combination of the Company and Purchaser (including the provisions of ARTICLE I hereof); provided, that no such change shall (i) alter
or change the Merger Consideration or the number of shares of the Purchaser Common Stock to be received by the Company’s shareholders in exchange
for each share of the Company Common Stock, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Company’s or Purchaser’s shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement, (iii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Company or Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement or (iv) materially impede or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties agree to reflect any such change in an appropriate amendment to this
Agreement executed by both parties in accordance with Section 9.2.

6.15. Takeover Statutes. None of the Company, Purchaser or Merger Sub or their respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that
would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each
shall take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the members of their

6.16. Exemption from Liability under Section 16(b). The Company and Purchaser agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and
retain those officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the “Company Insiders”),
both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity
Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.16. The Board of Directors of Purchaser
and of the Company, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act),
shall reasonably promptly, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be required to cause (in the case of the Company) any
dispositions of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards by the Company Insiders, and (in the case of Purchaser) any acquisitions of
Purchaser Common Stock by any Company Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of Purchaser subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt
from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

6.17. Litigation and Claims. Each of Purchaser and the Company shall promptly notify each other in writing of any action, arbitration,
investigation, litigation, or subpoena issued or commenced by or before, or otherwise involving, any Governmental Entity or arbitrator pending or, to the
knowledge of Purchaser or the Company, as applicable, threatened against Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries that
(a) questions or would reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any
actions taken or to be taken by Purchaser, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries with respect hereto or thereto, or (b) seeks to enjoin, materially
delay or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Company shall give Purchaser the opportunity to participate, at
Purchaser’s own expense, in the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or affiliates relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed without Purchaser’s prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

6.18. Bank Merger. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Purchaser, including by
causing Company Bank to execute, if requested by Purchaser, such certificates or articles of merger and such other documents and certificates as are
necessary, to effect, immediately following the Effective Time or at such later time as Purchaser may determine in its sole discretion, the Bank Merger
pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger in form and substance customary for mergers similar to the Bank Merger.

6.19. No Control of Other Party’s Business. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Purchaser or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly,
the right to control or direct the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, each of Purchaser and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations.

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of this
Agreement by the shareholders of the Company:

(a) by mutual consent of Purchaser and the Company in a written instrument;

(b) by either Purchaser or the Company if any Governmental Entity that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of
the Merger or the Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued a final nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank
Merger, unless the failure to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(c) by either Purchaser or the Company if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this
Agreement (the “Termination Date”), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate
this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(d) by either Purchaser or the Company (provided, that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or
warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a
termination by Purchaser, or Purchaser or Merger Sub, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach or failure to be true, either
individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if
occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by Purchaser, or 7.3, in the
case of a termination by the Company, and which is not cured within the earlier of the Termination Date and forty-five (45) days following written
notice to the Company, in the case of a termination by Purchaser, or Purchaser, in the case of a termination by the Company, or by its nature or timing
cannot be cured during such period;

(e) by Purchaser, if (i) prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Company or the Board of Directors of the
Company (A) submits this Agreement to its shareholders without a recommendation for approval, or otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely
modifies (or publicly discloses its intention to withdraw or materially and adversely modify) its recommendation as contemplated by Section 6.3, or
recommends to its shareholders an Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, or (B) shall have breached Section 6.3 by failing to call and hold the
Company Meeting, as provided therein, or materially breached Section 6.12; or (ii) a tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of the outstanding
shares of the Company Common Stock is commenced (other than by Purchaser or a Subsidiary thereof), and the Board of Directors of the Company
recommends that the shareholders of the Company tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such
shareholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within the ten (10) business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act; or

(f) by the Company, at any time within two Business Days following the Determination Date (defined below) if both of the following
conditions are satisfied:

(i) The number obtained by dividing the Average Closing Price by the Starting Price (each as defined below) (the “Purchaser Stock Ratio”)
shall be less than 0.825; and

(ii) (x) the Purchaser Stock Ratio shall be less than (y) the number obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the Index Price on the
Starting Date (each as defined below) and subtracting 0.175 from the quotient in this clause (ii)(y); subject, however, to the following three sentences. If
the Company elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this Section 8.1(f), it shall give written notice to Purchaser on or prior to the second
trading day prior to the Closing Date. Following its receipt of such notice, Purchaser shall have the option, at its sole discretion, to increase the stock
consideration to be received by the Company shareholders hereunder, by adjusting the Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth) to a
number (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth) equal to the quotient of (A) the product of (i) the product of the Starting Price, multiplied by 0.825,
multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, divided by (B) the Average Closing Price. If Purchaser so elects, it shall give prompt written notice to the
Company of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) and this
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified).

For purposes of this Section 8.1(f), the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

“Average Closing Price” shall mean the average of the daily volume-weighted average sales price per share of Purchaser Common Stock on the Nasdaq,
for the twenty consecutive full trading days ending on and including the third trading day preceding the Closing Date, as reported by Bloomberg.

“Determination Date” shall mean the third trading day prior to the Closing Date.

“Final Index Price” shall mean the average of the Index Prices for the 20 consecutive full trading days ending on and including the Determination
Date.

“Index Group” shall mean the NASDAQ Bank Index.

“Index Price” shall mean the closing price of the Index Group on a given date.

“Index Price on the Starting Date” shall mean $4,289.05.

“Starting Price” shall mean $101.91.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c), (d), (e) or (f) of this Section 8.1 shall give written notice of such termination
to the other party in accordance with Section 9.5, specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is effected.

8.2. Effect of Termination. (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Purchaser or the Company as provided in Section 8.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Purchaser, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the
officers, directors, employees, shareholders, agents or representatives of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(b), this Section 8.2, ARTICLE IX and the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Purchaser or
Merger Sub nor the Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or Willful Breach of any provision of
this Agreement occurring prior to termination (which, in the case of the Company, shall include the loss to the holders of the Company Common Stock
and Company Equity Awards of the economic benefits of the Merger, including the loss of the premium offered to the holders of the Company Common
Stock and Company Equity Awards). “Willful Breach” shall mean a material breach of, or material failure to perform any of the covenants or other
agreements contained in, this Agreement, that is a consequence of an act or failure to act by the breaching or non-performing party with actual
knowledge that such party’s act or failure to act would, or would be reasonably expected to, result in or constitute a breach of or failure of performance
under this Agreement.

(b) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made known to senior management of the Company or has been made directly to its shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly
announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company and (A) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either
Purchaser or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) without the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained at the Company Meeting or
(B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1(d) as a result of a Willful Breach of this Agreement, and (C) prior to
the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same Acquisition Proposal as referred to above), then the Company shall, on the earlier of the
date it enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Purchaser, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee
equal to $34,200,000 (the “Termination Fee”); provided, that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
to “25%” shall instead refer to “50%”.

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1(e), then the Company shall pay Purchaser, by wire
transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee within two (2) business days of the date of termination.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but without limiting the right of any party to recover liabilities or damages, the
maximum aggregate amount of fees, liabilities or damages payable by the Company under this Section 8.2 shall be equal to the Termination Fee. In no
event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Purchaser and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails
promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.2(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Purchaser commences a suit which results in a
judgment against the Company, for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay the costs and expenses of Purchaser (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if the Company fails to pay any amount due pursuant to
Section 8.2(b), then the Company shall pay interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was
originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the “prime rate” (as
announced by JPMorgan Chase & Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was required to be made, for the period
commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.2(b) constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and except in the case of fraud or Willful Breach shall be the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy of Purchaser in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in such section under circumstances where the Termination Fee
is payable and paid in full.

by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 6.7, which is intended to benefit each
Company Indemnified Party and his or her representatives, and subject to the right of the Company to enforce the rights of its shareholders and the
holders of Company Equity Awards pursuant to Section 8.2(a), this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not
intended to, and does not, confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance herewith without notice or liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts
or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

9.12. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof (including the parties’ obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and
(b) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

9.13. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as
to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other
provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such that
the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable, so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.

9.14. Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission. This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection
with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail
delivery of a “.pdf” format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have
the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument
shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a “.pdf” format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment
hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail
delivery of a “.pdf” format data file as a defense to the formation of a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

9.15. Employment and Non-Compete Agreement. Contemporaneous with the signing of this Agreement, Mr. Bangert has entered into an
employment agreement which contains provisions respecting his agreement not to compete with the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (the “Employment
and Non-Compete Agreement”). Purchaser has advised the Company that Purchaser ascribed significant value to the Employment and Non-Compete
Agreement.

ANNEX B-1

VOTING AGREEMENT

VOTING AGREEMENT, dated as of June 17, 2018 (this “Agreement”), by and between BOK Financial Corporation, an Oklahoma corporation
(“Purchaser”) and Steven Bangert (the “Shareholder”).

WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, CoBiz Financial Inc., a Colorado corporation (the “Company”), Purchaser and BOKF Merger Corporation

of Merger (as it may be amended or modified from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into
Merger Sub on the terms and conditions set forth therein, with Merger Sub surviving such merger (the “Merger”) and, in connection therewith, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (with certain exceptions) will be converted into the right to receive (i) a number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio and (ii) $5.70 in cash, as set forth in the Merger Agreement;

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Shareholder is the record or beneficial owner of, and has the right to vote and dispose of, certain shares of
Company Common Stock (such Company Common Stock, together with any other capital stock of the Company acquired by the Shareholder after the
date hereof, whether acquired directly or indirectly, upon the exercise of options, conversion of convertible securities, upon a stock dividend or
distribution, upon a split-up, reverse stock split, recapitalization, combination, reclassification or otherwise, and any other securities issued by the
Company that are entitled to vote on the approval of the Merger Agreement held or acquired by the Shareholder and which the Shareholder has the right
to vote and dispose of, being collectively referred to herein as the “Shares”);

WHEREAS, obtaining the approval of the Merger Agreement by the Requisite Company Vote of the Company shareholders is a condition to the
consummation of the Merger; and

WHEREAS, as an inducement to Purchaser to enter into the Merger Agreement and incur the obligations therein, Purchaser has required that the
Shareholder enter into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Section 1. Agreement to Vote; Restrictions on Voting and Dispositions.

(a) Agreement to Vote Company Common Stock. The Shareholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that from the date hereof
until the Expiration Time, at any meeting (whether annual or special and each adjourned or postponed meeting) of the Company’s shareholders, however
called, or in connection with any written consent of the Company’s shareholders, the Shareholder will (x) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause all
of the Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum and (y) vote or cause to be voted (including by written consent, if
applicable) all of the Shares, (1) in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including any proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting of the Company’s shareholders (which is not opposed by Purchaser) to a later date if there
are not sufficient votes to approve the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on the date on which such
meeting is held, (2) against any other Acquisition Proposal and (3) against any other action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the Merger.

directly or indirectly, sell (including short sales), transfer, give, pledge, grant a security interest in, encumber, assign, grant any option for the sale of,

operation of law) any Shares (collectively, “Transfer”), or enter into any agreement, arrangement or undertaking with respect to any Transfer of any
Shares, other than to any affiliate; provided that as a condition to such Transfer, such affiliate shall agree in a signed writing reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser to be bound by and comply with all the provisions of this Agreement. Any Transfer in violation of this Agreement shall be void.

(c) Transfer of Voting Rights. The Shareholder hereby agrees that prior to the Expiration Date the Shareholder shall not deposit any Shares
in a voting trust, grant any proxy or power of attorney or enter into any voting agreement or arrangement in contravention of the obligations of the
Shareholder under this Agreement with respect to any of the Shares.

(d) Inconsistent Agreements. The Shareholder hereby agrees that it shall not enter into any agreement, contract or arrangement with any
person prior to the Expiration Time, directly or indirectly, to vote, grant a proxy or power of attorney or give instructions with respect to the voting of
the Shares in any manner which is inconsistent with this Agreement.

Section 2. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Shareholder.

(a) Representations and Warranties. The Shareholder represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

(i) Capacity. The Shareholder has all requisite capacity, power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this
Agreement. No filing with, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, a Governmental Entity is necessary on the part of the Shareholder for
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Shareholder or the consummation by the Shareholder of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except where the failure to make or obtain such filing, permit, authorization, consent or approval would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to impair the Shareholder’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect.

(ii) Due Authorization. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and, if the Shareholder is not a
natural person, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Shareholder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Shareholder.

(iii) Binding Agreement. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser, this Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Shareholder, enforceable against the Shareholder in accordance with its terms (except to the extent
that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors’ rights generally or by general principles of equity).

(iv) Non-Contravention. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, the Shareholder has not (a) entered into any voting agreement
or voting trust with respect to any Shares or entered into any other contract relating to the voting of the Shares or (b) appointed or granted a proxy or
power of attorney with respect to any Shares in any manner which is inconsistent with this Agreement. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Shareholder nor the consummation by the Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby or compliance by the Shareholder with
any of the provisions hereof shall (1) if the Shareholder is not a natural person, conflict with or violate any provision of the organizational documents of
the Shareholder, (2) result in any breach or violation of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property
or asset of the Shareholder pursuant to any contract to which the Shareholder is a party or by which the Shareholder or any property or asset of the
Shareholder is bound or affected, or (3) violate any law or judgment, order, injunction, ruling or decree of any Governmental Entity applicable to the
Shareholder or any of its properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (2) or (3) for violations, breaches or defaults that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, impair the Shareholder’s ability to perform its obligations hereunder on a timely basis.

Table of Contents

(v) Ownership of Shares. Except for restrictions in favor of Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, and except for such transfer
restrictions of general applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act and the “blue sky” laws of the various States of the United States, the
Shareholder is the sole record and beneficial owner of all of the Shares, in each case free and clear of Liens, and has the power to vote or direct the vote
with respect to the Shares. As used in this Agreement, the terms “beneficial owner,” “beneficially own” and “beneficial ownership” shall have the
meaning set forth in Rule 13d-3 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act; provided, that, for purposes of determining whether a person is a
beneficial owner of any Shares, a person shall be deemed to be the beneficial owner of any Shares which may be acquired by such person pursuant to
any contract, arrangement or understanding or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise (irrespective of
whether the right to acquire such Shares is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time, including the passage of time in excess of 60 days,
the satisfaction of any conditions, the occurrence of any event or any combination of the foregoing). No person has any contractual or other right or
obligation to purchase or otherwise acquire any of such Shares and the Shareholder has not assigned any rights associated with any Shares to any
person.

(vi) Absence of Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no legal proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Shareholder,
threatened against the Shareholder before or by any Governmental Entity, except, as would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the
aggregate, to impair the ability of the Shareholder to perform its obligations hereunder in any material respect.

(vii) Reliance. The Shareholder understands and acknowledges that Purchaser is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance
upon the Shareholder’s execution and delivery of this Agreement and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Shareholder
contained herein.

(b) Covenants. The Shareholder hereby further covenants and agrees as follows:

(i) The Shareholder hereby authorizes Purchaser and the Company to publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the S-4 filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and any other applicable filings under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, the Shareholder’s identity and ownership of the Shares
and the nature of the Shareholder’s obligations under this Agreement.

(ii) The Shareholder hereby waives and agrees not to exercise any appraisal or dissenter’s rights which may arise with respect to the
Shares in connection with Merger or under the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

(c) Until the Expiration Time, the Shareholder shall not, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representative not to, directly or
indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or
participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data or
have or participate in any discussion with, any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal, except to (A) seek to clarify and understand the terms and
conditions of any inquiry or proposal made by any person or (B) notify a person that has made or, to the knowledge of the Shareholder, is considering
making, an Acquisition Proposal, of the existence of the provisions of this Section 2(c), (iv) approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or
(v) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any binding acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or other definitive transaction agreement constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to result in, any Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by the terms of Section 6.12(a) of the Merger Agreement).

Section 3. Representations and Warranties of Purchaser.

(a) Capacity. Purchaser is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has all requisite capacity, power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement.

this Agreement by Purchaser and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of Purchaser.

(c) Binding Agreement. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Shareholder, this Agreement

enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors’ rights generally or by general principles of equity).

Section 4. Termination. Other than this Section 4, Section 2(b)(i) and Section 5, which shall survive any termination of this Agreement, this
Agreement and all obligations of the Shareholder hereunder will automatically terminate and cease to be of any further force and effect upon the earlier
of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms (such earlier time, the “Expiration Time”).

(e) Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any person, other than the parties

Table of Contents

(i) Entire Agreement. This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding among the parties relating to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, among the parties, with respect
to the subject matter hereof. The effectiveness of this Agreement shall be conditioned upon the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by the
parties thereto.

(j) Capacity as Shareholder. This Agreement shall apply to the Shareholder solely in its capacity as a shareholder of the Company, and it
shall not apply in any manner to the Shareholder in any capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or in any other capacity, and shall not
limit or affect any actions taken by the Shareholder in any such other capacity.

(k) Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or any
circumstance, is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, (i) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted
therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (ii) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability.

(l) Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 4, the parties hereto shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the Chosen
Courts (as defined below). Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (i) there is adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an order or injunction to prevent breaches and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 5(l) shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

(m) No Waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

(n) Governing Law. This Agreement and all actions (whether at law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware without regard to principles of conflicts of law.

(o) Submission to Jurisdiction. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action between the parties arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contained in or contemplated by this Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any appellate court
therefrom (or, only if such courts lack or decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware or another court sitting in the State of Delaware and any appellate courts therefrom) (the “Chosen Courts”), and with respect to any such
action (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action in the
Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party hereto and
(iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section 5(b).

(p) Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE

ANNEX B-2
VOTING AGREEMENT

VOTING AGREEMENT, dated as of June 17, 2018 (this “Agreement”), by and between BOK Financial Corporation, an Oklahoma corporation
(“Purchaser”) and Noel N. Rothman (the “Shareholder”).

WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, CoBiz Financial Inc., a Colorado corporation (the “Company”), Purchaser and BOKF Merger Corporation
Number Sixteen, an Oklahoma corporation and a direct wholly-owned Subsidiary of Purchaser (“Merger Sub”) are entering into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (as it may be amended or modified from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into
Merger Sub on the terms and conditions set forth therein, with Merger Sub surviving such merger (the “Merger”) and, in connection therewith, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (with certain exceptions) will be converted into the right to receive (i) a number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio and (ii) $5.70 in cash, as set forth in the Merger Agreement;

WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Shareholder is the record or beneficial owner of, and has the right to vote and dispose of, certain shares of
Company Common Stock (such Company Common Stock, together with any other capital stock of the Company acquired by the Shareholder after the
date hereof, whether acquired directly or indirectly, upon the exercise of options, conversion of convertible securities, upon a stock dividend or
distribution, upon a split-up, reverse stock split, recapitalization, combination, reclassification or otherwise, and any other securities issued by the
Company that are entitled to vote on the approval of the Merger Agreement held or acquired by the Shareholder and which the Shareholder has the right
to vote and dispose of, being collectively referred to herein as the “Shares”);

WHEREAS, obtaining the approval of the Merger Agreement by the Requisite Company Vote of the Company shareholders is a condition to the
consummation of the Merger; and

WHEREAS, as an inducement to Purchaser to enter into the Merger Agreement and incur the obligations therein, Purchaser has required that the
Shareholder enter into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Section 1. Agreement to Vote; Restrictions on Voting and Dispositions.

(a) Agreement to Vote Company Common Stock. The Shareholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that from the date hereof
until the Expiration Time, at any meeting (whether annual or special and each adjourned or postponed meeting) of the Company’s shareholders, however
called, or in connection with any written consent of the Company’s shareholders, the Shareholder will (x) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause all
of the Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum and (y) vote or cause to be voted (including by written consent, if
applicable) all of the Shares, (1) in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including any proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting of the Company’s shareholders (which is not opposed by Purchaser) to a later date if there
are not sufficient votes to approve the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on the date on which such
meeting is held, (2) against any other Acquisition Proposal and (3) against any other action or agreement that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the Merger.

(b) Restrictions on Transfers. The Shareholder hereby agrees that, from the date hereof until the Expiration Time, the Shareholder shall not,
directly or indirectly, sell (including short sales), transfer, give, pledge, grant a security interest in, encumber, assign, grant any option for the sale of,

with respect to any Transfer of any Shares, other than to any affiliate; provided that as a condition to such Transfer, such affiliate shall agree in a signed
writing reasonably acceptable to Purchaser to be bound by and comply with all the provisions of this Agreement. Any Transfer in violation of this
Agreement shall be void.

(c) Transfer of Voting Rights. The Shareholder hereby agrees that prior to the Expiration Date the Shareholder shall not deposit any Shares
in a voting trust, grant any proxy or power of attorney or enter into any voting agreement or arrangement in contravention of the obligations of the
Shareholder under this Agreement with respect to any of the Shares.

(d) Inconsistent Agreements. The Shareholder hereby agrees that it shall not enter into any agreement, contract or arrangement with any
person prior to the Expiration Time, directly or indirectly, to vote, grant a proxy or power of attorney or give instructions with respect to the voting of
the Shares in any manner which is inconsistent with this Agreement.

Section 2. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Shareholder.

(a) Representations and Warranties. The Shareholder represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

(i) Capacity. The Shareholder has all requisite capacity, power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this
Agreement. No filing with, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, a Governmental Entity is necessary on the part of the Shareholder for
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Shareholder or the consummation by the Shareholder of the transactions contemplated
hereby, except where the failure to make or obtain such filing, permit, authorization, consent or approval would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to impair the Shareholder’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect.

(ii) Due Authorization. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and, if the Shareholder is not a
natural person, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Shareholder and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Shareholder.

(iii) Binding Agreement. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser, this Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the Shareholder, enforceable against the Shareholder in accordance with its terms (except to the extent
that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors’ rights generally or by general principles of equity).

(iv) Non-Contravention. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, the Shareholder has not (a) entered into any voting agreement
or voting trust with respect to any Shares or entered into any other contract relating to the voting of the Shares or (b) appointed or granted a proxy or
power of attorney with respect to any Shares in any manner which is inconsistent with this Agreement. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Shareholder nor the consummation by the Shareholder of the transactions contemplated hereby or compliance by the Shareholder with
any of the provisions hereof shall (1) if the Shareholder is not a natural person, conflict with or violate any provision of the organizational documents of
the Shareholder, (2) result in any breach or violation of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property
or asset of the Shareholder pursuant to any contract to which the Shareholder is a party or by which the Shareholder or any property or asset of the
Shareholder is bound or affected, or (3) violate any law or judgment, order, injunction, ruling or decree of any Governmental Entity applicable to the
Shareholder or any of its properties or assets, except in the case of clauses (2) or (3) for violations, breaches or defaults that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, impair the Shareholder’s ability to perform its obligations hereunder on a timely basis.

(v) Ownership of Shares. Except for restrictions in favor of Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, and except for such transfer
restrictions of general applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act and

the “blue sky” laws of the various States of the United States, the Shareholder is the sole record and beneficial owner of all of the Shares, in each case
free and clear of Liens, and has the power to vote or direct the vote with respect to the Shares. As used in this Agreement, the terms “beneficial owner,”
“beneficially own” and “beneficial ownership” shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 13d-3 promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act;
provided, that, for purposes of determining whether a person is a beneficial owner of any Shares, a person shall be deemed to be the beneficial owner of
any Shares which may be acquired by such person pursuant to any contract, arrangement or understanding or upon the exercise of conversion rights,
exchange rights, warrants or options, or otherwise (irrespective of whether the right to acquire such Shares is exercisable immediately or only after the
passage of time, including the passage of time in excess of 60 days, the satisfaction of any conditions, the occurrence of any event or any combination of
the foregoing). No person has any contractual or other right or obligation to purchase or otherwise acquire any of such Shares and the Shareholder has
not assigned any rights associated with any Shares to any person.

(vi) Absence of Litigation. As of the date hereof, there is no legal proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Shareholder,
threatened against the Shareholder before or by any Governmental Entity, except, as would not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the
aggregate, to impair the ability of the Shareholder to perform its obligations hereunder in any material respect.

(vii) Reliance. The Shareholder understands and acknowledges that Purchaser is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance
upon the Shareholder’s execution and delivery of this Agreement and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Shareholder
contained herein.

(b) Covenants. The Shareholder hereby further covenants and agrees as follows:

(i) The Shareholder hereby authorizes Purchaser and the Company to publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the S-4 filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement and any other applicable filings under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, the Shareholder’s identity and ownership of the Shares
and the nature of the Shareholder’s obligations under this Agreement.

(ii) The Shareholder hereby waives and agrees not to exercise any appraisal or dissenter’s rights which may arise with respect to the
Shares in connection with Merger or under the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

(c) Until the Expiration Time, the Shareholder shall not, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representative not to, directly or
indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or
participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data or
have or participate in any discussion with, any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal, except to (A) seek to clarify and understand the terms and
conditions of any inquiry or proposal made by any person or (B) notify a person that has made or, to the knowledge of the Shareholder, is considering
making, an Acquisition Proposal, of the existence of the provisions of this Section 2(c), (iv) approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or
(v) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into any binding acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or other definitive transaction agreement constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to result in, any Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by the terms of Section 6.12(a) of the Merger Agreement).

Section 3. Representations and Warranties of Purchaser.

(a) Capacity. Purchaser is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has all requisite capacity, power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement.

(b) Due Authorization. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by Purchaser and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the

(k) Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or any
circumstance, is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, (i) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted
therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (ii) the
remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability.

(l) Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties acknowledge and agree that prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 4, the parties hereto shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the Chosen
Courts (as defined below). Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (i) there is adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an order or injunction to prevent breaches and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 5(l) shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

(m) No Waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights.

(n) Governing Law. This Agreement and all actions (whether at law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware without regard to principles of conflicts of law.

(o) Submission to Jurisdiction. Each party hereto agrees that it shall bring any action between the parties arising out of or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contained in or contemplated by this Agreement exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any appellate court
therefrom (or, only if such courts lack or decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, in the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware or another court sitting in the State of Delaware and any appellate courts therefrom) (the “Chosen Courts”), and with respect to any such
action (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action in the
Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party hereto and
(iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section 5(b).

(p) Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH PARTY

subject to the first sentence of this subsection (2).

(3) The corporation shall make all dissenters, whether or not residents of this state, whose demands remain unresolved parties to the proceeding
commenced under subsection (2) of this section as in an action against their shares, and all parties shall be served with a copy of the petition. Service on
each dissenter shall be by registered or certified mail, to the address stated in such dissenter’s payment demand, or if no such address is stated in the

which the court finds the fair value of the dissenter’s shares, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by the corporation, or for the fair value, plus interest,
of the dissenter’s shares for which the corporation elected to withhold payment under section 7-113-208.

§ 7-113-302. Court Costs and Counsel Fees

(1) The court in an appraisal proceeding commenced under section 7-113-301 shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable

those services should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may award to said counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded
to the dissenters who were benefited.

evaluated the solvency or fair value of CoBiz Financial or Purchaser under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters. We have assumed, at the direction of CoBiz Financial, that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver,
modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and
other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or
amendments or modifications, will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on CoBiz Financial, Purchaser or the contemplated benefits of the
Merger. We have also assumed, at your direction, that the final executed Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement
reviewed by us.
