December 29, 2016

Dear Stockholder:

        You are cordially invited to attend the Special Meeting of Stockholders (the "special meeting") of Headwaters Incorporated ("Headwaters"), which will be held on Friday,
February 3, 2017, starting at 2:00 p.m., Mountain Standard Time, at our corporate headquarters located at 10701 South River Front Parkway, Suite 300, South Jordan, Utah
84095.

        On November 20, 2016, we entered into a merger agreement (the "merger agreement") with Boral Limited ("Boral") and Enterprise Merger Sub, Inc., an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Boral ("Merger Sub") providing for the acquisition of Headwaters by Boral. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and
into Headwaters, with Headwaters continuing as the surviving company and as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Boral (the "merger"). At the special meeting, we will ask
you to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, thereby approving the merger, and certain other matters as set forth in the Notice of Special Meeting of
Stockholders and Proxy Statement.

        If the merger is approved and completed, you will be entitled to receive $24.25 in cash, without interest, and the additional consideration, if any (as described in the
accompanying proxy statement), less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of Headwaters common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Headwaters common
stock") that you own.

        Adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Headwaters common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Our Board of Directors, after considering various factors, has determined that the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Headwaters and its stockholders, and
approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger.

        The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote:

(1) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger; 

(2) "FOR" the proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation arrangements disclosed in the accompanying proxy statement that
may be payable to Headwaters' named executive officers in connection with the completion of the merger; and 

(3) "FOR" the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate in the view of the Headwaters
Board of Directors, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement.

        The accompanying proxy statement provides you with detailed information about these proposals, including the merger agreement and the merger. A copy of the merger
agreement is included as Annex A to the proxy statement. You can also obtain other information about Headwaters from documents that we have filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The proxy statement also describes the actions and determinations of our Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement
and the merger. We urge you to read the entire proxy statement, including the annexes and any documents incorporated herein by reference, carefully.



8/31/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1003344/000104746916017319/a2230570zdefm14a.htm

        Your vote is important regardless of the number of shares you own. The merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Headwaters common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, approving the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger.

        Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, your vote is important and we encourage you to vote promptly. You may vote your shares via a toll-free telephone number or
over the Internet. You may also sign, date and mail the enclosed proxy card in the envelope provided. Instructions regarding the three methods of voting are contained in this
proxy statement or in the proxy card.

        Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved of the transactions described in this
document, including the merger, or determined if the information contained in this document is accurate or adequate. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal
offense.

        The accompanying proxy statement is dated December 29, 2016 and, together with the enclosed form of proxy card, is first being mailed to stockholders of Headwaters on
or about January 3, 2017.

  Sincerely,

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
TO BE HELD ON FEBRUARY 3, 2017

To the Stockholders of Headwaters Incorporated:

        Notice is hereby given that a Special Meeting of the Stockholders (the "special meeting") of Headwaters Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("Headwaters" or the
"company"), will be held on Friday, February 3, 2017 at 2:00 p.m., Mountain Standard Time, at our corporate headquarters located at 10701 South River Front Parkway,
Suite 300, South Jordan, Utah 84095, for the following purposes:

        1.     Adoption of the Merger Agreement.    To consider and vote upon a proposal (the "merger proposal") to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
November 20, 2016, as it may be amended from time to time (the "merger agreement"), by and among Headwaters, Boral Limited, an Australian corporation ("Boral"),
and Enterprise Merger Sub, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Boral ("Merger Sub"). The merger agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and
into Headwaters, with Headwaters continuing as the surviving company (the "merger") and the conversion of each share of Headwaters common stock (other than
"excluded shares"), into the right to receive $24.25 in cash and the additional consideration, if any (as described in the accompanying proxy statement), without interest
and less any applicable withholding taxes. By "excluded shares," we mean (i) shares owned by Headwaters as treasury stock and shares owned directly by Boral or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, (ii) shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Headwaters or Boral,
(iii) Headwaters restricted shares to be converted to cash and (iv) shares owned by stockholders who have properly exercised such stockholder's appraisal rights in respect
of such shares under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

        2.     Advisory Vote Regarding Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation.    To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve, by a non-binding
advisory vote, the compensation arrangements disclosed in the accompanying proxy statement that may be payable to Headwaters' named executive officers in connection
with the completion of the merger (the "merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal").

        3.     Adjournment of the Special Meeting.    To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting from time to time, if
necessary or appropriate in the view of the Headwaters Board of Directors, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to
adopt the merger agreement (the "adjournment proposal").

        Only stockholders of record of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Headwaters common stock" or "our common stock") at the close of business on
December 23, 2016 (the "record date") are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof.

        The adoption of the merger agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Headwaters common stock entitled to vote at the
special meeting is a condition to the completion of the merger. The approval of each of the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal and the adjournment
proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Headwaters common stock that are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on such
proposal.

        Even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, we request that you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card and thus ensure that your shares will be
represented at the special meeting if you are unable to attend. If you do attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you may withdraw your proxy at that time.

        If your shares of Headwaters common stock are held in street name through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to
vote in accordance with the voting instruction form furnished by your broker, bank or other nominee. If you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote,
the effect will be the same as a vote against the adoption of the merger agreement.

        YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. FAILURE TO VOTE YOUR SHARES WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS A VOTE "AGAINST" THE MERGER PROPOSAL. YOU
MAY VOTE BY MAIL, INTERNET OR TELEPHONE OR BY ATTENDING THE SPECIAL MEETING AND VOTING BY BALLOT, ALL AS DESCRIBED IN THE
ACCOMPANYING PROXY STATEMENT.

        The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote:

(2) "FOR" the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal; and 

(3) "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

        Only stockholders of record as of the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, and "street name" holders (those whose shares are held through a nominee) who bring
evidence of beneficial ownership on the record date for the special meeting, such as a copy of your account statement or similar evidence of ownership of our common stock as
of the record date for the special meeting, may attend the special meeting. If you are a "street name" holder and you wish to vote at the special meeting, you must also bring a
"legal proxy" from the record holder (your nominee) of the shares of our common stock authorizing you to vote at the special meeting. All stockholders should also bring photo
identification.

        The accompanying proxy statement provides a detailed description of the merger and the merger agreement. We urge you to read the accompanying proxy statement,
including the annexes and any documents incorporated by reference, carefully and in their entirety. If you have any questions concerning the merger or the accompanying proxy
statement, would like additional copies of the proxy statement or need help voting your shares of Headwaters common stock, please contact Headwaters' proxy solicitor:

entering into the merger agreement and completing the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions of
the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Headwaters, with Headwaters surviving the merger as an indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of Boral.

        Merger Sub's principal executive offices are located at 200 Mansell Court East #305, Roswell, Georgia 30076, and its telephone number is +770.645.4500.

The Merger (Page 72)

        On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which we refer
to as the DGCL, at the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into Headwaters. At the effective time of the merger, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub will cease and Headwaters will continue as the surviving company in the merger, which we sometimes refer to herein as the surviving company.

Expected Timing of the Merger (Page 72)

        Headwaters and Boral are working to complete the merger promptly, and we intend it to be completed in mid-calendar year 2017. The merger is subject, however, to various
regulatory approvals and other conditions to closing, which are described in more detail in this proxy statement, and it is possible that factors outside the control of either
company could result in the merger being completed at a later time, or not at all.

        We expect to complete the merger promptly following the receipt of all required regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions precedent
described in the merger agreement.

Effect on Headwaters if the Merger is Not Completed (Page 24)

        If the merger agreement is not adopted by Headwaters stockholders at the special meeting or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Headwaters stockholders
will not receive the merger consideration or any payment for their shares of Headwaters common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Headwaters will remain a public
company and Headwaters common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we
refer to as the Exchange Act, and Headwaters will continue to file

periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the "SEC" in this proxy statement. In certain circumstances, Headwaters may be
required to pay, or may be entitled to receive, a termination fee, may be required to reimburse Boral's expenses (subject to certain limitations), or may seek other remedies in
connection with a termination of the merger agreement, in each case, as described under "Terms of the Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination
Fees" and "Terms of the Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Effect of Termination" beginning on page 95 of this proxy statement.

Merger Consideration (Page 73)

        At the effective time of the merger, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such time (other than (i) shares owned by Headwaters as
treasury stock and shares owned directly by Boral or Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, (ii) shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Headwaters or Boral, (iii) Headwaters restricted shares to be converted to cash and (iv) shares owned by stockholders who have properly exercised their
stockholder's appraisal rights in respect of such shares under Section 262 of the DGCL, which we collectively refer to as excluded shares) will be converted into the right to
receive (x) $24.25 in cash, without interest, and (y) the additional consideration, if any (as described below), which we refer to herein together as the merger consideration. All
such shares of Headwaters common stock, when so converted, will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist. The right of any holder of
Headwaters common stock to receive the merger consideration will be subject to and reduced by the amount of any required withholding under applicable tax law.

        The additional consideration means, if the closing has not occurred by September 1, 2017, which we refer to as the regulatory approval trigger date, and the only conditions
to the obligations of Boral and Merger Sub to close that have not been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, which conditions
would be capable of being satisfied at the closing) are the conditions with respect to regulatory approvals and the absence of legal restraints (but only if the applicable legal
restraint is issued under or pursuant to any antitrust law or results from a failure to obtain clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which we refer
to as CFIUS, clearance) and Headwaters' breach (if any) of the merger agreement was not the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, the failure of such conditions to be
satisfied, an amount (rounded down to the nearest whole penny) in cash equal to the product of (i) each calendar month that elapses during the period commencing on the
regulatory approval trigger date and ending on the date immediately preceding the closing date and (ii) $0.09, pro rated (based on the number of days elapsed) for the month in
which the closing occurs to the extent the closing date is not the last day of the month.

        At or prior to the effective time of the merger, Boral will deposit or cause to be deposited with the paying agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration,
which we refer to as the payment fund.

Voting Agreement (Page 60 and Annex B)

        Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Kirk A. Benson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, entered into a voting agreement, which we refer to as
the voting agreement, with Boral, pursuant to which Mr. Benson, among other things, is required to vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of December 23,
2016, Mr. Benson is entitled to vote approximately 1,575,665 shares of our common stock, or approximately 2.1% of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to
vote.

The Special Meeting (Page 30)

Date, Time and Place (Page 30)

        The special meeting will be held on Friday, February 3, 2017, at 2 p.m., Mountain Standard Time, at 10701 South River Front Parkway, Suite 300, South Jordan, Utah
84095.

Purpose of the Special Meeting (Page 30)

        At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon:

(1) a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, which proposal we refer to as the "merger
proposal" in this proxy statement; 

(2) a proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation arrangements disclosed in this proxy statement that may be payable to Headwaters'
named executive officers in connection with the completion of the merger, which proposal we refer to as the "merger-related named executive officer
compensation proposal" in this proxy statement; and 

(3) a proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate in the view of the Board of Directors, to solicit
additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement, which proposal we refer to as the "adjournment
proposal" in this proxy statement.

Recommendations of Our Board of Directors (Page 30)

        After considering various reasons to approve the merger agreement, as well as certain countervailing factors, the Board of Directors unanimously determined the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, to be advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Headwaters and its stockholders, and
unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Certain factors considered by the Board of Directors
in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger can be found in the section titled "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Reasons for the
Merger" beginning on page 44 of this proxy statement.

        The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that Headwaters stockholders vote:

(1) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger; 

(2) "FOR" the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal; and 

(3) "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

Record Date and Voting Information (Page 31)

        Only stockholders who hold shares of our common stock at the close of business on December 23, 2016, which we refer to as the "record date" in this proxy statement, will
be entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each share of our common stock outstanding on the record date will be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to our
stockholders for approval at the special meeting. As of the record date for the special meeting, there were 74,883,657 outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at
the special meeting.

Table of Contents

Quorum (Page 31)

        The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of record of a majority of the shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting is
necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business at the special meeting.

Required Vote; Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes (Page 31)

        Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Headwaters common stock entitled to vote at the
special meeting. Approval of each of the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the shares of Headwaters common stock that are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal.

        Abstentions will have the same effect as votes "AGAINST" the merger proposal, the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal and the adjournment
proposal.

        Shares not in attendance will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal,
but will have the same effect as votes "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

        If you hold your shares through a nominee (as defined below) and fail to instruct your nominee on how you wish your shares of Headwaters common stock to be voted using
the voting instruction form provided by your nominee, then your shares will not be voted. The "broker non-votes" (as defined below), if any, will not be counted as votes either
"FOR" or "AGAINST" the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal, but will have the effect of a vote "AGAINST" the merger
proposal.

Voting by Stockholders (Page 32)

        Any Headwaters stockholder of record entitled to vote may submit a proxy by returning a signed proxy card by mail, through the internet or by telephone, or may vote in
person by appearing at the special meeting. If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of Headwaters common stock in "street name" through a broker, bank or other
nominee, which we refer to as a "nominee" in this proxy statement, you should instruct your nominee on how you wish your shares of Headwaters common stock to be voted
using the instructions provided by your nominee. The nominee cannot vote on these proposals. Therefore, it is important that you cast your vote or instruct your broker, bank or
nominee on how you wish your shares to be voted. If you are a street name holder and wish to vote the shares beneficially owned by you in person by ballot at the special
meeting, you must provide a "legal proxy" from your nominee, giving you the right to vote the shares at the special meeting.

Voting by Headwaters' Directors and Executive Officers as to the Merger Proposal (Page 33)

        At the close of business on December 23, 2016, the record date for the special meeting, our directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned, in the
aggregate, 2,044,276 shares of our common stock which they are entitled to vote at the special meeting, representing approximately 2.7% of the shares of our common stock
outstanding on the record date and entitled to vote at the special meeting.

Delisting and Deregistration of Our Common Stock (Page 57)

        Upon completion of the merger, we will remove our common stock from listing on the NYSE and price quotations in the public market will no longer be available for our
common stock, and the registration of our common stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated.

Recommendation of Our Board of Directors (Page 48)

        After considering various reasons to approve the merger agreement, as well as certain countervailing factors, the Board of Directors unanimously determined the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, to be advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Headwaters and its stockholders, and
unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Certain factors considered by the Board of Directors
in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger can be found in the section titled "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Reasons for the
Merger" beginning on page 44 of this proxy statement.

        The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the merger.

Opinion of Headwaters Financial Advisor (Page 48 and Annex C)

        At the November 19, 2016 meeting of the Board of Directors, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ("Deutsche Bank"), financial advisor to Headwaters, rendered its oral opinion to
the Board of Directors, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated November 20, 2016, to the effect that as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations, qualifications and conditions on the review undertaken in connection therewith, as described in
Deutsche Bank's opinion, the consideration of $24.25 in cash per share of Headwaters common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Headwaters
common stock (other than Boral and its affiliates). Deutsche Bank did not express any opinion with respect to the additional consideration, if any.

        The full text of Deutsche Bank's written opinion, dated November 20, 2016, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations, qualifications and conditions on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and is incorporated
herein by reference. The summary of Deutsche Bank's opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.
Deutsche Bank's opinion was addressed to, and for the use and benefit of, the Board of Directors in connection with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the merger.
Deutsche Bank's opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Headwaters common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any
related matter. Deutsche Bank's opinion was limited solely to the fairness of the consideration of $24.25 in cash per share of Headwaters common stock, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of outstanding Headwaters common stock (other than Boral and its affiliates), and Deutsche Bank did not express any opinion as
to the underlying decision by Headwaters to engage in the merger or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative transactions or business
strategies.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger (Page 57)

        In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that Headwaters stockholders vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, which we refer to as
the Board of Directors' "recommendation" in this proxy statement, you should be aware that Headwaters' directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be
different from, or in addition to, the interests of Headwaters' stockholders generally. Interests of directors and executive officers that may be different from or in addition to the
interests of Headwaters' stockholders include, but are not limited to:

• the merger agreement provides for the cash settlement of all outstanding Headwaters stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock
units, and amounts deferred under the Headwaters Director Deferred Compensation Plan, in each case whether vested or

unvested; the treatment of outstanding equity awards is described in more detail under "Summary Term Sheet—Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards"
beginning on page 11);

• Kirk Benson, our Chief Executive Officer, and our other executive officers are party to employment agreements and change of control agreements with
Headwaters that provide for severance benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment in connection with or following the merger. These
agreements are discussed in more detail in the section titled Proposal No. 2—Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation"
beginning on page 98; 

• continued indemnification rights and directors' and officers' liability insurance to be provided by the surviving company described below under "Terms of the
Merger Agreement—Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance" beginning on page 90.

        Certain of these interests are discussed in more detail in the sections titled "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Interests of Certain Persons in the
Merger" beginning on page 57 of this proxy statement. The members of the Board of Directors were aware of the different or additional interests set forth herein and considered
these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and overseeing the negotiation of the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending to the stockholders of
Headwaters that they adopt the merger agreement, and approve the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger.

Financing of the Merger (Page 57)

        The merger is not conditioned on Boral obtaining the proceeds of any financing. Boral currently expects to finance the merger by way of (i) its recently completed offer of
Boral equity securities which raised approximately AUD$2.05 billion, which we refer to as the offer, (ii) USD$0.8 billion of debt from a committed bridge acquisition facility
and (iii) existing cash on Boral's balance sheet.

        The offer included an institutional component and a retail component. As of the date of this proxy statement, the offer has been completed, and raised approximately
AUD$2.05 billion.

        Concurrently with the signing of the merger agreement, Boral also entered into a committed bridge acquisition facility agreement, which we refer to as the bridge facility
agreement, dated November 21, 2016 with Citibank N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., which we refer to as the bridge lenders. The ability of Boral to request the making of
loans from the bridge lenders under the bridge facility agreement is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of certain conditions set forth therein and the bridge facility agreement
contains representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default usual for a facility of this nature.

        We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be approximately
$2.5 billion. These funds include the funds needed to:

• pay our stockholders (including equity award holders) the amount due under the merger agreement; 

• refinance or repay certain of our outstanding indebtedness, including our existing senior secured loan and revolving credit facilities; and 

• pay customary fees and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Regulatory Matters (Page 61)

        Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, each party has agreed to prepare and file as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
applications, notices, filings and other documents and to use reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable, the required regulatory approvals in order to complete
the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. It is possible that the required regulatory approvals may not be obtained before stockholders
vote on the merger agreement. For further discussion of regulatory matters relating to the merger, see "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Regulatory
Matters" beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement.

        In particular, the merger is subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended, which we refer to as the HSR Act. The HSR Act provides for an initial 30 calendar day waiting period following the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's, which we refer
to as the FTC, and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice's, which we refer to as the Antitrust Division, receipt of both parties' Premerger Notification and
Report Forms before the parties may consummate the merger. Boral and Headwaters each filed its respective Premerger Notification and Report Form with the FTC and the
Antitrust Division. The initial waiting period applicable to the merger will expire at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on January 6, 2017, unless the waiting period is earlier terminated
by the FTC and the Antitrust Division or extended by the issuance of a request for additional information and documentary material, which we refer to as a second request, to
Boral and Headwaters by the FTC or the Antitrust Division prior to that time. If, before expiration or early termination of the initial 30 calendar day waiting period, either the
FTC or the Antitrust Division issues a second request, the waiting period with respect to the merger will be extended for an additional period of 30 calendar days following both
parties' substantial compliance with that request unless earlier terminated by the FTC or the Antitrust Division. After that time, the waiting period may be extended only by court
order or with the consent of the parties. At any time before or after the consummation of any such transactions, the FTC or the Antitrust Division could take such action under the
antitrust laws of the U.S. as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the merger. Private parties (including individual States) may also
bring legal actions under the antitrust laws of the U.S.

        The parties have also agreed to work cooperatively to file a joint voluntary notice with CFIUS. Upon the acceptance of such a notice, CFIUS will initiate a 30 calendar day
review period at the end of which, in the absence of any unresolved national security concerns, it will conclude all action under Section 721 of Title VII of the Defense
Production Act of 1950, as amended ("Section 721"). If CFIUS determines that additional review is required, it will commence a 45 calendar day investigation no later than the
end of the initial 30 day review period. If at the end of the investigation CFIUS has no unresolved national security concerns it will conclude all action under Section 721. At the
conclusion of such investigation, if CFIUS has unresolved national security concerns, it will send a report to the President who may act to suspend or prohibit the transaction. At
any time during the course of CFIUS review or investigation, CFIUS may request that the parties take actions to mitigate any national security concerns identified. Where CFIUS
has completed all action with respect to the transaction or the President has announced a decision not to exercise his authority under Section 721 with respect to the transaction,
then the parties may enjoy a "safe harbor" against further action by the President or CFIUS with respect to the transaction. The parties filed a draft notice with CFIUS on
December 16, 2016.

        Boral is required to make a notification filing under the ICA to the Investment Review Division of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. While this
filing can be made subsequent to the completion of a transaction, the parties have agreed that Boral will make the filing prior to the completion of the transaction. This will
ensure that the 45 day period during which the Governor in Counsel could elect to commence a national security review under Part IV.1 of the ICA will expire

prior to the completion of the transaction. In the event that a national security review is commenced under the ICA, and the Governor in Counsel determines that the transaction
could be injurious to Canadian national security the transaction could be suspended or prohibited. At any time during a possible national security review, the Governor in Counsel
may request that Boral take actions to mitigate any national security concerns identified. If Boral does not receive a notice or order under Part IV.1 of the ICA within 45 days of
the submission of a completed notification filing, or in the event such notice has been sent or order made and Boral subsequently receives (i) notice that no review will be made
with respect to the transaction, (ii) notice that no further action will be taken with respect to the merger or (iii) an order authorizing the transaction, the transaction can be
completed under the ICA.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 62)

        The exchange of shares of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes to U.S. holders (as
defined in the section titled "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 62 of this
proxy statement). If you are a U.S. holder and your shares of our common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the merger, you will generally recognize gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and your adjusted tax basis
in such shares. The exchange of shares of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will generally not result in a non-U.S. holder (as defined in the section titled
"Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement) being
subject to U.S. federal income tax unless the non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the U.S. You should read the section titled "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger
Agreement—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement for a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders. You should also consult with your tax advisor for a complete analysis of the particular tax
consequences of the merger to you, including the applicability and effect of any U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax laws.

Appraisal Rights (Page 65 and Annex D)

        Under Delaware law, you are entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger, in lieu of the merger consideration.

        If you comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, you will have the right under Delaware law to receive, in lieu of the per share merger consideration, the
fair value of your shares of Headwaters common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any
voluntary cash payments made by the surviving company pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL). The amount determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery to
be the fair value of Headwaters common stock as of the effective time of the merger could be more than, the same as or less than the merger consideration a stockholder would be
entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement. Your appraisal rights are subject to a number of restrictions and technical requirements (including relating to the
aggregate amount of shares of common stock owned by stockholders seeking appraisal). Generally, in order to perfect your appraisal rights, you must, among other things,
comply with the following procedures:

• prior to the vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting, you must deliver to Headwaters a written demand for appraisal of your shares that complies with
the applicable statutory requirements;

Table of Contents

• you must not vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, either by proxy or
in person, at the special meeting; 

• you must continue to hold your shares through the effective time of the merger; 

• if the merger is approved at the special meeting, you must not submit your shares for payment of the merger consideration; and 

• within 120 days of the effective time of the merger, you must file a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, requesting a determination of the
fair value of your shares of Headwaters common stock as of the effective time of the merger.

        Merely voting against the merger proposal will not perfect your appraisal rights. If you hold your shares in "street name," you must instruct your broker or other nominee to
take action in strict compliance with the DGCL to exercise your appraisal rights. Requirements under Delaware law for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail
under "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 65 of this proxy statement. The discussion of appraisal rights contained in
this proxy statement is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL
regarding appraisal rights available to stockholders of Delaware corporations in certain mergers and consolidations that is reproduced and attached as Annex D to this proxy
statement. If you wish to avail yourself of your appraisal rights, you should consult your legal advisor due to the complexity of the appraisal process. Your failure to follow
exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights.

No Solicitation (Page 81)

        From the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger or, if earlier, the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, Headwaters
has agreed not to, and to cause its subsidiaries not to, and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective representatives not to on behalf of the company,
directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, facilitate or induce any inquiry or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
any alternative proposal (as defined below in the section titled "Terms of the Merger Agreement—Additional Agreements—No Solicitation" beginning on page 81
of this proxy statement); 

• furnish information to or afford access to the business, employees, officers, contracts, properties, assets, books or records of Headwaters and its subsidiaries to any
person that could reasonably be expected to lead to, or in connection with, an inquiry or an alternative proposal; 

• enter into, continue or maintain discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to an inquiry or an alternative proposal; 

• participate in or knowingly facilitate any discussions or negotiations (other than informing persons of the non-solicitation provisions set forth in the merger
agreement, solely in response to a bona fide unsolicited inquiry after the date of the merger agreement) regarding, or furnish or cause to be furnished to any person
or "group" (as such term is defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) any information with respect to Headwaters, or take any other action to facilitate any
inquiry; 

• approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend any alternative proposal; 

• submit to a vote of its stockholders, approve, endorse or recommend any alternative proposal; 

• grant any waiver, amendment or release under any state anti-takeover statute; 

• grant any waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or standstill agreement or provisions of similar effect to which it is a party or of which it is a
beneficiary (and Headwaters will enforce any such provisions, except that Headwaters will not be required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive, any
provision that prohibits or purports to prohibit a proposal being made to the Board of Directors on a confidential basis to the extent that the Board of Directors
determines, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with Headwaters' outside legal

counsel), that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable law);

• effect any adverse recommendation change (as described below); or 

• enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or any agreement providing for any alternative proposal (except for permitted confidentiality agreements,
as described below).

        However, if Headwaters or any of its subsidiaries or any of its or their respective representatives receives a written alternative proposal that was unsolicited after the date of
the merger agreement by any person or "group" at any time prior to obtaining the stockholder approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement that did not result from or
arise in connection with a breach of the non-solicit provisions of the merger agreement, Headwaters and its representatives may, prior to (but not after) obtaining stockholder
approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, take the actions set forth in the two bullets below if the Board of Directors has determined in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with Headwaters' financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that such alternative proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior
proposal, as described below in the section titled "Terms of the Merger Agreement—Additional Agreements—No Solicitation" beginning on page 81 of this proxy statement, and
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable law:

• obtain from such person or "group" an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive in all material respects with respect to such
person or "group" as the terms of the confidentiality agreement entered into by Headwaters and Boral, dated August 18, 2016, which we refer to herein as the
confidentiality agreement (which confidentiality agreement will include a standstill agreement but may permit submission of non-public, private proposals to the
Board of Directors); and 

• following the entry into such confidentiality agreement, furnish information to such person or "group," enter into discussions and negotiations with such person or
"group" with respect to such alternative proposal and afford access to the business, employees, officers, contracts, properties, assets, books and records of
Headwaters and its subsidiaries in response to such alternative proposal.

Change of Board of Directors' Recommendation (Page 83)

        The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that the holders of Headwaters shares vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, approving the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.

        At any time prior to obtaining the stockholder approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, the Board of Directors may (i) solely upon the occurrence of an
intervening event, as defined below in the section titled "Terms of the Merger Agreement—Additional Agreements—Change of Recommendation" beginning on page 83 of this
proxy statement, or in the event that Headwaters has received a superior proposal (after taking into account the terms of any revised offer by Boral, as described below),
withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Boral, the Board of Directors' recommendation in favor of voting for the
adoption of the merger agreement, or take any action, or make any public statement, filing or release inconsistent with such recommendation (we refer to any of the foregoing as
an adverse recommendation change) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, recommending against the merger or approving, endorsing or recommending any alternative
proposal) and (ii) if Headwaters has received a superior proposal (after taking into account the terms of any revised offer by Boral, as described below), terminate the merger
agreement to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for such superior proposal simultaneously with the termination of the merger agreement, in the case of

clauses (i) and (ii), if the Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the merger agreement provides that the Board of Directors may not make an adverse recommendation change in response to a superior
proposal, or terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal, unless:

• Headwaters has complied in all material respects with the restrictions described in "Terms of the Merger Agreement—Additional Agreements—No Solicitation"
and in "Terms of the Merger Agreement—Additional Agreements—Change of Recommendation"; 

• Headwaters has provided prior written notice to Boral at least three business days in advance, which we refer to herein as the notice period, of taking such action,
which notice will advise Boral that the Board of Directors has received a superior proposal and will include a copy of such superior proposal and all other material
transaction agreements and other material documents relating to such superior proposal (or, where no such copy is available, a description of the material terms
and conditions of such superior proposal); 

• during the notice period, Headwaters has and has caused its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to negotiate with Boral in good faith (to the extent Boral
desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that such superior proposal ceases to constitute (in the
judgment of the Board of Directors after consultation with Headwaters' financial advisors and outside legal counsel) a superior proposal; and 

• the Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or
modifications made or agreed to by Boral, if any, and after consultation with Headwaters' financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such superior proposal
remains a superior proposal.

        If during the notice period any revisions are made to the superior proposal, Headwaters must deliver a new written notice to Boral and must comply with the requirements
described above with respect to such new written notice; however, for purposes of this sentence, references to the three business day notice period above shall be deemed to be
references to a two business day notice period.

        In addition to the foregoing, the Board of Directors may not make an adverse recommendation change in response to an intervening event unless:

• Headwaters has complied in all material respects with the restrictions described in "Terms of the Merger Agreement—Additional Agreements—No Solicitation"
and in "Terms of the Merger Agreement—Additional Agreements—Change of Recommendation"; 

• Headwaters has provided prior written notice to Boral at least three business days, referred to herein as the notice period, in advance of taking such action, which
notice will advise Boral of the circumstances giving rise to the adverse recommendation change; 

• during the notice period, Headwaters has and has caused its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to negotiate with Boral in good faith (to the extent Boral
desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that the failure to make such adverse recommendation
change (in the judgment of the Board of Directors after consultation with Headwaters' financial advisors and outside legal counsel) would no longer be
inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable law; and

modifications made or agreed to

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER 

        The following questions and answers are intended to address some commonly asked questions regarding the special meeting and the merger. These questions and answers
may not address all questions that may be important to you as a holder of our common stock. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy
statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement.

Q:    Why am I receiving these materials?

        

A: You are receiving this proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card because you owned shares of our common stock at the close of business on December 23, 2016,
the record date for the special meeting. Our Board is soliciting proxies for use at the special meeting to consider and vote upon the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement and other matters to be voted on at the special meeting. These proxy materials provide you information for use in determining how to vote in connection with
the matters to be considered at the special meeting.

Q:    When and where is the special meeting?

        

A: The special meeting will take place on Friday, February 3, 2017, at 2 p.m., Mountain Standard Time, at 10701 South River Front Parkway, Suite 300, South Jordan, Utah
84095.

Q:    What matters will be voted on at the special meeting?

A: We will ask you to consider and vote upon: 

(1) a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger; 

(2) a proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation arrangements disclosed in this proxy statement that may be payable to Headwaters'
named executive officers in connection with the completion of the merger; and 

(3) a proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate in the view of the Board of Directors, to solicit
additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement.

Q:    What is the proposed transaction?

A: On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will
merge with and into Headwaters. At the effective time of the merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and Headwaters will continue as the
surviving company in the merger. After the merger is completed, our common stock will cease to be traded on the NYSE, the registration of our common stock under the
Exchange Act will be terminated and we will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC.

A: If the merger is completed, you will have the right to receive (x) $24.25 in cash, without interest, and (y) the additional consideration, if any, less any applicable
withholding taxes, for each share of our common stock you own, unless you are entitled to demand and have properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance
with, and you comply in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL. In either case, as a result of the merger, your shares will be canceled and you will not own shares in
the surviving company.

Table of Contents

Q:    How does the per-share merger consideration compare to the market price of Headwaters common stock prior to the public announcement of the merger
agreement?

A: The per-share consideration of $24.25 represents a premium of (i) approximately 21% to Headwaters' closing stock price on November 18, 2016, the last trading day prior
to the date on which public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement was made, and (ii) approximately 34%, 36% and 36% over the volume weighted
average share price of the common stock during the 30, 60 and 90 days, respectively, ended November 18, 2016, the last trading day prior to the date on which public
announcement of the execution of the merger agreement was made.

Q:    Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A: No. Please do not send your stock certificates now. If the merger is completed, you will receive shortly thereafter a letter of transmittal instructing you to send your stock
certificates to the paying agent in order to receive the cash payment of the merger consideration for each share of our common stock represented by your stock
certificates. You should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the cash payment to which you are entitled upon completion of the merger.
Please do not send in your stock certificates with your proxy card.

Q:    What happens if I sell or transfer my shares of common stock after the record date, but before the special meeting?

A: If you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock after the record date, but before the special meeting, you will transfer the right to receive the merger consideration,
if the merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the special
meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of common stock after the record date, we encourage you to complete, date, sign and return the
enclosed proxy or vote via the Internet or telephone.

Q:    What vote is required to approve the merger proposal and thereby approve the merger?

        

A: Under Delaware law, and as a condition to the completion of the merger, approval of the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Headwaters common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Accordingly, (1) a Headwaters stockholder's failure to submit a proxy card or to
vote in person at the special meeting, (2) an abstention from voting or (3) a broker non-vote, if any, will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.
As of the record date, there were 74,883,657 shares of Headwaters common stock outstanding.

Q:    What vote is required for the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal?

A: Assuming a quorum is present, approval of the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
the shares of Headwaters common stock that are present at the special meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal. Abstentions will have the same
effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal. Broker non-votes, if any, and, assuming a quorum is present, shares not
in attendance at the special meeting, will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal.

Q:    What vote is required for the adjournment proposal?

A: Assuming a quorum is present, approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Headwaters common stock
that are present at the

special meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the adjournment proposal. Broker
non-votes, if any, and, assuming a quorum is present, shares not in attendance at the special meeting, will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the adjournment
proposal.

Q:    Has any company stockholder agreed to vote company shares in favor of the merger?

        

A. Yes. Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Kirk A. Benson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, entered into the voting agreement with Boral,
pursuant to which Mr. Benson, among other things, is required to vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of December 23, 2016, Mr. Benson is entitled
to vote approximately 1,575,665 shares of our common stock, or approximately 2.1% of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. See the section
titled "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Voting Agreement" beginning on page 60 of this proxy statement.

Q.    What is "merger-related compensation"?

A. "Merger-related compensation" is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the completion of the merger and may be payable to Headwaters' named executive
officers under our existing plans or agreements, which is the subject of the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal. See "Proposal No. 2—
Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation" beginning on page 98 of this proxy statement.

Q.    Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve "merger-related compensation" payable to Headwaters' named executive officers under its
plans or agreements?

A. In accordance with the rules promulgated under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Headwaters is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding,
advisory vote on the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal on the compensation that may be payable to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger.

Q.    What will happen if the stockholders do not approve the "merger-related compensation" in the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal at
the special meeting?

A: Approval of the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger. The vote with respect to the merger-
related named executive officer compensation proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on Headwaters or Boral. Further, the underlying compensation plans
and agreements are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, payment of the "merger-related compensation" is not
contingent on stockholder approval of the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal.

Q.    Are there any other risks to me from the merger that I should consider?

A. Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the merger. Please see the section titled "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking
Information" beginning on page 27 of this proxy statement.

Q:    What constitutes a quorum?

A: At the special meeting, stockholders holding a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the special meeting, represented in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum.
When a quorum is present to organize a meeting, it is not broken by the subsequent withdrawal of any stockholders. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, are
considered as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

Q:    Do any of Headwaters' directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of Headwaters shareholders generally?

        

A: In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that our
directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a shareholder. The members of the Board of
Directors were aware of these different or additional interests and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and overseeing the negotiation of the
merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending to the stockholders of Headwaters that they adopt the merger agreement, and approve the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the merger. These interests are discussed in more detail in the sections titled "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—
Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger" beginning on page 57 of this proxy statement.

Q:    How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?

A: After considering various reasons to approve the merger agreement, as well as certain countervailing factors, the Board of Directors unanimously determined the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, to be advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Headwaters and its
stockholders and unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Certain factors considered
by the Board of Directors in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger can be found in the section titled "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the
Merger Agreement—Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 44 of this proxy statement.

        The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that Headwaters stockholders vote:

(1) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger; 

(2) "FOR" the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal; and 

(3) "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

Q:    What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner?

A: Most of our stockholders hold their shares through a nominee rather than directly in their own names. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares
held of record and those owned beneficially. 

• Stockholder of Record.  If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you are considered
the stockholder of record with respect to those shares and this proxy statement is being sent directly to you by us. As the stockholder of record, you have the right
to grant your voting proxy directly to the proxies named in the enclosed proxy card or to vote your shares in person at the special meeting. We have enclosed a
proxy card for you to use. 

• Beneficial Owner.  If your shares are held in a brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street
name," and this proxy statement is being forwarded to you, together with a voting instruction card, by your nominee who is considered the stockholder of record
with respect to those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your nominee on how to vote your shares and you are also invited to attend the
special meeting where you may vote your shares in person by following the procedure described below.

Table of Contents

Q:    How do I vote my shares of Headwaters common stock?

A: Before you vote, you should carefully read and consider the information contained in or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, including the annexes. You
should also determine whether you hold your shares of our common stock directly in your name as a stockholder of record or through a nominee, because this will
determine the procedure that you must follow in order to vote. You are a stockholder of record if you hold your Headwaters common stock in certificate form or if you
hold your Headwaters common stock in your name directly with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company. If you are a stockholder of record, you
may vote in any of the following ways: 

• Via the Internet—If you choose to grant a proxy via the internet, go to the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card and follow the easy instructions. You will
need the control number shown on your proxy card in order to vote. 

• Via Telephone—If you choose to grant a proxy via telephone, use a touch-tone telephone to call the phone number indicated on the enclosed proxy card and
follow the easy voice prompts. You will need the control number shown on your proxy card in order to vote. 

• Via Mail—If you choose to grant a proxy by mail, simply mark your proxy card, date and sign it, and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided. Proxy cards
that are returned without a signature will not be counted as present at the special meeting and cannot be voted. 

• At the Special Meeting—Stockholders of record who attend the special meeting may vote in person by filling out a ballot at the meeting, and any previously
submitted proxies will be revoked by the vote cast at the special meeting. Even if you intend to attend and vote at the special meeting, our Board recommends that
you grant a proxy via the internet, telephone or mail in case you are later unable to attend the special meeting to ensure that your vote is counted.

Q:    If I hold my shares through a nominee, will my nominee vote my shares for me?

A: Your nominee will not be able to vote on the merger or any proposal without your instructions. You should follow the procedures provided by your nominee regarding the
voting of your shares. If you do not instruct your nominee to vote your shares, your shares will not be voted, which will be treated as a vote against the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement.

Q:    What is a broker non-vote?

A: Under NYSE rules, banks, brokers and other nominees may use their discretion to vote uninstructed shares (i.e., shares held of record by banks, brokerage firms or other
nominees but with respect to which the beneficial owner of such shares has not provided instructions on how to vote on a particular proposal) with respect to matters that
are considered to be "routine," but not with respect to "non-routine" matters. A "broker non-vote" occurs on an item when (i) a broker, nominee or intermediary has
discretionary authority to vote on one or more proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders, but is not permitted to vote on other proposals without instructions
from the beneficial owner of the shares and (ii) the beneficial owner fails to provide the broker, nominee or intermediary with such instructions. Because none of the
proposals to be voted on at the special meeting are routine matters for which brokers may have discretionary authority to vote, we do not expect there to be any broker
non-votes.

Q:    What happens if I return my proxy card but I do not indicate how to vote?

A: If you sign and properly return your proxy card, but do not include instructions on how to vote, your shares of our common stock will be voted

Table of Contents

(1) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger; 

(2) "FOR" the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal; and 

(3) "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

We do not currently intend to present any other proposals for consideration at the special meeting. If other proposals requiring a vote of stockholders are brought before
the special meeting in a proper manner, the persons named in the enclosed proxy card will have discretion to vote the shares they represent in accordance with their best
judgment.

Q:    What happens if I abstain from voting on a proposal?

A: If you sign and return a proxy card or grant a proxy over the internet or by telephone but affirmatively abstain from voting on the merger proposal, the merger-related
named executive officer compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the applicable proposal or proposals.

Q:    May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card or otherwise submitted my vote?

A: Yes. Even if you sign and return the proxy card accompanying this proxy statement, you retain the power to revoke your proxy or change your vote. You can revoke your
proxy or change your vote at any time before it is exercised by giving written notice to our Corporate Secretary at Headwaters Incorporated, 10701 South River Front
Parkway, Suite 300, South Jordan, Utah 84095, United States, Attn: Corporate Secretary, specifying such revocation or change in vote. You may also change your vote by
delivery of a valid, later-dated proxy prior to the special meeting or by attending and voting at the special meeting.

Q:    What does it mean if I receive more than one set of proxy materials?

A: This means that you own shares of our common stock that are registered under different names. For example, you may own some shares directly as a stockholder of
record and other shares through a broker or you may own shares through more than one broker. In these situations, you will receive multiple sets of proxy materials. You
must complete, sign, date and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions for any alternative voting procedure on each of the voting instruction cards that you
receive in order to vote all of the shares you own. Each proxy card you receive comes with its own prepaid return envelope; if you vote by mail, make sure you return
each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanies that proxy card.

Q:    When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A: Headwaters and Boral are working to complete the merger promptly, and we intend it to be completed in mid-calendar year 2017. The merger is subject, however, to
various regulatory approvals and other conditions to closing, which are described in more detail in this proxy statement, and it is possible that factors outside the control
of either company could result in the merger being completed at a later time, or not at all.

Q:    If the merger is completed, how will I receive the cash for my shares?

A: If the merger is completed and your shares of our common stock are held in book-entry through the Depository Trust Company, which we refer to as "DTC" in this proxy
statement, or in "street name" by a broker or other nominee, the cash proceeds will be deposited into your bank or brokerage account without any further action on your
part. If you are a stockholder of record with your shares held in certificate form or held directly in your name in book-entry form other than

Table of Contents

through DTC, you will receive a letter of transmittal with instructions for returning such letter of transmittal, and, in the case of holders of share certificates, how to send
your share certificates to the paying agent, in connection with the merger. The paying agent will issue and deliver to you a check for your shares after you comply with
these instructions. See the section titled "Terms of the Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—Payment Procedures" beginning on page 74 of this proxy statement.

Q:    Is the merger taxable to me?

A: The exchange of shares of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes to U.S. holders
(as defined in the section titled "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger—Tax
Consequences to U.S. Holders" beginning on page 63 of this proxy statement). If you are a U.S. holder and your shares of our common stock are converted into the right
to receive cash in the merger, you will generally recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the
amount of cash received with respect to such shares and your adjusted tax basis in such shares. The exchange of shares of our common stock for cash pursuant to the
merger will generally not result in a non-U.S. holder (as defined in the section titled "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders" beginning on page 64 of this proxy statement) being subject to U.S. federal income
tax unless the non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the U.S. You should read the section titled "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 62 of this proxy statement for a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders. You should also consult your tax advisor for a complete analysis of the particular tax consequences of
the merger to you, including the applicability and effect of any U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. tax laws.

Q:    What happens if the merger is not completed?

A: If the merger agreement is not adopted by the stockholders at the special meeting or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will not receive the
merger consideration or any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Headwaters will remain a public company and our
common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act and Headwaters will continue to file periodic reports with the
SEC. In certain circumstances, we may be required to pay, or may be entitled to receive, a termination fee, may be required to reimburse Boral's expenses (subject to
certain limitations) or we may seek other remedies in connection with a termination of the merger agreement, in each case, as described under "Terms of the Merger
Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Termination Fees" and "Terms of the Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement—Effect of
Termination" beginning on page 95 of this proxy statement.

Q:    Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the merger consideration for my shares?

A: Yes. In order to exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow the requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. Under Delaware law, if the merger is completed,
stockholders of Headwaters who do not vote in favor of adopting the merger agreement and who meet the other requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL will
have the right to receive payment of the fair value of their shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with

interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made
by the surviving company pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL). Your appraisal rights are subject to a number of restrictions and technical requirements
(including relating to the aggregate amount of shares of common stock owned by stockholders seeking appraisal). Appraisal rights will only be available to Headwaters
stockholders that deliver to Headwaters a written demand for appraisal of their shares prior to the special meeting, do not vote in favor of the merger proposal, hold their
shares continuously through the effective time of the merger, do not submit their shares for payment of the merger consideration, and otherwise comply with the statutory
procedures and requirements set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in this proxy statement. The amount determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery to be the fair value of Headwaters stock as of the effective time of the merger could be more than, the same as, or less than the merger consideration a
stockholder would be entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement. A summary of Section 262 of the DGCL can be found along with additional
information about appraisal rights under "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 65 of this proxy statement. The
discussion of appraisal rights contained in this proxy statement is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its
entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL that is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement.

Q:    Who will count the votes?

A: The votes will be counted by Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.

Q:    Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?

A: Headwaters intends to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC
following the special meeting. All periodic and current reports Headwaters files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. See "Where Stockholders Can Find More
Information" beginning on page 109 of this proxy statement.

Q:    What is "householding"?

A: "Householding" means that we deliver a single set of proxy materials when requested to households with multiple stockholders, provided certain conditions are met.
Householding reduces our printing and mailing costs.

If you or another stockholder of record sharing your address would like to receive an additional copy of the proxy materials, we will promptly deliver it to you upon your
request in one of the following manners:

• By sending a written request by mail to:

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

        Some of the statements contained or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement are "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements relating to the completion of the merger, expectations as to the managing and marketing of coal
combustion products and other construction materials, the production and marketing of building products, the sales to oil refineries of residue hydrocracking catalysts, the
development, commercialization, and financing of new products and other strategic business opportunities and acquisitions and other information about Headwaters which is not
purely historical by nature. Forward-looking statements can usually be identified by the use of terminology such as "anticipate," "believe," "continue," "could," "estimate,"
"evolve," "expect," "forecast," "intend," "looking ahead," "may," "opinion," "plan," "possible," "potential," "project," "should," "will" and similar words or expressions. These
statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated as a result of
various factors, including: (1) Headwaters may be unable to obtain stockholder approval as required for the merger; (2) conditions to the completion of the merger, including the
obtaining of required regulatory approvals, may not be satisfied; (3) the merger may involve unexpected costs, liabilities or delays; (4) the business of Headwaters may suffer as a
result of uncertainty surrounding the merger; (5) the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the merger; (6) Headwaters may be adversely affected by other economic,
business, and/or competitive factors; (7) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; (8) the ability
to recognize benefits of the merger; (9) risks that the merger disrupts current plans and operations and the potential difficulties in employee retention as a result of the merger;
(10) other risks to consummation of the merger, including the risk that the merger will not be consummated within the expected time period or at all; (11) changing feedstock and
energy prices; actions of competitors or regulators; technological developments; (12) potential disruption of Headwaters' production facilities, transportation networks and
information technology systems due to war, terrorism, malicious attack, civil accidents, political events, civil unrest or severe weather; (13) potential environmental liability or
product liability under existing or future laws and litigation; (14) potential liability resulting from other pending or future litigation; (15) changed accounting rules under
generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; (16) the risks described from time to time in Headwaters' reports filed with the SEC under the
heading "Risk Factors," including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on
Form 8-K and in other of Headwaters' filings with the SEC; and (17) general industry and economic conditions. The foregoing factors that could cause actual events to differ
from expectations should not be construed as exhaustive. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
on which such statements were made. We can give no assurance that the conditions to the merger will be satisfied. Except as required by applicable law, Headwaters undertakes
no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after such date.

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        This section contains information about the special meeting of Headwaters' stockholders that has been called to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger
agreement, a proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation arrangements disclosed in this proxy statement that may be payable to Headwaters' named
executive officers in connection with the completion of the merger and a proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate
in the view of the Board of Directors, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement.

        This proxy statement is being provided to the stockholders of Headwaters as part of a solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors for use at the special meeting to be
held at the date, time and place specified below, and at any properly convened meeting following an adjournment or postponement thereof, for the purposes set forth in this proxy
statement and in the accompanying notice of special meeting.

Date, Time and Place 

        The special meeting of stockholders of Headwaters is scheduled to be held on Friday, February 3, 2017, at 2 p.m., Mountain Standard Time, at 10701 South River Front
Parkway, Suite 300, South Jordan, Utah 84095, unless the special meeting is adjourned or postponed. We intend to mail this proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card on

Purpose of the Special Meeting 

        At the special meeting, stockholders will be asked:

• to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger; 

• to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation arrangements disclosed in this proxy statement that may be
payable to Headwaters' named executive officers in connection with the completion of the merger; and 

• to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate in the view of the Board of
Directors to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement.

        Certain factors considered by the Board of Directors in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger can be found in the section titled "Proposal
No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 44 of this proxy statement.

Recommendations of Our Board of Directors

        After considering various reasons to approve the merger agreement, as well as certain countervailing factors, the Board of Directors unanimously determined the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, to be advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Headwaters and its stockholders, and
unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Certain factors considered by the Board of Directors
in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger can be found in the section titled "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Reasons for the
Merger" beginning on page 44 of this proxy statement.

Table of Contents

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that Headwaters stockholders vote: 

(1) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger; 

(2) "FOR" the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal; and 

(3) "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

Record Date and Voting Information 

        Only holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on December 23, 2016, the record date for the special meeting, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at,
the special meeting and any adjournments or postponements thereof. Each holder of record of our common stock on the record date will be entitled to one vote for each share
held as of the record date on each matter submitted to our stockholders for approval at the special meeting. If you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock after the
record date but before the special meeting, you will transfer the right to receive the per share merger consideration, if the merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or
transfer your shares of our common stock, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the special meeting.

        As of the close of business on the record date, there were 74,883,657 shares of Headwaters common stock, par value $0.001 per share, issued, outstanding and entitled to
vote at the special meeting, which shares were held by approximately 276 holders of record.

        Nominees typically have the authority to vote on "routine" proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. Absent specific instructions from the
beneficial owner of the shares, however, nominees are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to the approval of non-routine matters. At the special meeting,
nominees do not have the authority to vote without instructions from the beneficial owner because none of the proposals is "routine."

Quorum 

        At the special meeting, stockholders holding a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the special meeting, represented in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum.
When a quorum is present to organize a meeting, it is not broken by the subsequent withdrawal of any such stockholders. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, are considered
as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. In the event that a quorum is not present, or if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at
the time of the special meeting, it is expected the meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies (subject to any applicable limitations in the merger agreement).

Required Vote; Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 

        Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Headwaters common stock entitled to vote at the
special meeting. Assuming a quorum is present, approval of each of the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Headwaters common stock that are present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on such proposal. Abstentions
will have the same effect as votes "AGAINST" the merger proposal, the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal.

        Shares not in attendance will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal,
but will have the same effect as votes "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

        If you hold your shares through a nominee and fail to instruct your nominee on how you wish your shares of Headwaters common stock to be voted using the voting
instruction form provided by your nominee, then your shares will not be voted. "Broker non-votes," if any, will not be counted as votes either "FOR" or "AGAINST" the merger-
related named executive officer compensation proposal or the adjournment proposal, but will have the effect of a vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

        It is important that you vote your shares. Under the DGCL, the merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our
common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting and your abstaining from voting, failure to vote, or failure to instruct your Nominee to vote, will have the same effect as a
vote "AGAINST" the merger proposal.

        If the special meeting is adjourned or postponed for any reason, and the record date remains unchanged, at any subsequent reconvening of the special meeting, all proxies
will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the special meeting, except for any proxies that have been revoked or withdrawn in
the interim.

Voting by Stockholders 

        After carefully reading and considering the information contained in or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, including the annexes, each stockholder of record
of Headwaters common stock (that is, if your shares of Headwaters common stock are registered in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company) should grant a proxy to vote by mail, through the internet, or by telephone or attend the special meeting in person and vote by ballot, according to the instructions
described below. Each beneficial owner of Headwaters common stock (that is, if your shares of Headwaters common stock are held in "street name" through a nominee) should
vote by directing your nominee how to vote your shares.

Voting Methods 

For Stockholders of Record:

        If your shares are held in your name on the records of our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you can vote:

• Via the Internet—If you choose to grant a proxy via the internet, go to the website indicated on the enclosed proxy card and follow the easy instructions. You will
need the control number shown on your proxy card in order to vote; 

• Via Telephone—If you choose to grant a proxy via telephone, use a touch-tone telephone to call the phone number indicated on the enclosed proxy card and
follow the easy voice prompts. You will need the control number shown on your proxy card in order to vote. 

• Via Mail—If you choose to grant a proxy by mail, simply mark your proxy card, date and sign it, and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided. Proxy cards
that are returned without a signature will not be counted as present at the special meeting and cannot be voted. 

• At the Special Meeting—Stockholders of record who attend the special meeting may vote in person by filling out a ballot at the meeting, and any previously
submitted proxies will be revoked by the vote cast at the special meeting. Even if you intend to attend and vote at the special meeting, our Board recommends that
you grant a proxy via the internet, telephone or mail in case you are later unable to attend the special meeting to ensure that your vote is counted.

        Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting in person, we request that you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card or submit your proxy via the
internet or by telephone prior to the special meeting to ensure that your shares will be voted at the special meeting. Proxies

received at any time before the special meeting and not expired, revoked or superseded before being voted will be voted at the special meeting. If the proxy indicates a
specification, it will be voted in accordance with the specification. If no specification is indicated, the proxy will be voted

(1) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger; 

(2) "FOR" the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal; and 

(3) "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

        Please do not send us stock certificates or other documents representing Headwaters common stock at this time. If the merger is completed, holders of Headwaters
stock certificates will receive instructions regarding the procedures for exchanging their existing Headwaters stock certificates for the payment of the merger
consideration.

For Beneficial Owners:

        If your shares are held in "street name" through a nominee, you have the right to direct your nominee on how to vote your shares. Because a beneficial owner is not the
stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares at the special meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to
vote the shares at the special meeting.

Revocation of Proxies

        Headwaters stockholders of record retain the power to revoke their proxy or change their vote, even if they sign the proxy card in the form accompanying this proxy
statement, vote via the internet or vote via telephone. Headwaters stockholders can revoke their proxy at any time before it is exercised by giving written notice to our Corporate
Secretary at Headwaters Incorporated, 10701 South River Front Parkway, Suite 300, South Jordan, Utah 84095, United States, Attn: Corporate Secretary, specifying such
revocation. Headwaters stockholders may also change their vote by timely delivering to us a valid, later-dated proxy or by voting by ballot in person at the special meeting.
Simply attending the special meeting will not constitute revocation of your proxy. If your shares are held in "street name" through a nominee, you should follow the instructions
of such nominee regarding the revocation of voting instructions. If you have voted via the internet or via telephone, you may change your vote by signing on to the website and
following the prompts or calling the toll-free number again and following the instructions.

Voting by Headwaters' Directors and Executive Officers as to the Merger Proposal 

        At the close of business on the record date for the special meeting, directors and executive officers of Headwaters and their affiliates beneficially owned, in the aggregate,
2,044,276 shares of Headwaters common stock which they are entitled to vote at the special meeting, representing approximately 2.7% of the shares of Headwaters common
stock outstanding on the record date and entitled to vote at the special meeting. We currently expect that Headwaters' directors and executive officers will vote their shares in
favor of the merger proposal, although Kirk A. Benson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the only one that has entered into any agreement obligating himself or
herself to do so.

        Certain directors and executive officers of Headwaters have interests as to the merger proposal that may be different from, or in addition to, those of other Headwaters
stockholders generally. For more information, see the section titled "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger" beginning
on page 57 of this proxy statement.

Expenses of Proxy Solicitation 

        This proxy statement is being furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board of Directors. Expenses incurred in connection with printing and mailing
of this proxy statement and in connection with notices or other filings with any governmental entities under any laws is our responsibility. We have engaged The Proxy Advisory
Group, LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies and provide related advice and informational support, for a services fee, plus customary disbursements, which are not expected
to exceed $35,000, and we will indemnify The Proxy Advisory Group, LLC for certain losses arising out of its proxy solicitation services. Copies of solicitation materials will
also be furnished to banks, brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians holding shares of Headwaters common stock in their names that are beneficially owned by others to
forward to those beneficial owners. We may reimburse persons representing beneficial owners of our common stock for their costs of forwarding solicitation materials to the
beneficial owners. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, proxies may be solicited by our directors, officers and employees, or representatives of The Proxy Advisory
Group, LLC, in person or by telephone, email, fax or other means of communication and we may pay persons holding shares for others their expenses for sending proxy
materials to their principals. No additional compensation will be paid to our directors, officers or employees for their services.

Householding 

        The SEC permits companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy materials with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the
same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially means extra
convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. Stockholders who hold their shares through a nominee, such as a broker, bank, broker-dealer or similar
organization may receive notice from that nominee regarding the householding of proxy materials. As indicated in the notice, a single proxy statement will be delivered to
multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected stockholder. Once a stockholder has received notice that a nominee will
be householding, householding will continue until the stockholder is notified otherwise or until the stockholder has revoked consent by notifying the nominee. If you would
prefer to receive separate copies of a proxy statement for other stockholders in your household, either now or in the future, please contact your nominee. Upon written or oral
request to our Corporate Secretary at Headwaters Incorporated, 10701 South River Front Parkway, Suite 300, South Jordan, Utah 84095, United States, +1.800.316.6214, we will
promptly provide separate copies of this proxy statement.

Tabulation of Votes 

        All votes will be tabulated by Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., who will tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and broker non-votes.

Adjournments and Postponements 

        In addition to the merger proposal and the merger-related named executive officer compensation proposal, our stockholders are also being asked to approve a proposal that
will give our Board authority to adjourn the special meeting from time to time if necessary or appropriate in the view of our Board, to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the merger agreement. In addition, our Board could postpone the meeting before it commences, in the case of any of
the circumstances described above. The merger agreement limits the right of our Board to postpone or adjourn in certain circumstances. If the special meeting is adjourned for the
purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use. If you submit a proxy
and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the merger

against the merger proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal only if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of that proposal.

        Any adjournment may be made without notice to another time or place if the date, time and place to which the meeting is adjourned is announced at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting any business may be transacted that might have been transacted on the original date of the meeting. However, if the adjournment
is for more than 30 days or, if after the adjournment, our Board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the adjourned meeting.

Attending the Special Meeting 

        Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 23, 2016, or their duly appointed proxies, and "street name" holders (those whose shares are held
through a nominee) who bring evidence of beneficial ownership on the record date for the special meeting, such as a copy of your account statement or similar evidence of
ownership of our common stock as of the record date for the special meeting, may attend the special meeting. If you are a "street name" holder and you wish to vote at the special
meeting, you must also bring a "legal proxy" from the record holder (your nominee) of the shares of our common stock authorizing you to vote at the special meeting. All
stockholders should bring photo identification (a driver's license or passport is preferred), as you will also be asked to provide photo identification at the registration desk on the
day of the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting. Everyone who attends the special meeting must abide by the rules for the conduct of the
meeting. These rules will be printed on the meeting agenda. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to grant a proxy to vote by the internet, telephone

Effects of the Merger 

        On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will merge
with and into Headwaters. At the effective time of the merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and Headwaters will continue as the surviving company,

        At the effective time of the merger, each share of Headwaters common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such time (other than excluded shares) will be
converted into the right to receive (x) $24.25 in cash, without interest, and (y) the additional consideration, if any. All such shares of Headwaters common stock, when so

merger consideration over the applicable exercise price for each share of Headwaters common stock subject to such Headwaters stock option; provided, however, that if the
exercise price per share of Headwaters common stock equals or exceeds the merger consideration, the amount payable for such Headwaters stock option will be $0.00.

Stock Appreciation Rights 

        At the effective time of the merger, each Headwaters stock appreciation right, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will be canceled, without action of the holder, and the holder thereof will be entitled only to receive a cash payment, without interest, in an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of the merger consideration over the applicable base price for each share of Headwaters common stock subject to such Headwaters stock appreciation right; provided,
however, that if the base price per share of Headwaters common stock equals or exceeds the merger consideration, the amount payable for such Headwaters stock appreciation
right will be $0.00.

Director Deferred Compensation Plan 

        For any members of the Board of Directors who elected to have amounts deferred under the Headwaters Director Deferred Compensation Plan deemed invested in
Headwaters common stock, (i) each share of Headwaters common stock purchased by Headwaters and held as treasury stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
in connection with such deferrals will be canceled in accordance with the merger agreement, and (ii) the director will be entitled to receive a cash payment, in respect of each
such share, without interest, in an amount equal to the merger consideration, subject to and payable in accordance with the terms of the Headwaters Director Deferred
Compensation Plan.

Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 

        The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the directors of the surviving company until the earlier of their death, resignation
or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of Headwaters immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
will be the officers of the surviving company until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified,
as the case may be.

        The certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, will be the certificate of incorporation of the surviving
company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law, except that references to the name of Merger Sub will be replaced by references to the
name of the surviving company. The bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, will be the bylaws of the surviving company until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law, except that references to the name of Merger Sub will be replaced by references to the name of the
surviving company.

Background of the Merger 

        During the past several years, as part of its ongoing strategic-planning process, our management team and Board of Directors regularly reviewed and assessed, among other
things, Headwaters' long-term strategic goals and opportunities, competitive environment, and short- and long-term performance, with the goal of maximizing stockholder value.
In connection with these activities, our management team and Board also considered and evaluated potential strategic alternatives, including business combinations, acquisitions,
dispositions and internal restructurings.

        Headwaters began to work with Deutsche Bank in 2011 to provide advice in connection with these strategic assessments. Over the course of several years beginning in 2011,
Headwaters, with the assistance of Deutsche Bank, engaged in an evaluation of, among other things, potential major acquisitions and merger opportunities, a potential sale of the
entire company and potential divestitures of different business segments or business units (including a potential separation and subsequent sale of the company's building
products and construction materials businesses, the potential spin-off of certain of Headwaters' business segments, and potential transactions utilizing a "reverse Morris trust"
structure). This exploration of strategic alternatives included Headwaters and/or Deutsche Bank contacting more than 10 participants in the building products and construction
materials industries regarding potential strategic transactions. Despite varying degrees of interest to acquire a portion of the existing Headwaters businesses, there was no
meaningful interest by any party to acquire Headwaters in its entirety.

Table of Contents

        As early as May 2010, Headwaters had indicated a preliminary interest in acquiring Boral's fly ash business, and the parties from time to time discussed a potential fly ash
transaction between 2010 and 2013. During the period from May 2014 through April 2016, the management teams of Headwaters and Boral met informally to discuss various
possible strategic transactions between the parties, which included the potential sale of Boral's fly ash business to Headwaters, the potential sale of Boral's building products
business to Headwaters and the sale of Headwaters' fly ash, stone and siding businesses to Boral, but not the acquisition of Headwaters by Boral. These discussions did not result
in a transaction between the parties, and discussions between the parties regarding these potential transactions terminated in April 2016. During this time and in parallel with its
discussions with Boral, Headwaters continued its exploration of various strategic alternatives.

        On July 25, 2016, Kirk Benson, Headwaters' CEO, had a meeting with Mike Kane, CEO of Boral, Rosaline Ng, CFO of Boral, and Paul Burns, Executive Director of
Macquarie, a Boral financial advisor, during which Mr. Kane indicated that Boral would be interested in discussing a potential acquisition of Headwaters by Boral. Mr. Kane
indicated that he had worked for some time with his board of directors and advisors to formulate a potential transaction with Headwaters. Mr. Benson responded by indicating
Headwaters was not for sale, but Headwaters would carefully consider any proposal put forth by Boral. Mr. Kane also noted that, in light of Boral's expectation to raise a
meaningful portion of the funds for the transaction through a public offering of Boral's shares immediately following announcement, if the parties desired to announce a
transaction in calendar year 2016, it would need to be announced no later than November 2016 to address the effective closing of the market window for public offerings in
Australia during December 2016. The parties also discussed the possible benefits of combining these largely complementary businesses and the potential for such transaction to
create value through synergies. The parties further discussed the potential timing of further discussions in respect of a potential transaction, and Mr. Kane committed to confer
with his board with a view to providing Headwaters with a written proposal.

        On August 12, 2016, Mr. Kane delivered a written letter to Mr. Benson which communicated a non-binding indicative proposal by Boral to acquire 100% of the outstanding
common stock of Headwaters for a purchase price of $23.75 per share in cash. The letter further indicated that any definitive agreement regarding the proposal would not include
a financing condition, and relayed Boral's expectation to have fully committed financing in place at the time of announcement. The letter also noted that the proposal was subject
to satisfactory completion of customary business, legal, tax and other due diligence, and included an illustrative timeline for announcement in November 2016. Mr. Benson
acknowledged receipt of the proposal letter and responded to Mr. Kane indicating he would seek appropriate advice as to Headwaters' response.

        Following receipt of the proposal, Mr. Benson shared the proposal letter with each of the members of the Headwaters Board of Directors and had various phone calls and
correspondence with the members of the Board of Directors regarding the terms of the proposal.

        On August 14, 2016, Mr. Benson and Mr. Kane had a phone call in which Mr. Benson reported that he had shared Boral's proposal letter with the Headwaters Board of
Directors. While Mr. Benson told Mr. Kane that the Board's general initial reaction was that the proposed price per share of $23.75 was inadequate, Mr. Benson indicated that
Headwaters was not in a position to provide detailed feedback on the proposal because (i) Headwaters needed to understand the value proposition of the Boral offer in the context
of Headwaters' other strategic alternatives and (ii) Headwaters needed to better evaluate regulatory aspects of a potential combination of Boral and Headwaters. Further,
Mr. Benson indicated that the Headwaters management team was in the process of developing its 2017 budgets and needed to incorporate the recent Krestmark windows
acquisition into its annual budget process, but that it would work to finalize the budgets as soon as possible. Mr. Benson told Mr. Kane that he would seek to schedule a Board
meeting the week of September 5, 2016 to review the Boral proposal and Headwaters' other strategic alternatives. Mr. Benson further noted that, in light of the

Board of Directors' recent reviews of a wide range of strategic alternatives on multiple occasions, following an update on these alternatives, the Board of Directors would be well
positioned to evaluate the Boral proposal. Finally, Mr. Benson and Mr. Kane agreed that their respective attorneys should review the existing confidentiality agreement between
the parties and bring those terms current as necessary.

        On August 18, 2016, Boral and Headwaters entered into a confidentiality agreement to facilitate further discussions. This agreement updated and made current the terms of a
pre-existing confidentiality agreement between the parties, including an 18-month standstill provision.

        Following August 18, 2016, representatives of Boral and Headwaters tentatively scheduled a September 12, 2016 meeting in Dallas, Texas and began preparations for such
meeting.

        On September 7, 2016, the Headwaters Board of Directors met in-person with members of Headwaters' management team and representatives of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw
Pittman, LLP, which we refer to as Pillsbury, Headwaters' outside legal counsel, and Deutsche Bank to discuss Boral's August 12, 2016 proposal. At the meeting, representatives
of Pillsbury made a presentation to the Board of Directors regarding the Board of Directors' fiduciary duties and role in considering and responding to Boral's proposal.
Representatives of Deutsche Bank then reviewed with the Board of Directors a summary of Headwaters, prior discussions with Boral and an overview of Boral's August 12
proposal and discussed with the Board of Directors a preliminary financial analysis relating to Boral's August 12, 2016 proposal. Deutsche Bank also reviewed the strategic
alternatives for the company, including maintaining the status quo as a standalone entity, potential mergers with other participants in the building products industry and the
possible separation of the building products and construction materials businesses. Harlan Hatfield, Headwaters' General Counsel, also discussed potential regulatory
considerations in connection with a proposed transaction with Boral. Following these discussions, the Headwaters Board of Directors determined that it was in the company's
best interest to continue to discuss the proposed transaction with Boral, but instructed management to convey to Boral Headwaters' views that: (i) the initial proposal price was
inadequate, (ii) Boral must assume any risks relating to regulatory approvals for the transaction and (iii) the timing of the transaction must be expedited.

        On September 7, 2016, Mr. Benson phoned Mr. Kane to provide feedback relative to the Boral proposal following the Headwaters Board meeting. Mr. Benson indicated to
Mr. Kane the Board of Directors' view that the proposed price was inadequate, but that Headwaters would consider providing initial due diligence access to Boral if Boral's
proposal price could be improved. Mr. Benson further indicated that the three primary areas of importance to the Headwaters Board were an increase in price, Boral's acceptance
of any regulatory risks associated with the transaction, and the timing of execution of a definitive agreement for the proposed transaction.

        On September 8, 2016, representatives of each of Citibank and Macquarie, financial advisors to Boral, and Deutsche Bank had a call, during which Deutsche Bank reiterated
the points conveyed by Mr. Benson to Mr. Kane. The financial advisors discussed certain process and other transaction-related matters, including the potential challenges with
Headwaters' proposed timeline (including the need for Boral to complete its due diligence) and agreed to report back to their respective clients.

        On September 12, 2016, representatives from Boral and Headwaters met in Dallas, Texas for a presentation about the Headwaters business from the Headwaters
management team. Headwaters presented an overview of each of its business units and long range goals and provided Boral with a summary five year financial forecast. During
these meetings, Mr. Benson communicated to Mr. Kane that, among other things, in order for Headwaters to proceed with any potential transaction with Boral, Headwaters would
require (i) a reverse termination fee payable to Headwaters in the event the transaction is not consummated as a result of the inability to obtain regulatory approvals, which is
referred to as the "reverse termination fee" and (ii) clarification regarding Boral's commitment to make divestitures or take other actions if needed to obtain regulatory approvals
for the transaction, which is referred to as the "regulatory efforts provisions." The parties agreed to schedule a further due diligence meeting to be held on September 29, 2016.

        On September 19, 2016, Boral distributed business and legal due diligence request lists to Headwaters. Over the next two months, management of Boral, together with its
advisors, conducted a due diligence investigation of Headwaters, including access to an online data room that was established by representatives of Headwaters and through
numerous meetings and conference calls with representatives of Headwaters management and its advisors.

        On September 27, 2016, Mr. Benson telephoned Mr. Kane to discuss the status of due diligence and the previously scheduled September 29, 2016 due diligence meeting.
Mr. Benson decided to postpone the proposed September 29, 2016 due diligence meetings because the parties had not yet come to sufficient agreement in principle on key
transaction terms. Mr. Benson further reiterated to Mr. Kane the importance to Headwaters of maximizing certainty of consummation for any transaction.

        On September 28, 2016, Mr. Benson and Mr. Kane had a further telephone conversation regarding the potential key terms for the transaction. Boral's financial advisors
communicated to Headwaters' financial advisor that Boral would consider a reverse termination fee and regulatory efforts provisions.

        On October 5, 2016, representatives from Boral and Headwaters met in Los Angeles, California to review the 2017 budget and operating plan that had been prepared by the
Headwaters management team. This budget included a budget for each business unit and a consolidated budget. In addition to the budget presentation, the status of due diligence
requests and the timing of the potential transaction were discussed.

        On October 14, 2016, Mr. Benson and Mr. Kane had an in-person meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah during which a potential organizational structure for the combined
businesses was discussed.

        On October 15, 2016, Mr. Benson and Mr. Kane had an in-person meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah during which the overall status of Boral's due diligence review and
transaction timing issues were discussed.

        On October 21, 2016 Mr. Kane and Mr. Benson had a telephone call in which each of the Boral and Headwaters management teams participated during which Mr. Kane
communicated to Mr. Benson Boral's revised offer, which included: (i) confirmation of Boral's original price per share of $23.75, (ii) a reverse termination fee payable by Boral
in the event the transaction was not consummated due to failure to obtain regulatory approvals, (iii) a commitment by Boral to use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions
(including divestitures) necessary to obtain competition approvals, subject to certain limitations which is referred to as the "divestiture cap," (iv) a break-up fee payable to Boral,
in the event that, among other things, Headwaters were to terminate the merger agreement to accept a "superior proposal", which is referred to as the "superior proposal break-up
fee," and (v) reimbursement by Headwaters of Boral's fees and expenses in the event that the transaction is not approved by Headwaters' stockholders, subject to certain
limitations. Mr. Benson indicated that he would relay this revised proposal to the Board of Directors of Headwaters and provide a response to Boral in due course.

        On October 22, 2016, Mr. Kane and Mr. Benson had a telephone call to schedule a proposed diligence session with the business unit leaders from Headwaters, and seeking
to broaden the members of the Headwaters team involved in Boral's ongoing due diligence review.

        On October 27, 2016, the Headwaters Board of Directors held an in-person meeting with members of the Headwaters management team. The primary purpose of the
meeting was to review the operating plans for fiscal year 2017. During the course of the meeting, the status of Boral's due diligence review was discussed, together with
observations on significant transaction points. The Board of Directors debated the pros and cons of the potential transaction with Boral as opposed to maintaining and growing
Headwaters as a standalone business. During this meeting, the Board of Directors scheduled a further meeting on November 9, 2016 to have an in depth discussion of the
potential transaction with Boral.

        On October 30, 2016, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, which we refer to as Skadden, counsel for Boral, delivered to Pillsbury, Winthrop, Shaw, Pittman LLP,
which we refer to as Pillsbury, counsel for Headwaters, an initial draft merger agreement. During the next several weeks, representatives of Skadden and Pillsbury, together with
members of senior management of Headwaters and Boral, negotiated the terms of the merger agreement, exchanging numerous drafts of the merger agreement and participating
in telephone conference calls to resolve open issues. During this time, representatives of Headwaters, Boral and their respective advisors also continued their due diligence
investigations.

        From November 2, 2016 through November 4, 2016, various leaders of the Headwaters business units met with representatives of Boral in Washington, D.C. for multiple
meetings regarding both business and legal due diligence and the assessment of regulatory transaction considerations. Senior personnel from Headwaters construction materials,
siding accessories, block, roofing and stone business units met separately with Boral representatives. Each business unit provided due diligence regarding its organizational
structure and its approach to selling products to customers.

        On November 9, 2016, the Headwaters Board of Directors held an in-person meeting with members of Headwaters' management and representatives of Pillsbury to further
discuss Boral's October 21, 2016 proposal, as well as certain other strategic alternatives. Representatives of Pillsbury then provided an update to the Headwaters Board of
Directors regarding the Board of Directors' fiduciary duties. Mr. Benson then made a presentation to the Headwaters Board of Directors, which included, among other things, a
review of the strategic alternatives that the Board of Directors had considered between 2011 and the present date with the assistance of its financial advisor, recent developments
in the building products and construction materials industries and the pros and cons of Headwaters' strategic alternatives relative to the proposed transaction with Boral.
Mr. Benson then reviewed for the Board of Directors the October 2016 performance of Headwaters, and the Board of Directors discussed Headwaters' standalone plan, as well as
the potential impact of certain alternative strategic acquisitions. Mr. Benson then reviewed with the Board of Directors certain financial analysis relating to Headwaters based on
materials prepared with the assistance of Deutsche Bank. Mr. Benson also discussed potential synergies that may be realized in connection with the Boral transaction.
Representatives of Pillsbury then reviewed certain regulatory considerations relating to the proposed transaction. Following the presentations by Pillsbury and Mr. Benson, and
after review and deliberation considering, among other things, (i) Boral's latest proposal, (ii) the prospects for Headwaters as a standalone company and the risks to achieving
those prospects, (iii) potential strategic alternatives available to Headwaters, (iv) the financial information presented by management, which had been prepared with the
assistance of Deutsche Bank, (v) the regulatory aspects of a sale to Boral and (vi) the Board of Directors' fiduciary duties, the Headwaters Board of Directors unanimously
determined to reject Boral's October 21, 2016 proposal, but directed the management team to continue the negotiation process in order to obtain a "best and final" proposal from
Boral.

        On November 10, 2016 Headwaters entered into an engagement letter with Deutsche Bank, memorializing the terms of Deutsche Bank's engagement as Headwaters'
financial advisor in connection with its exploration of strategic alternatives, including a potential transaction with Boral.

        On November 13, 2016, Mr. Kane and Damien Sullivan, General Counsel for Boral, telephoned Mr. Benson and Mr. Hatfield to communicate a revised proposal that
maintained all of the components of Boral's October 21 proposal, except for an increase in the divesture cap. Mr. Benson responded that the increase to $15 million of earnings
before interest and taxes, or EBIT, on the divestiture cap might be acceptable to the Headwaters Board, but the price per share and the value of the reverse termination fee were
going to be too low for the Headwaters Board to accept. Mr. Kane indicated that he would revert on November 14, 2016.

        On November 14, 2016, Mr. Kane notified Mr. Benson that he planned to confer with the Boral Board of Directors at a meeting to be held on November 16, 2016 and would
revert following that meeting.

        On November 15, 2016, Pillsbury delivered to Skadden a revised draft of the merger agreement. Also on November 15, 2016, Skadden delivered to Pillsbury an initial draft
of the voting agreement pursuant to which Mr. Benson would agree to vote substantially all of his shares of common stock in favor of the merger. The final terms of the voting
agreement were negotiated over the course of the days that followed, and the voting agreement was finalized and executed in conjunction with the execution of the merger
agreement.

        On November 16, 2016, Mr. Kane telephoned Mr. Benson to indicate that the Boral board of directors had approved a revised proposal that included a price of $24.25 per
share and a reverse termination fee of 4% of equity value. Mr. Kane also proposed an increase in the superior proposal termination fee, in light of the significant increase in the
reverse termination fee. In addition, Mr. Kane relayed a revised expense reimbursement proposal whereby, in the event that the transaction is not approved by Headwaters'
stockholders, Headwaters would reimburse Boral's fees and expenses up to a cap, except that, in light of the significant expense that Boral would incur in the event that the Boral
equity offering were consummated but the merger did not close, this cap on expense reimbursement would be higher following consummation of the equity offering. Mr. Kane
indicated that this offer was Boral's "full and final" offer, and that Boral's board of directors was not prepared to further increase the offer. Mr. Kane further indicated that, given
the impact of Boral's stock price on the cost of Boral's equity financing, this last proposed offer was subject to Boral's stock maintaining prior to announcement of the transaction
a price per share consistent with then recent trading prices.

        Later on the night of November 16, 2016, Skadden delivered to Pillsbury a further revised draft of the merger agreement. Between November 16, 2016 and the execution of
the merger agreement on November 20, 2016, Skadden, Pillsbury and other representatives of Boral and Headwaters continued to negotiate and exchange revised drafts of the
merger agreement. Representatives of Boral (including Alston & Bird LLP, outside counsel to Boral) also continued to work to complete Boral's due diligence, including to work
with representatives of Headwaters and Pillsbury to review, discuss and finalize Headwaters' disclosure schedules to the merger agreement.

        During the early hours of November 17, 2016, Skadden delivered to Pillsbury redacted versions of Boral's equity and debt financing commitment documentation. In the days
that followed, representatives of Boral and Headwaters discussed the financing documentation (and representatives of Boral further discussed the financing documentation with
representatives of the applicable underwriters and lenders), including to seek to further limit the scope of the conditions to funding under such documentation.

        Also on November 17, 2016, following a decline in Boral's stock price from the prior day, Mr. Benson asked for Mr. Kane to confirm the last Boral proposal communicated.
Later on November 17, 2016, in response to Mr. Benson's request, Mr. Kane reconfirmed Boral's previously communicated proposal of $24.25 per share, subject to final approval
by Boral's board of directors on November 20, 2016.

        On November 18, 2016, the Headwaters Board held an in-person meeting with members of Headwaters' management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
further discuss Boral's revised proposal of November 16, 2016. Representatives of Pillsbury then provided an update to the Headwaters Board regarding regulatory
considerations relating to the proposed transaction. Representatives of Deutsche Bank reviewed certain financial information with the Headwaters Board, including among other
things, recent developments in the market, Headwaters standalone plan and associated market risks, including developments in the building products sector, implications of the
recent U.S. presidential election and certain preliminary financial analysis relating to Headwaters.

Deutsche Bank also reviewed previous efforts made by Headwaters to pursue potential strategic transactions, including that no other buyers had expressed an interest in acquiring
the entirety of the Headwaters business. Following these discussions, and after careful review and deliberation, the Board of Directors unanimously determined that, while the
reverse termination fee, superior proposal break-up fee and divestiture caps were acceptable, the Board of Directors required a further improvement in Boral's proposed terms in
the form of either (i) an increase in the merger price by $0.25 per share or (ii) additional protection for Headwaters' stockholders against a potential delay in closing due to
regulatory approvals, such that Boral would be required to pay additional per share merger consideration as a "ticking fee" in the event that regulatory approvals were not
obtained by June 1, 2017. The Board of Directors instructed Mr. Benson to relay these further requirements to Boral.

        Following the Headwaters Board meeting on November 18, Mr. Benson telephoned Mr. Kane and communicated the acceptance of the proposed reverse termination fee,
divesture cap and superior proposal break-up fee, together with Headwaters' requirement for a price increase of $0.25 per share or a "ticking fee" of an additional $0.07 per share
for each month between June 1, 2017 and the merger closing.

        On November 19, 2016, Mr. Kane telephoned Mr. Benson to indicate that, in response to the last Headwaters counter-proposal, Boral would propose a "ticking fee" of $0.09
per month for each month between September 1, 2017 (in the event the closing has not occurred by such date due to delays in receiving regulatory approvals) and the merger
closing. Mr. Kane and Mr. Benson also discussed the proposed organizational structure upon consummation of the proposed transaction, as well as an agreement to set aside
$10 million, with certain potential increases, for certain programs to incentivize Headwaters employees to stay with the company through and after the closing of the proposed
transaction.

        Later that day, the Headwaters Board met by telephone with management and representatives of Pillsbury and Deutsche Bank. At the meeting, Mr. Benson reported to the
Board of Directors the response he had received earlier that day from Mr. Kane. Representatives of Pillsbury then reviewed a summary of certain material terms of the merger
agreement. Representatives of Deutsche Bank then reviewed and discussed with the Headwaters Board of Directors certain financial analysis with respect to the consideration of
$24.25 per share of Headwaters common stock and rendered an oral opinion to the Board of Directors, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated November 20, 2016, to
the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations, qualifications and
conditions on the review undertaken in connection therewith, as described in Deutsche Bank's opinion, the consideration of $24.25 in cash per share of Headwaters common
stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Headwaters' common stock (other than Boral and its affiliates). Deutsche Bank did not express any opinion with
respect to the additional consideration that may be payable in the form of the "ticking fee." Following additional discussion and deliberation, the Headwaters Board unanimously
(i) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement, (ii) determined that entering into the merger agreement was in the best interests of Headwaters
and its stockholders, (iii) declared the merger agreement advisable and (iv) recommended that stockholders adopt the merger agreement.

        Following the meeting of the Headwaters Board on November 19, 2016, Mr. Benson notified Mr. Kane that the Headwaters Board of directors had agreed to Boral's
proposed "ticking fee" mechanism. Later on November 19 and November 20, the parties worked to negotiate and finalize the merger agreement.

        On November 20, 2016, Headwaters and Boral executed the merger agreement and issued a joint press release announcing the transaction.

Reasons for the Merger 

        In evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, the Board of Directors consulted with our senior
management, our financial advisor and our outside counsel. In the course of reaching its determination to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger, and to recommend that Headwaters' stockholders vote to approve the merger proposal, the Board of Directors considered many factors, both
positive and negative, and potential benefits and detriments of the merger to the Company and its stockholders. The Board of Directors believes that, taken as a whole, the
following factors supported its decision to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, which are not intended to be
exhaustive and are not presented in any relative order of importance:

Compelling Value; All Cash Consideration 

        The Board of Directors considered the fact that the consideration of $24.25 per share of our common stock represents a significant premium over the market prices at which
our common stock traded prior to the announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, including the fact that the merger consideration of $24.25 per share of our
common stock represented a premium of approximately:

• 21% over the $20.09 closing price per share of our common stock on November 18, 2016, the last trading day before our Board approved the transaction; 

• 36% over the 90-day volume weighted average price as of November 18, 2016; and 

• 16% over the high closing price of our common stock over the 12 months ended November 18, 2016 of $20.92.

        The Board of Directors also considered the certainty of value and liquidity for our stockholders provided by the fact that the merger consideration is all cash and at a fixed
price, as well as the potential for additional consideration should the closing of the merger not occur by September 1, 2017 due to certain closing conditions based upon
regulatory approvals not being satisfied.

Financial and Business Position 

        The Board of Directors considered the current and prospective conditions of the building products and construction materials industries and the challenges that the company
and its competitors may face, including the past and potential future growth rate of the company's businesses and the potential impact of increased competition and economic,
regulatory and other factors. The Board of Directors also considered the historical, current and prospective financial condition, results of operations and business and strategic
objectives of the company and the risk-adjusted probabilities associated with achieving the company's stand-alone plan.

Strategic Alternatives 

        The Board of Directors considered the strategic process undertaken by the company over several years prior to execution of the merger agreement, in consultation with its
financial and legal advisors, including the fact that the Board of Directors and the company's management had evaluated and considered strategic alternatives including:
(1) maintaining the company as a stand-alone entity with focus on internal growth and potential acquisitions of other businesses to increase the company's scale, (2) potential
mergers or other business combinations with other participants in the building products industry and the construction materials industry, and the associated limitations on any
such merger transactions given the company's two distinct businesses, (3) a potential sale of the entire company, and the limited number of other companies that may be
interested in buying the entirety of Headwaters given the two distinct building products and construction materials businesses, (4) potential divestiture,

spin-off, or sale of the company's building products and construction materials businesses and (5) potential transactions utilizing a "reverse Morris trust" structure. From
approximately 2011 to 2016, with assistance from the company's financial advisor, the company had approached in excess of 10 participants in the building products and
construction materials industries with respect to potential strategic transactions. As a result of the review of the company's strategic alternatives, the lack of any interested party to
buy the entirety of the company other than Boral, and the Board of Directors' belief that stockholder value would be maximized by a potential sale of the entirety of Headwaters,
as opposed to the sale of a portion of Headwaters or the separation and subsequent sale of the building products and construction materials businesses, the Board of Directors
authorized the company's management team to structure negotiations to maximize the likelihood of obtaining Boral's best proposal and to improve the terms of that proposal,
with particular focus on maximizing the consideration payable to the company's stockholders and financial protection in the event the transaction were not consummated. Further,
the Board of Directors, after consultation with representatives of the company's financial advisor and legal advisor, believes the terms of the merger agreement provide an
adequate opportunity for alternative proposals by other potential buyers to be made and for the Board of Directors to consider such alternative proposals, if any. The Board of
Directors also determined that the termination fee to be paid by the company to Boral under certain circumstances involving a "superior proposal" was reasonable and would not
likely deter alternative acquisition proposals.

Negotiations with Boral 

        The Board of Directors considered that the course of negotiations with Boral, which were conducted at arm's length and during which the Board of Directors was advised by
independent legal and financial advisors, resulted in an increase in the price per share from what Boral offered in its initial indication of interest on August 12, 2016, as well as
other enhancements to the terms of the transaction. The Board of Directors believed, based on these negotiations, that the company had obtained the most favorable terms to the
company and its stockholders on which Boral was willing to transact.

Likelihood of Completion; No Financing Condition 

        The Board of Directors considered the likelihood that the merger will be completed, including, among other things, the probability of receiving regulatory and stockholder
approval, the other limited and otherwise customary conditions to the parties' obligations to complete the merger, the fact that the transaction is not conditioned on Boral's receipt
of financing and that Boral will have sufficient financial resources to pay the aggregate merger consideration and complete the merger and the fact that the merger is not subject
to approval by Boral's stockholders. The Board of Directors further considered the likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals and Boral's covenants and commitments
to obtain such approvals, including its divestiture commitments, and the reverse termination fee payable to the company in the event regulatory approval is not obtained, all after
consultation with the company's legal advisors. In addition, the Board of Directors considered Boral's business reputation and experience in structuring and completing
transactions.

Opinion of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. 

        The Board of Directors considered the financial analysis presented by representatives of Deutsche Bank on November 19, 2016, and the oral opinion to the Board of
Directors, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated November 20, 2016, to the effect that as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations, qualifications and conditions on the review undertaken in connection therewith, as described in Deutsche Bank's
opinion, the consideration of $24.25 in cash per share of Headwaters common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Headwaters common stock (other
than Boral

and its affiliates). Deutsche Bank did not express any opinion with respect to the additional consideration, if any. The Board of Directors also considered that Deutsche Bank was
entitled to receive a fee upon delivery of its opinion (or would have been entitled to such fee if Deutsche Bank had advised the Board of Directors that it was unable to render its
opinion) and that, upon the closing of the merger, Deutsche Bank should become entitled to a success fee.

Terms of the Merger Agreement 

        The Board of Directors considered the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including:

• the limited number and nature of the conditions to complete the merger; 

• the customary nature of the representations, warranties and covenants of the company in the merger agreement; 

• the customary nature of the interim operating covenants, which restrict the conduct of the company's business prior to the completion of the merger, and the
exceptions to such covenants; 

• the covenants to undertake efforts to obtain regulatory approvals including the commitment by Boral to use reasonable best efforts to obtain applicable
competition law approvals, subject to certain divestiture limitations, and the regulatory termination fee of $75 million payable to Headwaters by Boral if the
merger is not completed due to a failure to satisfy certain regulatory closing conditions; 

• the Company's ability, subject to certain requirements and limitations, to provide confidential information to, and to respond to, a third party in connection with an
unsolicited alternative proposal made by such third party; 

• the Board of Directors' right, after complying with the terms of the merger agreement, to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an agreement with
respect to a superior proposal, upon payment of a termination fee of $65 million; 

• the Board of Directors' right, subject to certain requirements and limitations, to change its recommendation that the stockholders adopt the merger agreement
following the occurrence of an intervening event; and 

• the company's ability to seek specific enforcement of Boral's obligations under the merger agreement, including Boral's obligation to complete the merger under
certain circumstances, or to seek to recover damages for a willful breach (as described below under Terms of the Merger Agreement—Effect of Termination on
page 95) of the merger agreement under certain circumstances.

Availability of Appraisal Rights 

        The Board of Directors considered the fact that our stockholders are entitled under Section 262 of the DGCL to exercise appraisal rights with respect to the merger, allowing
such stockholders who have properly demanded and exercised appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL to seek a determination of the fair value of their shares by a court
of competent jurisdiction.

        The Board of Directors also considered a variety of risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the merger and the merger agreement, including the following:

No Stockholder Participation in Future Growth or Earnings 

        The Board of Directors considered the fact that the nature of the transaction as an all cash transaction would, after the closing of the merger, prevent our stockholders from
participating in any future earnings or growth of our business, and our stockholders would not benefit from any potential future appreciation in the value of our common stock.

Table of Contents

Consideration Taxable 

        The Board of Directors considered the fact that the receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for shares of Headwaters common stock pursuant to the merger generally
will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Effect of Failure to Complete the Transaction 

        While the Board of Directors expects that the merger will be completed, the Board of Directors considered that there can be no assurance that the required stockholder
approval will be obtained or that all of the conditions to the completion of the merger will be satisfied or waived or that the merger will receive required regulatory approvals,
and, as a result, it is possible that the merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, even if the merger proposal is approved by our stockholders. The Board of
Directors also considered potential negative effects if the merger proposal were not completed, including that:

• the trading price of the company's common stock could be adversely affected; 

• the company would have incurred significant transaction and opportunity costs, attempting to complete the merger; 

• there could be an adverse impact on the company's relationships with its customers, suppliers, business partners and employees; 

• the company's business may be subject to significant disruption and decline; 

• the market's perceptions of the company's prospects could be adversely affected; and 

• the company's directors, officers, and other employees would have expended considerable time and effort to negotiate, implement and complete the merger, and
their time may have been diverted from other important business opportunities and operational matters while working to implement the merger.

Effect of Public Announcement 

        The Board of Directors considered the potential impact of a public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement on the company's operations, stock price and
employees, our ability to retain key employees, our ability to effectively recruit replacement personnel while the merger is pending if needed and the potential adverse effects on
the company's financial results as a result of any related disruption in its business.

Regulatory Matters 

        The Board of Directors considered the possibility of costs and delays resulting from seeking regulatory approvals necessary to complete the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, the possibility that the merger may not be completed if such approvals are not obtained.

Flexibility to Operate the Business 

        The Board of Directors considered the covenants restricting operations of the Company between signing and completion, which contemplate that the Company will operate
only in the ordinary course of business and impose specified restrictions on the Company's business, which (notwithstanding certain exceptions to such restrictions) could delay
or prevent the company from taking advantage of certain business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger and that may adversely impact the company's
ability to respond to changing market and business conditions in a timely manner or at all.

Table of Contents

No Solicitation 

        The Board of Directors considered the fact that, following execution of the merger agreement, it would not be permitted to solicit alternative transaction proposals regarding
a business combination.

Termination Fees 

        The Board of Directors considered the fact that, under certain circumstances, the company may be required to pay Boral a termination fee of $65 million or, in the event the
transaction is terminated due to the inability to obtain Company stockholder approval for the proposed merger, to reimburse Boral's expenses (subject to certain limitations). The
Board of Directors considered the potential for such termination fee to discourage other potential acquirers from making a competing offer for the company (but, as noted above,
the Board of Directors determined that the termination fee was reasonable and would not likely deter alternative acquisition proposals).

Interests of the Board of Directors and Management 

        The Board of Directors considered that the directors and executive officers have interests in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement described in the section
titled "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger" beginning on page 57 of this proxy statement that may be different
from, or in addition to, those of other stockholders.

Recommendation of Our Board of Directors

        After considering various reasons to approve the merger agreement, as well as certain countervailing factors, the Board of Directors unanimously determined the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, to be advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Headwaters and its stockholders, and
unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Certain factors considered by the Board of Directors
in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger can be found in the section titled "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Reasons for the
Merger" beginning on page 44 of this proxy statement.

        The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the merger proposal, thereby approving the transactions contemplated thereby, including
the merger.

Opinion of Headwaters' Financial Advisor 

        At the November 19, 2016 meeting of the Board of Directors, Deutsche Bank, financial advisor to Headwaters, rendered its oral opinion to the Board of Directors,
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated November 20, 2016, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations, qualifications and conditions on the review undertaken in connection therewith, as described in Deutsche Bank's
opinion, the consideration of $24.25 in cash per share of Headwaters common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Headwaters common stock (other
than Boral and its affiliates). Deutsche Bank did not express any opinion with respect to the additional consideration, if any.

        The full text of Deutsche Bank's written opinion, dated November 20, 2016, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations, qualifications and conditions on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and is incorporated
herein by reference (the "opinion"). The summary of Deutsche Bank's opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
the opinion. Deutsche Bank's opinion was approved and authorized for issuance by a

Deutsche Bank fairness opinion review committee and was addressed to, and for the use and benefit of, the Board of Directors in connection with and for the purpose
of its evaluation of the merger. Deutsche Bank's opinion was limited to the fairness of the consideration of $24.25 in cash per share, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of Headwaters common stock (other than Boral and its affiliates) as of the date of the opinion. The opinion did not address any other terms of the merger
or the merger agreement. Headwaters did not ask Deutsche Bank to, and Deutsche Bank's opinion did not, address the fairness of the merger, or any consideration
received in connection therewith, to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Headwaters, nor did it address the fairness of the
contemplated benefits of the merger. Deutsche Bank expressed no opinion as to the merits of the underlying decision by Headwaters to engage in the merger or the
relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative transactions or business strategies. Nor did Deutsche Bank express an opinion, and Deutsche Bank's
opinion does not constitute a recommendation, as to how any holder of shares of Headwaters common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.
In addition, Deutsche Bank did not express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or to
be received by any of the officers, directors or employees of Headwaters, or any class of such persons, in connection with the merger, whether relative to the
consideration of $24.25 in cash per share or otherwise.

        No limitations were imposed by the Board of Directors upon Deutsche Bank with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it in rendering its opinion. In
connection with its role as financial advisor to Headwaters, and in arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Bank reviewed certain publicly available financial and other information
concerning Headwaters and certain internal analyses, financial forecasts and other information relating to Headwaters prepared by management of Headwaters, including the
Headwaters management projections summarized under "—Certain Financial Projections by Headwaters' Management" on page 69. Deutsche Bank also held discussions with
certain senior officers of Headwaters regarding the businesses and prospects of Headwaters. In addition, Deutsche Bank:

• reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Headwaters common stock; 

• compared certain financial and stock market information for Headwaters with, to the extent publicly available, similar information for certain other companies it
considered relevant whose securities are publicly traded; 

• reviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain recent business combinations which Deutsche Bank deemed relevant; 

• reviewed the merger agreement; and 

• performed such other studies and analyses and considered such other factors as Deutsche Bank deemed appropriate.

        Deutsche Bank did not assume responsibility for independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any information, whether publicly available or furnished to it,
concerning Headwaters, including, without limitation, any financial information considered in connection with the rendering of its opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of its
opinion, Deutsche Bank, with the knowledge and permission of the Board of Directors, assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information. Deutsche
Bank did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and did not prepare, obtain or review any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or
liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or off-balance-sheet assets or liabilities), of Headwaters, Boral or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor did Deutsche Bank
evaluate the solvency or fair value of Headwaters, Boral or the combined company under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. With respect to the
financial forecasts made available to Deutsche Bank and used in its analyses, Deutsche Bank assumed with the knowledge and permission of the Board of

Directors that such forecasts had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Headwaters as to the
matters covered thereby. In rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank expressed no view as to the reasonableness of such forecasts and projections or the assumptions on which they
were based. Deutsche Bank's opinion was necessarily based upon economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of
its opinion. Deutsche Bank expressly disclaimed any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting its opinion of which it becomes
aware after the date of its opinion.

        For purposes of rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank assumed, with the knowledge and permission of the Board of Directors, that in all respects material to its analysis, the
merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, without any waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement that
would be material to its analysis. Deutsche Bank also assumed, with the knowledge and permission of the Board of Directors, that all material governmental, regulatory or other
approvals and consents required in connection with the consummation of the merger will be obtained and that, in connection with obtaining any necessary governmental,
regulatory or other approvals and consents, no restrictions, terms or conditions will be imposed that would be material to its analysis. Deutsche Bank is not a legal, regulatory, tax
or accounting expert and has relied on the assessments made by Headwaters and its other advisors with respect to such issues.

        Headwaters selected Deutsche Bank as its financial advisor in connection with the merger based on Deutsche Bank's qualifications, expertise, reputation and experience in
mergers and acquisitions. Pursuant to an engagement letter between Headwaters and Deutsche Bank, dated November 10, 2016, Headwaters has agreed to pay Deutsche Bank a
fee estimated to be approximately $28 million for its services as financial advisor to Headwaters in connection with the merger, of which $1.5 million became payable upon
delivery of its opinion (or would have become payable if Deutsche Bank had advised the Board of Directors that it was unable to render its opinion) and the remainder of which
is contingent upon consummation of the merger. In addition, subject to the terms of the engagement letter, if the merger is not consummated, Headwaters has agreed to pay
Deutsche Bank a percentage of any payment to which it is entitled under the merger agreement in connection with the termination thereof. Headwaters has also agreed to
reimburse Deutsche Bank for reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel and Deutsche Bank's reasonable travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the merger or otherwise arising out of its engagement, in each case on the terms set forth in its engagement letter. Headwaters has also agreed to indemnify
Deutsche Bank and its affiliates against certain liabilities in connection with its engagement.

        Deutsche Bank is an internationally recognized investment banking firm experienced in providing advice in connection with mergers and acquisitions and related
transactions. Deutsche Bank is an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG (together with its affiliates, the "DB Group"). One or more members of the DB Group have, from time to time,
provided, and may be currently providing, financial services unrelated to the merger to Boral or its affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may receive,
compensation. The DB Group has received less than €50,000 in fees from Boral with respect to such services since January 1, 2014. One or more members of the DB Group
have, from time to time, provided, and are currently providing, investment banking, commercial banking (including extension of credit) and other financial services unrelated to
the merger to Headwaters or its affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may receive, compensation, including having acted as administrative agent, arranger and
bookrunner under Headwaters' $425 million term loan facility since March 2015, having acted as joint arranger and joint bookrunner with respect to a $350 million incremental
term loan facility in August 2016 and having acted as co-bookrunner with respect to an offering of Headwaters' 71/4% Senior Notes due 2019 (aggregate principal amount of
$150 million) in December 2013. The DB Group has received approximately $10.6 million in fees from Headwaters with respect to such services since January 1, 2014. The DB
Group may also provide investment and

commercial banking services to Boral, Headwaters and their respective affiliates in the future, for which we would expect the DB Group to receive compensation. In the ordinary
course of business, members of the DB Group may actively trade in the securities and other instruments and obligations of Boral, Headwaters and their respective affiliates for
their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. Accordingly, the DB Group may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, instruments and
obligations.

Summary of Material Financial Analyses of Deutsche Bank

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Deutsche Bank to the Board of Directors at its meeting held on November 19, 2016, and that
were used in connection with rendering its opinion described above.

        The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Deutsche Bank, nor does the order in which the
analyses are described below represent the relative importance or weight given to the analyses by Deutsche Bank. Some of the summaries of financial analyses below include
information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of Deutsche Bank's analyses. Considering the data described below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses,
including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following
quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before November 18, 2016, and is not necessarily indicative of
current market conditions.

        In preparing its analyses, Deutsche Bank utilized calculations of, among other things (i) total enterprise value ("TEV"), calculated as equity value plus, if applicable,
minority interest plus net debt, (ii) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), (iii) Adjusted EBITDA (calculated as described in "Proposal No. 1
—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Certain Financial Projections by Headwaters' Management" on page 69 of this proxy statement) and (iv) earnings per share ("EPS"). For
additional information regarding the financial data provided by management of Headwaters underlying these calculations, please see "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger
Agreement—Certain Financial Projections by Headwaters' Management" on page 69 of this proxy statement.

Selected Companies Analysis

        Deutsche Bank reviewed and compared certain financial information and commonly used valuation measurements for Headwaters with corresponding financial information
and valuation measurements for the following publicly traded companies in the building products and heavy construction materials industries.

        Although none of the above selected companies is directly comparable to Headwaters, for the purpose of selecting the companies for this analysis, Deutsche Bank utilized its
professional judgment and experience as investment bankers, taking into account several factors, including, among other things, Headwaters' operational capabilities and
financial profile compared with those of the selected companies, the competitive landscape in which Headwaters and the selected companies operate and Headwaters' product
offerings and those of the selected companies. Accordingly, the analysis of publicly traded comparable companies was not simply mathematical. Rather, it involved complex
considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in the opinion of Deutsche Bank, concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the selected companies
and other factors that could affect the public trading value of such companies.

        Based on the closing prices of the common stock or common equity of each of the selected companies on November 18, 2016, information contained in the most recent
public filings of the selected companies and analyst consensus estimates of EBITDA for calendar years 2016 and 2017 for each of the selected companies, Deutsche Bank
calculated the following multiples with respect to each of the selected companies:

• TEV as a multiple of calendar years 2016 and 2017 estimated Adjusted EBITDA; and 

• Price as a multiple of calendar year 2017 estimated EPS.

        Deutsche Bank also calculated the same multiples for Headwaters based upon (i) Headwaters' estimated calendar 2016 Adjusted EBITDA, pro forma for the acquisition of
Krestmark Industries, calculated by adding 75% of the actual results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 with 25% of Headwaters management's projected results for
fiscal 2017 and (ii) estimated calendar 2017 EPS, respectively.

        The results of this analysis are summarized as follows:

        Deutsche Bank also calculated that the multiple of TEV to Headwaters' pro forma calendar 2016 EBITDA taking into account the impact of its acquisition of Krestmark
Industries in August 2016 was 10.0x and that the multiple of price to Headwaters' estimated adjusted EPS for calendar 2017, adjusted for tax-affected amortization expense, was
14.2x.

        Deutsche Bank noted that one of Headwaters' primary products is fly ash, which is a substitute for cement in making ready mix concrete and that cement companies were
more comparable to Headwaters than aggregates companies, because aggregates tend to have unique pricing related dynamics throughout the construction cycle due to reliance
on local supply dynamics and attractiveness of industry structure. Deutsche Bank noted that, as a result, aggregates companies have historically traded at a significant premium to
cement companies. Accordingly, Deutsche Bank excluded from the construction materials selected companies those companies that it viewed to be more pure-play aggregates
companies.

        Based in part upon the multiples of the selected companies described above and taking into account its professional judgment and experience, Deutsche Bank calculated the
following ranges of implied values per share of Headwaters common stock on a fully diluted basis:

• approximately $17.80 to $22.60 per share of Headwaters common stock by applying multiples of TEV to estimated fiscal year 2017 EBITDA of 8.5x to 10.0x to
Headwaters management estimates of fiscal year 2017 EBITDA; and 

• approximately $16.60 to $22.10 per share of Headwaters common stock by applying multiples of 15.0x to 20.0x to Headwaters management estimates of EPS for
fiscal year 2017.

Selected Transactions Analysis

        Deutsche Bank reviewed publicly available information relating to the following 19 selected transactions involving building products and heavy construction materials
companies announced since November 2, 2009 (the "selected transactions").

        Although none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the merger, the companies that participated in the selected transactions were selected by Deutsche Bank
based upon its professional judgment and experience as investment bankers and its knowledge of transactions of a similar nature and are such that, for purposes of analysis, the
selected transactions may be considered similar to the merger.

        With respect to each selected transaction and based on publicly available information, Deutsche Bank calculated the multiples of the target's TEV to last 12 months (or
"LTM") EBITDA, in each case pro forma for acquisitions or divestitures, as of the date the transaction was announced, provided, that in the case of (i) the Marazzi Group
transaction, the multiple represented TEV to estimated EBITDA for fiscal year 2012; (ii) the Lafarge North American Gypsum assets transaction, the multiple represented TEV
to eleven months trailing EBITDA as of August 30, 2013; (iii) the Simonton Windows and Air Distribution Technologies transactions, the multiple represented TEV to estimated
EBITDA

for fiscal year 2014; (iv) in the case of the C.R. Laurence and WinDoor transactions, the multiple represented TEV to estimated EBITDA for fiscal year 2015; and (v) the
American Standard transaction, the multiple represented TEV to EBITDA for fiscal year 2012.

        Deutsche Bank also calculated the same multiples for the merger based upon Headwaters' LTM pro forma EBITDA as of September 30, 2016 taking into account its
acquisition of Krestmark Industries in August 2016 and the merger consideration of $24.25 in cash per share of Headwaters common stock.

        The results of this analysis are summarized as follows:

        Based in part upon the multiples of the selected transactions described above, and taking into account its professional judgment and experience, Deutsche Bank calculated
ranges of estimated implied values per share of Headwaters common stock by applying multiples of 10.0x to 12.0x to fiscal 2016 pro forma EBITDA provided by management
of Headwaters, resulting in a range of implied values of approximately $19.20 to $24.90 per share of Headwaters common stock.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Deutsche Bank performed a discounted cash flow analysis to determine a range of implied net present values per share of Headwaters common stock. Deutsche Bank
applied discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 10.5% to estimates of the future unlevered free cash flows of Headwaters for the period September 30, 2016 through September 30,
2021 (see Management Projections table on page 71), and to a range of estimated terminal values for Headwaters at the end of such period based upon Headwaters' management
projections to determine a range of implied enterprise values for Headwaters as of September 30, 2016. For purposes of its financial analyses, Deutsche Bank calculated
unlevered free cash flow as (a) earnings before interest and taxes (or "EBIT") less, (b) cash taxes, plus (c) depreciation and amortization, less (d) capital expenditures, less
(e) change in working capital. Deutsche Bank derived the foregoing range of discount rates utilizing a weighted average cost of capital analysis based on certain financial metrics
for Headwaters. The terminal values were calculated by applying a range of terminal EBITDA multiples of 8.0x to 9.0x (implying a perpetuity growth rate of 2.2% to 4.3%) to
calculate total terminal value. Deutsche Bank then subtracted Headwaters estimated net debt and non-cash interest and added the net present value of Headwaters' tax attributes
and divided the result by the number of fully diluted shares of Headwaters common stock outstanding using the treasury method. This analysis resulted in a range of implied
present values of Headwaters common stock as of September 30, 2016 of approximately $20.70 to $23.30 per share.

Other Information

        Deutsche Bank also noted for the Board of Directors certain additional factors that were not considered part of its financial analysis with respect to its opinion but were
referenced for informational purposes.

        Specifically, Deutsche Bank reviewed the historical trading prices for Headwaters common stock during the 52-week period ended November 18, 2016. Deutsche Bank
noted that the closing prices for Headwaters common stock during such period ranged from a low of $14.20 per share as of January 27, 2016 to a high of $20.90 per share as of
April 27, 2016. Deutsche Bank also noted that the consideration of $24.25 in cash per share represented a premium of 21% to the closing price of $20.09 per share of Headwaters
common stock on November 18, 2016, a premium of 36% to the three month volume weighted average trading price per share of Headwaters common stock as of November 18,
2016 and a premium of 16% to the twelve-month high closing price per share of Headwaters common stock of $20.92 on April 27, 2016.

        Deutsche Bank also reviewed the stock price targets for shares of Headwaters common stock in nine publicly available research analysts' reports published in the first week
of November 2016, which indicated low and high stock price targets ranging from $20.00 to $24.00 per share for the eight reports which included stock price targets.

Miscellaneous 

        This summary is not a complete description of Deutsche Bank's opinion or the underlying analyses and factors considered in connection with Deutsche Bank's opinion. The
preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving the application of subjective business and financial judgment in determining the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. Deutsche Bank believes that its analyses described above must be considered as a whole and that considering any portion of such analyses and of the factors
considered without considering all analyses and factors could create a misleading view of the process underlying its opinion. Selecting portions of the analyses or summary set
forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the Deutsche Bank opinion. In arriving at its fairness
determination, Deutsche Bank considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis. Rather, it made its fairness
determination on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction in the analyses described
above is identical to Headwaters or the merger.

        In conducting its analyses and arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Bank utilized a variety of generally accepted valuation methods. The analyses were prepared solely for the
purpose of enabling Deutsche Bank to provide its opinion to the Board of Directors as to the fairness of the consideration of $24.25 in cash per share, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Headwaters common stock (other than Boral and its affiliates) as of the date of the opinion and do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the
prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold, which are inherently subject to uncertainty. As described above, in connection with its analyses, Deutsche Bank
made, and was provided by the management of Headwaters with, numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Deutsche Bank or Headwaters. Analyses based on estimates or forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of
actual, past or future values or results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Because such analyses are inherently subject to
uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of Headwaters or its respective advisors, Deutsche Bank does not assume responsibility if future
results or actual values are materially different from these forecasts or assumptions.

        The terms of the merger, including the merger consideration, were determined through arm's-length negotiations between Headwaters and Boral and were approved by the
Board of Directors. Although Deutsche Bank provided advice to the Board of Directors during the course of these negotiations, the decision to enter into the merger agreement
was solely that of the Board of Directors.

Table of Contents

Deutsche Bank did not recommend any specific consideration to Headwaters or the Board of Directors, or that any specific amount or type of consideration constituted the only
appropriate consideration for the transaction. As described above, the opinion of Deutsche Bank and its presentation to the Board of Directors were among a number of factors
taken into consideration by the Board of Directors in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder.

Delisting and Deregistration of Our Common Stock 

        Headwaters common stock is registered as a class of equity securities under the Exchange Act and is quoted on the NYSE under the symbol "HW." As a result of the merger,
we will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Boral, with no public market for our common stock. After the merger, our common stock will cease to be traded on the
NYSE, and price quotations with respect to sales of shares of our common stock in the public market will no longer be available. In addition, the registration of our common
stock under the Exchange Act will be terminated and we will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC after the effective time of the merger.

Financing of the Merger 

        The merger is not conditioned on Boral obtaining the proceeds of any financing. Boral currently expects to finance the merger by way of (i) its recently completed offer of
Boral equity securities which raised approximately AUD$2.05 billion, (ii) USD$0.8 billion of debt from a committed bridge acquisition facility and (iii) existing cash on Boral's
balance sheet.

        The offer included an institutional component and a retail component. As at the date of this proxy statement, the offer has been completed, and raised approximately
AUD$2.05 billion.

        Concurrently with the signing of the merger agreement, Boral also entered into the bridge facility agreement. The ability of Boral to request the making of loans from the
bridge lenders under the bridge facility agreement is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of certain conditions set forth therein and the bridge facility agreement contains
representations and warranties, affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default usual for a facility of this nature.

        We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be approximately
$2.5 billion. These funds include the funds needed to:

• pay our stockholders (including equity award holders) the amount due under the merger agreement; 

• refinance or repay certain of our outstanding indebtedness, including our existing senior secured loan and revolving credit facilities; and 

• pay customary fees and expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Interests of Certain Persons in the Merger

        In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, approving the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests
of our stockholders generally. The members of the Board of Directors were aware of the different or additional interests and considered these interests, among other matters, in
evaluating and overseeing the negotiation of the merger agreement

and the merger, and in recommending to our stockholders that they approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, approving the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the merger.

        Certain of these interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the narrative below and under the heading "Proposal No. 2—Advisory
Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation" beginning on page 98 of this proxy statement. Further, this section includes disclosure with respect to William
E. Robinson, Jr., President of Headwaters Windows Division, and Brent A. Spann, President of Headwaters Stone Division. Neither Mr. Robinson nor Mr. Spann is a named
executive officer for purposes of SEC rules and therefore neither is subject to the non-binding advisory vote of Headwaters' stockholders, as described below in "Proposal No. 2
—Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation" beginning on page 103 of this proxy statement. The dates used in this proxy statement to
determine the amount of these interests have been selected for illustrative purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the dates on which certain events will occur.

Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards 

Stock Options

        At the effective time of the merger, each Headwaters stock option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will
be canceled, without action of the holder, and the holder thereof will be entitled only to receive a cash payment, without interest, in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the
merger consideration over the applicable exercise price for each share of Headwaters common stock subject to such Headwaters stock option; provided, however, that if the
exercise price per share of Headwaters common stock equals or exceeds the merger consideration, the amount payable for such Headwaters stock option will be $0.00.

Stock Appreciation Rights

        At the effective time of the merger, each Headwaters stock appreciation right, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will be canceled, without action of the holder, and the holder thereof will be entitled only to receive a cash payment, without interest, in an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of the merger consideration over the applicable base price for each share of Headwaters common stock subject to such Headwaters stock appreciation right; provided,
however, that if the base price per share of Headwaters common stock equals or exceeds the merger consideration, the amount payable for such Headwaters stock appreciation
right will be $0.00.

Restricted Shares

        At the effective time of the merger, each unvested Headwaters restricted share that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be canceled,
without action of the holder, and the holder thereof will be entitled only to receive a cash payment, without interest, in an amount equal to the merger consideration.

Restricted Stock Units

        At the effective time of the merger, each Headwaters restricted stock unit, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will be canceled, without action of the holder, and the holder thereof will be entitled only to receive a cash payment, without interest, in an amount equal to the merger
consideration.

Director Deferred Compensation Plan

        For any members of the Board of Directors, who elected to have amounts deferred under the Headwaters Director Deferred Compensation Plan deemed invested in
Headwaters common stock, (i) each share of Headwaters common stock purchased by Headwaters and held as treasury stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
in connection with such deferrals will be canceled in accordance with the merger agreement, and (ii) the director will be entitled to receive a cash payment, in respect of each
such share, without interest, in an amount equal to the merger consideration, subject to and payable in accordance with the terms of the Headwaters Director Deferred
Compensation Plan.

Amounts Payable on Settlement of Unvested Equity-Based Awards

        For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of Headwaters' named executive officers on settlement of their unvested equity-based awards, see "Proposal
No. 2—Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named Executive Officer Compensation" below. The estimated aggregate amount that would be payable to Headwaters' executive
officers who are not named executive officers in settlement of their unvested equity-based awards if the merger were completed before September 30, 2017, and with respect to
such executives assuming there had been a termination of employment at the same time as a result of a resignation by the executive due to a constructive termination or a
termination by the surviving company without cause, is $92,033.

Transition Award Plans

        Headwaters has implemented change of control agreements and performance unit awards to incentivize executive officers in connection with the transition aspects of the
merger. First, all executive officers have a change in control agreement. These agreements provide for (i) severance upon a "double-trigger" qualifying termination of the officer's
employment (except in the case of two executive officers with direct operating responsibilities, for whom there is a "single-trigger" or incentive payment due regardless of
continued employment no later than 36 months after the merger), equal to two times the sum of (x) the executive officer's base salary in effect as of the date of termination of
employment or, if higher, the salary actually paid for either of the two preceding completed fiscal years, and (y) the executive officer's actual or target bonus for the fiscal year in
which the termination of employment occurs or, if higher, the bonus actually paid for either of the two preceding completed fiscal years, (ii) payment for the sum of the prior
fiscal years' cash-based performance unit awards that have been earned and accrued but remain unvested and unpaid as of the termination date, plus the current fiscal year's target
cash-based performance unit award amount adjusted, in the instance of the current year only, for the current fiscal year's financial performance through the termination date,
(iii) acceleration of the vesting of the unvested equity awards that would occur at the effective time of the merger, and (iv) certain other benefits upon a "double-trigger"
qualifying termination for all executive officers, consisting of continuation of auto allowance benefits and continuation of health, life and related insurance benefits, for two
years, all in accordance with the terms and conditions of each named executive officer's Change in Control agreement.

        A second arrangement to incentivize executive officers to and through the closing of the merger is performance unit awards. For 2017, the performance unit award goals are
based on achievement of budgeted adjusted EBITDA by each business unit, for which performance will be measured at the end of the fiscal year or if sooner, as of the end of the
month before the merger. Awards will be payable 50 percent at the time of the merger and 50 percent six months following the merger, unless employment is terminated between
the time of the merger and six months following the merger, causing payment to become due upon termination.

Table of Contents

        The potential compensation to each named executive officer is provided in more detail under the heading "Proposal No. 2—Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Named
Executive Compensation" beginning on page 98.

        If the merger is completed before September 30, 2017, Mr. Spann will be entitled to receive compensation in the amount of $1,444,450. If the merger is completed before
September 30, 2017 and there is a subsequent qualifying termination of employment, Mr. Robinson will be entitled to receive compensation in the amount of $510,738.

Employee Benefits 

        The merger agreement requires Boral to cause the surviving company to honor, in accordance with their terms, all written employment, change in control and severance
agreements or other similar compensation plans between Headwaters or its subsidiary and any employee, former employee or director, or any group of employees or directors, of
Headwaters or its subsidiary, that were in effect, or as approved by the Board of Directors prior to, or as of the date of the merger agreement. Boral has also agreed to continue to
provide certain compensation and benefits for specified periods following the effective time of the merger. For a detailed description of these requirements, please see the section
titled "Terms of the Merger Agreement—Employees and Employee Benefits" beginning on page 89 of this proxy statement.

Indemnification and Insurance 

        Headwaters is party to indemnity agreements with each of its directors and executive officers that require Headwaters, among other things, to indemnify the directors and
executive officers against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or executive officers. These indemnity agreements will be assumed by
the surviving company in the merger, without any further action, and will survive the merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. In addition,
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, our directors and executive officers may be entitled to certain indemnification and an extension of coverage under directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section titled "Terms of the Merger Agreement—Directors' and
Officers' Indemnification and Insurance" beginning on page 90 of this proxy statement.

Voting Agreement 

        Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, Kirk A. Benson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, entered into the voting agreement with Boral,
pursuant to which Mr. Benson is, among other things:

• required to vote: (1) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and in favor of each of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement for
which approval of our stockholders is solicited; (2) against approval of any proposal made in opposition to, or in competition with, consummation of the merger
or any other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and (3) against certain actions (other than those actions that relate to the merger and any other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement) described in the voting agreement; and 

• prohibited from transferring his shares of our common stock, subject to limited exceptions described in the voting agreement (including permitting Mr. Benson to
transfer up to 50,000 shares of our common stock without restriction).

        The voting agreement terminates upon, among other things, a termination of the merger agreement. As of December 23, 2016, Mr. Benson is entitled to vote approximately
1,575,665 shares of

        This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the voting agreement, which is attached to the proxy statement as Annex B and incorporated into
this proxy statement by reference.

Regulatory Matters 

        As described in "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Regulatory Matters" beginning on page 61 of this proxy statement, each party has agreed to prepare
and file as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, filings and other documents and to use reasonable best efforts to obtain, as
promptly as practicable, the required regulatory approvals in order to complete the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. It is possible
that the required regulatory approvals may not be obtained before stockholders vote on the merger agreement.

        The merger is subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which
we refer to as the HSR Act. The HSR Act provides for an initial 30 calendar day waiting period following the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's, which we refer to as the FTC,
and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice's, which we refer to as the Antitrust Division, receipt of both parties' Premerger Notification and Report Forms
before the parties may consummate the merger. Boral and Headwaters each filed its respective Premerger Notification and Report Form with the FTC and the Antitrust Division.
The initial waiting period applicable to the merger will expire at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on January 6, 2017, unless the waiting period is earlier terminated by the FTC and the
Antitrust Division or extended by the issuance of a second request to Boral and Headwaters by the FTC or the Antitrust Division prior to that time. If, before expiration or early
termination of the initial 30 calendar day waiting period, either the FTC or the Antitrust Division issues a second request, the waiting period with respect to the merger will be
extended for an additional period of 30 calendar days following both parties' substantial compliance with that request unless earlier terminated by the FTC or the Antitrust
Division. After that time, the waiting period may be extended only by court order or with the consent of the parties. At any time before or after the consummation of any such
transactions, the FTC or the Antitrust Division could take such action under the antitrust laws of the U.S. as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including
seeking to enjoin the merger. Private parties (including individual States) may also bring legal actions under the antitrust laws of the U.S.

        The parties have also agreed to work cooperatively to file a joint voluntary notice with CFIUS. Upon the acceptance of such a notice, CFIUS will initiate a 30 calendar day
review period at the end of which, in the absence of any unresolved national security concerns, it will conclude all action under Section 721. If CFIUS determines that additional
review is required, it will commence a 45 calendar day investigation no later than the end of the initial 30 day review period. If at the end of the investigation CFIUS has no
unresolved national security concerns it will conclude all action under Section 721. At the conclusion of such investigation, if CFIUS has unresolved national security concerns,
it will send a report to the President who may act to suspend or prohibit the transaction. At any time during the course of CFIUS review or investigation, CFIUS may request that
the parties take actions to mitigate any national security concerns identified. Where CFIUS has completed all action with respect to the transaction or the President has announced
a decision not to exercise his authority under Section 721 with respect to the transaction, then the parties may enjoy a "safe harbor" against further action by the President or
CFIUS with respect to the transaction. The parties filed a draft notice with CFIUS on December 16, 2016.

        Boral is required to make a notification filing under the ICA to the Investment Review Division of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. While this
filing can be made subsequent to the completion of a transaction, the parties have agreed that Boral will make the filing prior to the completion of the transaction. This will
ensure that the 45 day period during which the Governor in Counsel could elect to commence a national security review under Part IV.1 of the ICA will expire prior to the
completion of the transaction. In the event that a national security review is commenced under the ICA, and the Governor in Counsel determines that the transaction could be
injurious to Canadian national security the transaction could be suspended or prohibited. At any time during a possible national security review, the Governor in Counsel may
request that Boral take actions to mitigate any national security concerns identified. If Boral does not receive a notice or order under Part IV.1 of the ICA within 45 days of the
submission of a completed notification filing, or in the event such notice has been sent or order made and Boral subsequently receives (i) notice that no review will be made with
respect to the transaction, (ii) notice that no further action will be taken with respect to the merger or (iii) an order authorizing the transaction, the transaction can be completed
under the ICA.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders and non-U.S. holders (each as defined below)
who receive cash in exchange for shares of Headwaters common stock pursuant to the merger. This discussion is for general informational purposes only and does not purport to
be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences of the merger. The tax consequences of the merger under U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to the income
tax, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local and non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion also does not address any tax consequences arising
under the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the "Code" in
this proxy statement, the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue
Service, which we refer to as the "IRS" in this proxy statement, in each case, in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing
interpretations, and any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth
in this summary. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding the tax consequences of the merger.

        This discussion is limited to holders of shares of Headwaters common stock who hold such shares as "capital assets" within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code
(generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder's
particular circumstances. In addition, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income
tax laws, including, without limitation:

• U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the U.S.; 

• persons subject to the alternative minimum tax; 

• U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; 

• persons holding shares of Headwaters common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other
integrated investment; 

• banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions; 

• brokers or dealers in securities; 

• traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting;

        If a partnership (or an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds shares of Headwaters common stock, the tax treatment of a
partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Accordingly, partnerships holding Headwaters common stock
and partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to them.

        THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. HOLDERS OF HEADWATERS COMMON STOCK
SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO THEM IN
LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF THE MEDICARE CONTRIBUTION TAX ON NET
INVESTMENT INCOME, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER ARISING UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS OTHER THAN
THOSE PERTAINING TO THE INCOME TAX, INCLUDING ESTATE OR GIFT TAX LAWS, OR UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS OR
UNDER ANY APPLICABLE INCOME TAX TREATY.

Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders 

Definition of a U.S. Holder

        For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. holder" is any beneficial owner of shares of Headwaters common stock that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is or is treated as:

• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the U.S.; 

• a corporation (or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized under the laws of the U.S., any state thereof or
the District of Columbia; 

• an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or 

• a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more "United States persons" (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Code) are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) has a valid election in effect to be treated as a "United States person" for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

Effect of the Merger

        The receipt of cash by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Headwaters common stock in the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder in connection therewith must be calculated separately for each block of shares of

Table of Contents

Headwaters common stock (that is, shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) exchanged for cash in the merger. The amount of any such gain or loss realized with
respect to each block of shares of Headwaters common stock generally will equal the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received for such shares and the U.S. holder's
adjusted tax basis in such shares. Any gain or loss realized by a U.S. holder upon the receipt of cash in exchange for a share of Headwaters common stock in the merger generally
will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held such share for more than one year at the effective time of merger. Otherwise, such
gain or loss will be short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, are generally taxable at a
reduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

        Payments made to a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Headwaters common stock pursuant to the merger may be subject to information reporting and may be subject to
backup withholding. To avoid backup withholding on such payments, U.S. holders that do not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return to the paying agent a
properly executed IRS Form W-9, certifying that such holder is a U.S. person, the taxpayer identification number provided is correct, and that such holder is not subject to backup
withholding. Certain holders (including corporations) are not subject to backup withholding or information reporting rules.

        Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holder's U.S.
federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for
an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.

Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders 

Definition of a Non-U.S. Holder

        For purposes of this discussion, a "non-U.S. holder" is a beneficial owner of shares of Headwaters common stock that is neither a U.S. holder nor an entity or arrangement
classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Effect of the Merger

        A non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized on the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Headwaters common stock in
the merger unless:

• the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder's conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, such
gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the U.S.); 

• the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition of shares of Headwaters
common stock in the merger, and certain other requirements are met; or 

• we are or have been a "United States real property holding corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes
at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the date of disposition or the non-U.S. holder's holding period for our common stock, and certain
other requirements are met.

        Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated U.S. federal income tax
rates, generally in the same manner as if such non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation also

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1003344/000104746916017319/a2230570zdefm14a.htm 73/221

Table of Contents

may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain, as
adjusted for certain items.

        Gain described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified under an
applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the U.S.),
provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.

        We do not believe that we are or have been a United States real property holding corporation. Even if we are treated as a United States real property holding corporation,
gain realized by a non-U.S. holder on a disposition of our common stock will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax so long as (1) the non-U.S. holder owned, directly,
indirectly and constructively, no more than five percent of our common stock at all times within the shorter of (x) the five-year period preceding the disposition or (y) the holder's
holding period and (2) our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market. If any gain on your disposition is taxable because we are a United States real
property holding corporation and your ownership of our common stock exceeds five percent, you will be taxed on such disposition generally in the manner applicable to U.S.
holders.

        Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

        Payments made to non-U.S. holders in the merger may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding. Non-U.S. holders generally can avoid backup
withholding and information reporting by providing the paying agent with the applicable and properly executed IRS Form W-8 certifying the holder's non-U.S. status or by
otherwise establishing an exemption. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may be made available under an applicable tax treaty or information exchange
agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under
the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a non-U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS.

Appraisal Rights 

        If the merger is completed, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger proposal and who properly demand appraisal of their shares and who do not
withdraw such demand or lose their right to appraisal will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.

        The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262,
which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and incorporated herein by reference. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does not
constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of Headwaters common stock is entitled to
demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder's name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Headwaters common stock held of record in the name of
another person, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in a timely manner to
perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of Headwaters common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should
consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee.

        Under Section 262, holders of shares of Headwaters common stock who (1) do not vote in favor of the merger proposal; (2) continuously hold such shares through the
effective time of the merger; and

(3) otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and to receive in lieu
of the merger consideration payment in cash of the amount determined by the Court of Chancery to be the "fair value" of the shares of Headwaters common stock, exclusive of
any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value as determined by
the court (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by the surviving company pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL).
Unless the Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound quarterly from the effective
time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such
period. Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the
same as or less than the $24.25 per share consideration payable pursuant to the merger agreement.

        Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than twenty days prior to the meeting,
must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes
Headwaters' notice to stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex D. In connection with the merger, any holder of shares of Headwaters' common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such holder's right
to do so should review Annex D carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights
under the DGCL. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all Headwaters stockholders who assert appraisal rights unless (x) the total
number of shares of common stock for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of Headwaters outstanding shares of common stock measured in
accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 of the DGCL or (y) the value of the merger consideration in respect of the shares of common stock for which appraisal rights have
been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million. Because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of Headwaters common stock,
Headwaters believes that if a stockholder is considering exercising appraisal rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.

        Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of Headwaters common stock must fully comply with Section 262, which means doing, among
other things, ALL of the following:

• the stockholder must not vote in favor of the merger proposal; 

• the stockholder must deliver to Headwaters a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting; 

• the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the merger (a stockholder will lose appraisal
rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the effective time); and 

• the stockholder or the surviving company must file a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware requesting a determination of the fair value of the
shares within 120 days after the effective time of the merger. The surviving company is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.

Filing Written Demand 

        Any holder of shares of Headwaters common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to Headwaters, before the vote on the merger proposal at the special
meeting, a written

66

Table of Contents

demand for the appraisal of the stockholder's shares, and that stockholder must not vote in favor of the merger proposal either in person or by proxy. A holder of shares of
Headwaters common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of
record through the effective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the merger proposal,
and it will cause a stockholder to lose the stockholder's right to appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who
submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the merger proposal or abstain from voting on the merger
proposal. However neither voting against the merger proposal nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the merger proposal will, in and of itself, constitute a written
demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the merger
proposal. A stockholder's failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the merger proposal at the special meeting will cause the stockholder to lose its
appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

        Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder's name. A demand for appraisal in respect of
shares of common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record and must reasonably inform Headwaters of the identity of the holder and state that the person
intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder's shares in connection with the merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian
or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, such as in a joint tenancy or a
tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may
execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand,
the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.

        STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER NOMINEES AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE
APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE
PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A
BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT
PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL
RIGHTS.

        All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

Headwaters Incorporated
10701 S River Front Parkway
Suite 300
South Jordan, Utah 84095
Attn: General Counsel

        Any holder of shares of Headwaters common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the merger consideration by delivering to Headwaters a
written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the effective time of the merger will require
written approval of the surviving company. No appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be dismissed without the approval of such court and
such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the court deems just.

Notice by the Surviving Company 

        If the merger is completed, within ten days after the Effective Time, the surviving company will notify each holder of shares of common stock who has made a written
demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 and who has not voted in favor of the merger proposal of the date that the merger has become effective.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal 

        Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving company or any holder of shares of Headwaters common stock who has demanded
appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, with a copy served on the
surviving company in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. A
beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name file a petition for appraisal. If a petition for
appraisal is not timely filed, then the right to an appraisal will cease. The surviving company is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file such a petition, and
holders should not assume that the surviving company will file a petition. Accordingly, any holders of shares of Headwaters common stock who desire to have their shares
appraised by the Court of Chancery should assume that they will be responsible for filing a petition for appraisal with the Court of Chancery in the manner prescribed in
Section 262. The failure of a holder of Headwaters common stock to file such a petition for appraisal within the period specified in Section 262 will nullify the stockholder's
previous written demand for appraisal.

        Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of Headwaters common stock who has complied with the requirements for the exercise of
appraisal rights, or a beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person, will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the
surviving company a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger proposal and with respect to which Headwaters received demands
for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving company must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within ten days after receipt of
the written request for such a statement or within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.

        If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of Headwaters common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving company, the surviving
company will then be obligated within twenty days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all
stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as
required by the court, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with
Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares to submit
their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the
Court of Chancery may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings.

Determination of Fair Value 

        After determining the holders of Headwaters common stock entitled to appraisal, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will appraise the "fair value" of the shares
of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value. In

Table of Contents

determining fair value, the Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that
could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in
the financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered, and that "[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value
of a company." Section 262 provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger."

        Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware could be
more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment
banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value
under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although Headwaters believes that the merger consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as
determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower
than, or the same as, the merger consideration. Each of Headwaters and Boral reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the "fair
value" of a share of Headwaters common stock is less than the $24.25 per share consideration.

        Unless the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective time through the date of
payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time
during the period between the effective time of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys' fees
or the fees and expenses of experts) may be determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and taxed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery deems equitable
under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection
with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to
be appraised.

        If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of Headwaters' common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or successfully withdraws, such
holder's right to appraisal, the stockholder's shares of common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the merger
consideration. From and after the effective time of the merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of Headwaters common
stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder's shares of Headwaters common
stock, if any, payable to stockholders as of a time prior to the effective time of the merger.

Certain Financial Projections by Headwaters' Management

        Headwaters does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance, earnings or other results beyond the current fiscal year given the
unpredictability of underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Headwaters' management provided internal non-public five-year financial forecasts regarding Headwaters'
anticipated future operations to the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the merger and to Deutsche Bank for its use. We refer to these internal non-public five-
year financial forecasts as the projections. The projections also were provided to Boral during its performance of due diligence in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

        The projections were prepared by and are the responsibility of Headwaters' management. The projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure.
Accordingly, the projections do not comply with published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for
preparation and presentation of financial forecasts, or generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). BDO USA, LLP, Headwaters' independent registered public
accounting firm, has not audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the projections and does not express an opinion on or any form of assurance
related to the projections. Headwaters included a summary of the projections in this section of the proxy statement for the benefit of its stockholders because Headwaters
provided such non-public information to the Board of Directors and financial advisor, and to Boral. However, the summary of the projections included in this proxy statement is
not intended to influence any Headwaters stockholder's decision of whether to vote its shares in favor of approval of the merger agreement.

        The projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and many of which are beyond the control of Headwaters. Among other
things, the projections included assumptions that housing starts would return to mid-cycle levels by 2020, as well as assumptions as to growth in the repair and remodeling
markets; fly ash volumes; pricing in the building products segment and construction materials segment; growth in fixed costs; revenue increases relative to increases in selling,
general and administrative expenses; Headwaters paying down its debt obligations to reduce leverage ratios; and Headwaters' effective income tax rate.

        Additionally, the projections are inherently forward-looking and span multiple years. Consequently, the projections, as with all forward-looking information, become subject
to greater unpredictability and uncertainty with each successive year. The assumptions upon which the projections were based necessarily involve judgments with respect to,
among other things, future economic, competitive and regulatory conditions and financial market conditions, all of which are difficult or impossible to predict or estimate and
most of which are beyond Headwaters' control. The projections also reflect assumptions regarding the continuing nature of certain business decisions that, in reality, would be
subject to change. Important factors that may affect actual results or the achievability of the projections include, but are not limited to, failure to implement Headwaters' business
strategy; failure to capitalize on Headwaters' expected opportunities; lack of customer acceptance of Headwaters' new products, product enhancements or new applications for
existing products; decreased demand for Headwaters' products; product liability claims exposure; regulatory developments related to CCPs; failure to otherwise comply with laws
and regulations; changes in general economic and business conditions; changes in credit markets and interest rates; and other risks and uncertainties described in Headwaters'
annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. In addition, the realization of the
results contemplated by the projections may be affected by Headwaters' ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable period. This information
constitutes "forward-looking statements" and actual results may differ materially and adversely from those projected. See the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Concerning
Forward-Looking Information" beginning on page 27 of this proxy statement.

        There can be no assurance that the projections will be realized and actual results may vary materially from those projected. The inclusion of a summary of the projections in
this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that Headwaters or any of its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives considered or consider the
projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events or results of Headwaters' operations, and, consequently, the projections should not be relied on in such a manner.
Neither Headwaters, Boral, nor any of their respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives can give any assurance that actual results will not differ from
the projections, and neither Headwaters, Boral, nor any of their respective affiliates undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the projections to reflect
circumstances existing or developments and events occurring after the date of the projections or that may occur in the future, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions
underlying the projections

are not realized. Headwaters does not intend to make available publicly any update or other revision to the projections, except as otherwise required by law. None of Headwaters
nor any of its affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation to any Headwaters stockholder or other person regarding the
ultimate performance of Headwaters compared to the information contained in the projections or that the projections will be achieved. Headwaters has not made any
representations to Boral in the merger agreement or otherwise, concerning the projections.

        In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the projections, Headwaters' stockholders are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the
information presented in the summary of the projections.

Management Projections 

        In this proxy statement, reference is made to Adjusted EBITDA, which is deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management,
investors and analysts to measure operating performance, as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is also
used by management, investors and analysts as one measure of a company's ability to service its debt and meet its other cash needs. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is
limited as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because the definition of Adjusted
EBITDA varies among companies and industries, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other
companies.

TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following summary describes certain material provisions of the merger agreement. This summary is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
merger agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read the merger agreement
carefully in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties
are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.

        Factual disclosures about Headwaters contained in this proxy statement or in Headwaters' public reports filed with the SEC may supplement, update or modify the factual
disclosures about Headwaters contained in the merger agreement and described in this summary. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below
and included in the merger agreement were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates, may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and
supplemental information agreed to by Headwaters, Boral and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement, including certain qualifications,
limitations and supplemental information disclosed in the confidential disclosure letters to the merger agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties were included
in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between Headwaters and Boral, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties
that differ from those applicable to investors. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the merger
agreement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of Headwaters, Boral and Merger Sub
because the parties to the merger agreement may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letters to the merger agreement or as
otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The merger agreement is described below, and attached as
Annex A hereto, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions. The representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the merger
agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding Headwaters and our
business. Please see "Where Stockholders Can Find More Information" beginning on page 109.

Structure of the Merger 

        On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will merge
with and into Headwaters. At the effective time of the merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and Headwaters will continue as the surviving company
in the merger.

Closing and the Effective Time of the Merger 

        The completion of the merger will take place on a date to be specified by Headwaters and Boral, which will be no later than the second business day following the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions to closing (described below under "Terms of the
Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Completion of the Merger" beginning on page 92) (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of those conditions); provided, however, that, notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
closing, in no event will the closing occur prior to the final day of the marketing period (or such date during the marketing period specified by Boral to Headwaters on no less
than two business days' written notice); or such other date and time as agreed to in writing by Boral and Headwaters. Subject to the provisions of the merger agreement, as soon
as practicable on the closing date, the parties will file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of merger relating to the merger

agree and specify in the certificate of merger.

Marketing Period 

        Subject to certain exceptions, the marketing period means the first period of 15 consecutive business days after the date of the merger agreement throughout and at the end
of which Boral shall have received certain required financial information from Headwaters (or such earlier date as Boral may specify in writing to Headwaters for the
commencement of the marketing period). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the marketing period will end on any earlier date that is the date on which the full amount of the
proceeds of Boral's financing (or any alternate financing) are obtained and (ii) if the marketing period has not ended prior to December 19, 2016, it will be deemed not to have
commenced until after January 2, 2017.

Directors and Officers; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws 

        The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the directors of the surviving company until the earlier of their death, resignation
or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of Headwaters immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
will be the officers of the surviving company until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified,

company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law, except that references to the name of Merger Sub will be replaced by references to the
name of the surviving company. The by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, will be the by-laws of the surviving company until

surviving company.

Merger Consideration 

Common Stock

        At the effective time of the merger, each share of Headwaters common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to such time (other than excluded shares) will be
converted into the right to receive (x) $24.25 in cash, without interest, and (y) the additional consideration, if any. All such shares of Headwaters common stock, when so
converted, will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist. The right of any holder of Headwaters common stock to receive the merger
consideration will be subject to and reduced by the amount of any required withholding under applicable tax law.

Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards

        Stock Options.    At the effective time of the merger, each Headwaters stock option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of

if any, of the merger consideration over the applicable exercise price for each share of Headwaters common stock subject to such Headwaters stock option; provided, however,
that if the exercise price per share of Headwaters common stock equals or exceeds the merger consideration, the amount payable for such Headwaters stock option will be $0.00.

        Stock Appreciation Rights.    At the effective time of the merger, each Headwaters stock appreciation right, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger will be canceled, without action of the holder, and the holder thereof will be entitled only to receive a cash payment, without interest, in an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the applicable base price for each share of Headwaters common stock subject to such Headwaters stock
appreciation right; provided, however, that if the base price per share of Headwaters common stock equals or exceeds the merger consideration, the amount payable for such
Headwaters stock appreciation right will be $0.00.

        Restricted Shares.    At the effective time of the merger, each unvested Headwaters restricted share that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger

equal to the merger consideration.

        Director Deferred Compensation Plan.    For any members of the Board of Directors who elected to have amounts deferred under the Headwaters Director Deferred
Compensation Plan deemed invested in Headwaters common stock, (i) each share of Headwaters common stock purchased by Headwaters and held as treasury stock immediately
prior to the effective time of the merger in connection with such deferrals will be canceled in accordance with the merger agreement, and (ii) the director will be entitled to
receive a cash payment in respect of each such share, without interest, in an amount equal to the merger consideration, subject to and payable in accordance with the terms of the
Headwaters Director Deferred Compensation Plan.

Payment Procedures

        Prior to the effective time of the merger, Boral will appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Headwaters to act as paying agent, which we refer to as the
paying agent, for the payment and delivery of the merger consideration. At or prior to the effective time of the merger, Boral will deposit with the paying agent, for the benefit of
the holders of Headwaters common stock, for payment in accordance with the merger agreement through the paying agent, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate merger
consideration.

        As promptly as reasonably practicable after the effective time of the merger (and in any event within four business days after the effective time of the merger), Boral will
cause the paying agent to mail, or otherwise provide in the case of book-entry shares, to each holder of record of Headwaters common stock (other than excluded shares):

• transmittal materials, including a form of letter of transmittal; and 

• instructions for effecting the surrender of book-entry shares or certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the certificates) to the paying agent in exchange for
payment of the merger consideration.

        Upon (i) in the case of shares of Headwaters common stock represented by a certificate, the surrender of such certificate for cancellation to the paying agent (or an affidavit
of loss in lieu of such certificate) together with the letter of transmittal duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or (ii) in the case of
shares of Headwaters common stock held in book-entry form, the receipt of an "agent's message" by the paying agent (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the paying
agent may reasonably request), in each case together with such other

documents as may reasonably be required by the paying agent, the holder of such shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the merger consideration into which such
shares have been converted. If a transfer of ownership of Headwaters common stock occurs that is not registered in the transfer records of Headwaters, the merger consideration
may be paid to a transferee if the certificate representing the Headwaters common stock (or, if such Headwaters common stock is held in book-entry form, proper evidence of
such transfer) is presented to the paying agent with all required evidence.

        Any portion of the payment fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the holders of Headwaters common stock for twelve
months after the effective time of the merger will be delivered to Boral, and any holder of Headwaters common stock who has not theretofore complied with the exchange
procedures will thereafter look only to Boral for payment of its claim for merger consideration, without any interest thereon. None of Headwaters, Boral, Merger Sub or the
paying agent will be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the payment fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. Any portion of the payment fund which remains undistributed to the holders of certificates (or shares of Headwaters common stock held in book-entry form) for two
years after the effective time of the merger (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which the payment fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any
governmental entity), will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Boral, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

        If any certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, and the person making such a claim makes an affidavit and if required by Boral, such person posts a bond in an amount directed
by Boral as an indemnity against any claim that may be made against it regarding the certificate, the paying agent will, in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
pay the merger consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to the merger agreement.

Withholding Rights

        Each of Boral, Merger Sub, Headwaters, the surviving company and the paying agent (without duplication) will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration or
any other payments otherwise payable to any holder of Headwaters common stock pursuant to the merger agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under applicable tax law or any other applicable law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate governmental entity will
be treated for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been paid to the holder of Headwaters common stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

Appraisal Rights

        No shares of Headwaters common stock that are issued and outstanding as of the effective time of the merger and that are held by a stockholder who has properly exercised
such stockholder's appraisal rights in respect of such shares under Section 262 of the DGCL, which we refer to as dissenting shares, will be converted into or represent the right
to receive the merger consideration and instead will be entitled to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL (unless and until such stockholder shall have failed to
timely perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such stockholder's right to dissent from the merger under the DGCL, in which case such stockholder will be entitled to
receive the merger consideration, without interest thereon, in exchange for such shares of Headwaters common stock, and such shares will no longer be deemed to be dissenting
shares) and to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such dissenting shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the DGCL. Please
see "Proposal No.1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 65 of this proxy statement.

Additional Agreements

        Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the merger agreement, Headwaters agreed that it will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, and that it will direct and use
reasonable best efforts to cause, its and their respective directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors, agents and other representatives
of Headwaters or its subsidiaries to, (i) immediately cease any existing solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any person with respect to any inquiry, discussion, offer or
request that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an alternative proposal (as described below), which we refer to herein as an inquiry, (ii) promptly request the

agreement, made or indicated an intention to make, or engaged in diligence or substantive discussions with respect to, an alternative proposal, (iii) immediately cease access to
any person (other than Boral and its affiliates and its and their representatives and Headwaters and its representatives) to any electronic data room maintained by Headwaters with
respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or any alternative proposal and (iv) not, and not publicly announce any intention to, directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, facilitate or induce any inquiry or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to,
any alternative proposal; 

• furnish information to or afford access to the business, employees, officers, contracts, properties, assets, books or records of Headwaters and its subsidiaries to any

inquiry;

• grant any waiver, amendment or release under any state antitakeover statute; 

• grant any waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality or standstill agreement or provisions of similar effect to which it is a party or of which it is a
beneficiary (and Headwaters will enforce any such provisions, except that Headwaters will not be required to enforce, and will be permitted to waive, any
provision that prohibits or purports to prohibit a proposal being made to the Board of Directors on a confidential basis to the extent that the Board of Directors
determines, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with Headwaters' outside legal counsel), that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable law); 

• effect any adverse recommendation change (as described below); or 

• enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or any agreement providing for any alternative proposal (except for permitted confidentiality agreements,
as described below).

        Any violation of the restrictions described above by any representative of Headwaters or any of its subsidiaries will constitute a breach of such restriction(s) by Headwaters.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Headwaters or any of its subsidiaries or any of its or their respective representatives receives a written alternative proposal that was
unsolicited after the date of the merger agreement by any person or "group" at any time prior to obtaining the stockholder approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement
that did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of the non-solicit provisions of the merger agreement, Headwaters and its representatives may, prior to (but not after)
obtaining stockholder approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, take the actions set forth in the two bullets below if the Board of Directors has determined in its
good faith judgment (after consultation with Headwaters' financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that such alternative proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected
to lead to a superior proposal (as described below) and the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable
law:

• obtain from such person or "group" an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive in all material respects with respect to such
person or "group" as the terms of the confidentiality agreement (which confidentiality agreement will include a standstill agreement but may permit submission of
non-public, private proposals to the Board of Directors); and 

• following the entry into such confidentiality agreement, furnish information to such person or "group," enter into discussions and negotiations with such person or
"group" with respect to such alternative proposal and afford access to the business, employees, officers, contracts, properties, assets, books and records of
Headwaters and its subsidiaries in response to such alternative proposal.

        Headwaters has also agreed that promptly (but in no event more than 24 hours) following receipt of any alternative proposal or any inquiry, Headwaters will advise Boral in
writing (including by e-mail) of the receipt of such alternative proposal or inquiry, and the terms and conditions of such alternative proposal or inquiry (including, in each case,
the identity of the person or "group" making any such alternative proposal or inquiry), and Headwaters will as promptly as practicable provide to Boral (i) a copy of such
alternative proposal or inquiry, if in writing, or (ii) a written summary of the material terms of such alternative proposal or inquiry, if oral. Headwaters has also agreed that it will
provide to Boral (on a substantially simultaneous basis) any non-public information concerning Headwaters or any of its subsidiaries that may be provided (in accordance with
the preceding paragraph) to any other person or "group" in connection with any alternative proposal or inquiry that has not previously been provided to Boral. In addition,
Headwaters has agreed to provide Boral as promptly as practicable with notice setting forth all such information as is reasonably necessary to keep Boral informed on a current
basis in all material respects of all material communications regarding such alternative proposal or

inquiry (including material amendments or proposed material amendments thereto (including all pricing changes)).

        For purposes of the merger agreement:

• an "alternative proposal" means any bona fide proposal or offer (whether or not in writing), with respect to any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange, other
business combination or similar transaction involving Headwaters which would result in any person or "group" beneficially owning 20% or more of the
outstanding equity interests of Headwaters or any successor or parent company thereto; (ii) sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly
(including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests
in a Headwaters subsidiary or otherwise), of any business or assets of Headwaters or the Headwaters subsidiaries representing 20% or more of the consolidated
revenues, net income or assets of Headwaters and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (iii) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any person (or
the stockholders of any person) or "group" of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such
securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of Headwaters; (iv) transaction in which any person (or the stockholders of any person) shall acquire,
directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially owns or has the right to
acquire beneficial ownership of, 20% or more of the Headwaters common stock or securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing 20% or more of the voting power of Headwaters; or (v) any combination of the foregoing (in each case,
other than the merger); and 

• a "superior proposal" means any bona fide written proposal or offer made by a third party or "group" pursuant to which such third party (or, in a parent-to-parent
merger involving such third party, the stockholders of such third party) or "group" would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the Headwaters
common stock or assets of Headwaters and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (A) on terms which the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of
Headwaters common stock than the merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and the merger agreement (including any changes
proposed by Boral to the terms of the merger agreement); and (B) that the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects (including certainty of closing) of such proposal.

Change of Recommendation

        As described under "Proposal No. 1—Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Recommendation of Our Board of Directors" beginning on page 48 of this proxy statement, and
subject to the provisions described below, the Board of Directors has made the recommendation that the holders of Headwaters shares vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.

        At any time prior to obtaining the stockholder approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, the Board of Directors may (i) solely upon the occurrence of an
intervening event (as described below) or in the event that Headwaters has received a superior proposal (after taking into account the terms of any revised offer by Boral, as
described below), withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Boral, the Board of Directors'

recommendation in favor of voting for the adoption of the merger agreement, or take any action, or make any public statement, filing or release inconsistent with such
recommendation (including, for the avoidance of doubt, recommending against the merger or approving, endorsing or recommending any alternative proposal) and (ii) if
Headwaters has received a superior proposal (after taking into account the terms of any revised offer by Boral, as described below), terminate the merger agreement to enter into
a definitive written agreement providing for such superior proposal simultaneously with the termination of the merger agreement, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), if the Board of
Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their
fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the merger agreement provides that the Board of Directors may not make an adverse recommendation change in response to a superior
proposal, or terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal, unless:

• Headwaters has complied in all material respects with the restrictions described in "—No Solicitation" and in "—Change of Recommendation"; 

• Headwaters has provided prior written notice to Boral at least three business days in advance of taking such action, which notice will advise Boral that the Board
of Directors has received a superior proposal and will include a copy of such superior proposal and all other material transaction agreements and other material
documents relating to such superior proposal (or, where no such copy is available, a description of the material terms and conditions of such superior proposal); 

• during the notice period, Headwaters has and has caused its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to negotiate with Boral in good faith (to the extent Boral
desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that such superior proposal ceases to constitute (in the
judgment of the Board of Directors after consultation with Headwaters' financial advisors and outside legal counsel) a superior proposal; and 

• the Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or
modifications made or agreed to by Boral, if any, and after consultation with Headwaters' financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such superior proposal
remains a superior proposal.

        If during the notice period any revisions are made to the superior proposal, Headwaters must deliver a new written notice to Boral and must comply with the requirements
described above with respect to such new written notice; however, for purposes of this sentence, references to the three business day notice period above shall be deemed to be
references to a two business day notice period.

        In addition to the foregoing, the Board of Directors may not make an adverse recommendation change in response to an intervening event unless:

• Headwaters has complied in all material respects with the restrictions described in "—No Solicitation" and in "—Change of Recommendation"; 

• Headwaters has provided prior written notice to Boral at least three business days, referred to herein as the notice period, in advance of taking such action, which
notice will advise Boral of the circumstances giving rise to the adverse recommendation change; 

• during the notice period, Headwaters has and has caused its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to negotiate with Boral in good faith (to the extent Boral
desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that the failure to make such adverse recommendation
change (in the judgment of the Board of Directors after

consultation with Headwaters' financial advisors and outside legal counsel) would no longer be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties
under applicable law; and

• the Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or
modifications made or agreed to by Boral, if any, and after consultation with Headwaters' financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make
such adverse recommendation change would be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        Nothing in the merger agreement will prevent Headwaters or the Board of Directors from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an alternative proposal or from making any disclosure to Headwaters'
stockholders if the Board of Directors (after consultation with outside legal counsel) concludes that its failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law; provided that any adverse recommendation change may only be made in accordance with the preceding paragraphs. Any public disclosure (other than any "stop,
look and listen" statement) by Headwaters, any of its subsidiaries or the Board of Directors relating to any determination or other action by the Board of Directors or Headwaters
with respect to any alternative proposal will be deemed to be an adverse recommendation change unless the Board of Directors expressly publicly reaffirms its recommendation
in favor of voting for the adoption of the merger agreement in such disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a factually accurate public statement that describes Headwaters'
receipt of an alternative proposal and the operation of the merger agreement with respect thereto (in which Headwaters indicates that it has not changed its recommendation) will
not, in and of itself, be deemed an adverse recommendation change; it being understood that any disclosure contemplated by the foregoing relating to an alternative proposal will
be deemed to be an adverse recommendation change unless the Board of Directors indicates that it has not changed its recommendation in such disclosure.

        In addition, if (i) any public announcement regarding an alternative proposal is made by any of Headwaters' representatives or by the person making such alternative
proposal, (ii) within three business days following such public announcement, Boral delivers to Headwaters in writing a request that the Board of Directors expressly publicly
reaffirm its recommendation in favor of voting for the adoption of the merger agreement (which such request may be made by Boral only once with respect to such alternative
proposal, unless any revisions are made to such alternative proposal in which case an additional request may be made by Boral once with respect to each such revised alternative
proposal), and (iii) the Board of Directors does not expressly publicly reaffirm its recommendation in favor of voting for the adoption of the merger agreement during the period
of three business days following the delivery to Headwaters of such request, then Headwaters will be deemed to have made an adverse recommendation change at 11:59 p.m.,
New York City time, on the last day of such period of three business days.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, an "intervening event" means a material event, development, occurrence, effect, condition or change affecting Headwaters that was
not known or reasonably foreseeable (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the probability or magnitude of consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable)
to the Board of Directors as of the date of the merger agreement, which material event, development, occurrence, effect, condition or change (including any change in probability
or magnitude of consequences) becomes known to the Board of Directors prior to the Headwaters' stockholder approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; however,
in no event will the following events, developments, occurrences, effects, conditions or changes constitute or give rise to an intervening event: (A) any action taken by the parties
to the merger agreement to the extent required by the affirmative covenants set forth in the merger agreement relating to obtaining regulatory approvals, and the consequences of
any such action; (B) the receipt, existence of or terms of an alternative proposal or inquiry or the consequences thereof;

or (C) compliance with, any required notices or filings under and the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, including any consequence of
noncompliance thereof or the non-expiration of such waiting period or any action in connection therewith.

Headwaters Stockholders Meeting

        Headwaters has agreed to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of (i) seeking the Headwaters stockholder approval of the
adoption of the merger agreement and (ii) in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, seeking advisory approval of a
proposal to the Headwaters stockholders for a non-binding, advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may become payable to Headwaters' "named executive officers"
as determined under Regulation S-K in connection with the completion of the merger. Headwaters will convene and hold the stockholders meeting as soon as possible after the
twentieth business day following the mailing of this proxy statement to Headwaters' stockholders. Nonetheless, if on a date for which the Headwaters stockholders meeting is
scheduled, Headwaters has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of its common stock to obtain the Headwaters stockholder approval, whether or not a
quorum is present, Headwaters will, upon the request of Boral (and only with the prior written consent of Boral), make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of
the Headwaters stockholders meeting; provided that the Headwaters stockholders meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than twenty days after the date for
which the Headwaters stockholders meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable law). Once Headwaters has
established a record date for its stockholders meeting, Headwaters may not change such record date or establish a different record date for the Headwaters stockholders meeting
without the prior written consent of Boral (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by applicable law.

Further Action; Efforts 

        Headwaters and Boral have each agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other party in doing, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under the merger agreement and applicable law to consummate and make effective the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as soon as practicable.

        To the extent necessary in order to obtain the requisite authorizations of governmental entities and subject to the limitations described below, Boral has agreed to propose,
negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, assignment or
disposition of such assets or businesses of Boral, or as of the effective time of the merger, of Headwaters, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action which it
is lawfully capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action, in each case, as may be required in order to avoid the commencement of any action
by any governmental entity to prohibit the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on the basis of the antitrust laws, or if already commenced, to avoid the entry of, or
to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order issued or imposed on the basis of the antitrust laws so as to enable the closing to occur as
soon as reasonably possible, and in any event, not later than the end date (as described below).

Table of Contents

        Notwithstanding Boral's obligations summarized in the immediately foregoing paragraph, nothing contained in the merger agreement, including the "reasonable best efforts"
standard generally, will require, or be construed to require that Boral take, or cause to be taken:

• (i) any action with respect to any of the assets or businesses of Boral, Headwaters or their respective subsidiaries that is not conditioned on consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; or 

• (ii) any action that would require Boral to sell, divest, assign, dispose of or hold separate (or effect any other remedy requested by a governmental entity in respect
of) any assets or businesses of Boral, Headwaters or their respective subsidiaries, or agree to, or enter into any conditions or mitigation agreements or other
remedies under the antitrust laws, the DPA, which means section 721 of Title VII of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended and including the
amendments under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007, and the CFIUS regulations
promulgated thereunder, or the ICA, which would, in the aggregate, represent or cause a one year loss of EBIT (as measured by 2016 EBIT contribution) in
excess of $15,000,000 or, subject to certain exceptions, require divestiture or licensing of either party's brand or related intellectual property. For purposes of the
merger agreement, EBIT means with respect to any person, the sum of (a) consolidated net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, plus (b) without
duplication and to the extent deducted in determining such consolidated net income, the sum of (i) consolidated interest expense and (ii) consolidated income tax
expense, in each case of such person and its subsidiaries.

        In addition, Boral and Headwaters each agreed to:

• file as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten business days of the execution of the merger agreement, unless a later time is mutually agreed by the
parties) with the FTC and the Antitrust Division the notification and report form required under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement;

third party, in each case that are reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in connection with the foregoing.

        Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs, Boral and Headwaters will have no obligation to pay any fee to any third party for the purpose of obtaining any such
authorization, or pay any costs and expenses of any third party resulting from the process of obtaining such authorization (without limiting Boral's obligations discussed at the
beginning of this "—Further Action; Efforts" section), except to the extent that either party is required by law to pay any filing fees due to any governmental entities reviewing
the transaction.

        Headwaters will not enter into any agreement with the FTC or the Antitrust Division not to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, except with
the prior written consent of Boral.

        In connection with the reasonable best efforts referenced above, the parties are obligated to, as applicable:

• cooperate in all respects with each other and their respective representatives in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any proceeding by
or before a governmental entity, including any proceeding initiated by a private party; 

• promptly inform the other party, or its counsel, upon receipt of any substantive communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, CFIUS, the
IRD, the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other governmental entity or such private party, in each case, regarding any such filing, submission, proceeding or the
transactions contemplated hereby; 

• permit the other party or its counsel to review and discuss reasonably in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party or its counsel in
connection with, any proposed substantive communication to be given by it to CFIUS, the IRD, the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any such other governmental
entity or, in connection with any proceeding by such private party, any other person; and 

• to the extent not prohibited by CFIUS, the IRD, the FTC, the Antitrust Division or such other governmental entity, give the other party or its counsel reasonable
advance notice of any in-person meeting, and any conference call that is initiated by such party or scheduled in advance, with such governmental entity or such
private party and not participate independently therein without first giving the other party or its counsel reasonable opportunity to attend and participate therein or,
in the event such other party or its counsel does not attend or participate therein, consulting with such other party or its counsel reasonably in advance and
considering in good faith the views of such other party or its counsel in connection therewith.

        With respect to the matters covered in this "—Further Action; Efforts" section, Headwaters and Boral agreed that Boral will have the principal responsibility for devising
and implementing the strategy for obtaining CFIUS clearance, ICA clearance and any necessary antitrust or competition clearances; however, Boral will consult in advance with
Headwaters and in good faith take Headwaters' views into account regarding the overall strategic direction of obtaining CFIUS clearance, ICA clearance or antitrust or
competition clearance and consult with Headwaters prior to taking any material substantive position in any written position, or, to the extent practicable, discussions with any
governmental entity. Headwaters will not, and will not permit any of its subsidiaries or representatives to, make any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise engage in
negotiations or discussions with any governmental entity with respect to any substantive proposed settlement, consent decree, commitment or remedy, except as specifically
requested by or agreed with Boral. Nothing in the merger agreement will require Boral (or permit Headwaters or its subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Boral) to
litigate with any governmental entity.

        Each of Boral and Headwaters will comply, as early and completely as practicable and advisable, with any request for additional information, documents or other materials
received by such party or any of its subsidiaries from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other governmental entity in relation to the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

        During the term of the merger agreement, neither Headwaters nor any of its affiliates nor any of their respective representatives will cooperate with any other person in
seeking regulatory clearance of any alternative proposal.

Employees and Employee Benefits 

        From and after the effective time of the merger, Boral will cause the surviving company to honor, in accordance with their terms, all written employment, change in control
and severance agreements or other similar compensation plans between Headwaters or a Headwaters subsidiary and any employee, former employee or director, or any group of
employees or directors, of Headwaters or a Headwaters subsidiary in effect, or as approved by the Board of Directors prior to, or as of the date of the merger agreement.

        Boral will pay or cause to be paid at the completion of the merger all benefits that have accrued and are payable at the closing under the Headwaters benefit plans and
written employment, change in control and severance agreements or other similar compensation plans between Headwaters or a Headwaters subsidiary and any employee, former
employee or director, or any group of employees or directors, of Headwaters or a Headwaters subsidiary.

        From and after the effective time of the merger, Boral will and will cause its subsidiaries (including the surviving company and its subsidiaries) to provide to each employee
of Headwaters and its subsidiaries who is employed immediately following the effective time and who remains in the employ of Boral, Headwaters or any of its subsidiaries after
the closing, which we refer to as a continuing employee:

• for a period of six months following the closing date, a base salary or wage rate and annual target bonus opportunity that are no less favorable than the base salary
or wage rate and annual target bonus opportunity to which such continuing employee was entitled immediately prior to the closing; 

• for a period from closing until the earlier of six months following the closing date or September 30, 2017, short-term sales or incentive bonuses that are no less
favorable than the short-term sales or incentive bonuses to which such continuing employee was entitled immediately prior to the closing; and 

• for a period of six months following the closing date, employee benefits (excluding short-term and long-term cash or equity incentives) that are either
substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those provided to such continuing employees immediately prior to the effective time; or with respect to continuing
employees who become eligible to participate in existing benefit plans of Boral and its subsidiaries during that six-month period, such benefits as are provided to
similarly situated employees of Boral and its subsidiaries who participate in such plans.

        From and after the effective time of the merger, Boral will cause each continuing employee's service with Headwaters and its subsidiaries attributable to any period before
the effective time of the merger to be recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual or benefit levels other than with
respect to vacation, paid time off and severance) under each employee benefit plan or program of Boral or any of its subsidiaries, in which any such continuing employee
becomes eligible to participate; provided, however, that Boral will not be required to make any continuing employees eligible for any specific Boral benefit plan.

        As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of the merger agreement, Headwaters will take all action necessary (i) to ensure that no new offering periods under the
Headwaters Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer to as the Headwaters ESPP, will commence during the period from the date of the merger agreement through the
effective time of the merger, (ii) with respect to any offering period in effect as of the date of the merger agreement that is scheduled to end later than ten days before the effective
time of the merger, to cause such offering period to end no later than ten days before the effective time of the merger, and (iii) for the Headwaters ESPP to terminate in its entirety
effective as of the effective time of the merger.

        The merger agreement provides that none of the foregoing shall be construed to prevent Boral, the surviving company or any subsidiary thereof from terminating the
employment of any continuing employee at any time, or amending or terminating any benefit plan.

Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance 

        Boral has agreed that, from and after the effective time, it will cause Headwaters and its subsidiaries to provide all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time existing at the time of the merger agreement, in favor of the current or former directors,
officers or employees of Headwaters and its subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) and any
indemnification or other similar agreements between any Headwaters indemnified party (as defined below) and Headwaters or any of its subsidiaries (to the extent made
available to Boral prior to the date of the merger agreement), in each case, as in effect on the date of the merger agreement, in accordance with their terms (and subject to certain
procedures set forth in the merger agreement). "Headwaters indemnified party" is defined in the merger agreement as each individual who was prior to or is as of the date of the
merger agreement, or who becomes prior to the effective time of the merger, a director, officer or employee of Headwaters or any of its subsidiaries or who was as of the date of
the merger agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the effective time of the merger, serving at the request of Headwaters or any of its Headwaters subsidiaries as a
director, officer or employee of another person.

        From and after the effective time, Boral agrees to cause the surviving company to indemnify and hold harmless the Headwaters indemnified parties against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable and documented fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred in connection with
any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective
time) and to advance expenses to such Headwaters indemnified parties, in each case subject to certain exceptions and limitations (and subject to certain procedures set forth in the
merger agreement).

        For a period of six years from and after the effective time of the merger, the surviving company will either (and Boral will cause the surviving company to) cause to be
maintained in effect the policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Headwaters or a Headwaters subsidiary as of the date of the merger agreement or
provide substitute policies for Headwaters and its current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and officers insurance coverage currently
maintained by Headwaters, in either case, with amounts not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and
officers liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Headwaters with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the effective time of the
merger, except that in no event shall the surviving company be required to pay (or Boral be required to cause the surviving company to pay) with respect to such insurance
policies in respect of any one policy year more than 300% of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by Headwaters prior to the date of the merger agreement for
directors and officers liability insurance, which we refer to as the maximum amount, and

Table of Contents

if the surviving company is unable to obtain the insurance required, it will obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six-year period for an
annual premium equal to the maximum amount, in respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the closing date, Boral may purchase or
cause Headwaters to purchase, at Boral's option and expense, "tail" directors and officers liability insurance for a period of six years from and after the effective time for
Headwaters and its current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and officers insurance currently maintained by Headwaters. The tail
insurance will provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and will have terms that are not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and
officers liability insurance currently maintained by Headwaters with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the effective time; provided that in
no event will the total cost of any such tail insurance for the directors and officers liability insurance exceed the maximum amount. The surviving company will maintain such
policies in full force and effect during the period of insurance, and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

Transaction Litigation 

        In the event that any litigation relating to the merger agreement, the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement is brought or threatened against
Headwaters, any Headwaters subsidiary, or its or their representatives, by security holders of Headwaters, which we refer to as transaction litigation, Headwaters will promptly
notify Boral of such litigation and will keep Boral informed on a current basis with respect to the status of the transaction litigation. Headwaters will give Boral the opportunity to
participate in and control the defense or settlement of any transaction litigation, and no such settlement will be agreed to without the prior written consent of Boral (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Headwaters will cooperate, will cause the Headwaters subsidiaries to cooperate, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its directors, officers and other representatives to cooperate in the defense against such transaction litigation.

Section 16 Matters 

        Prior to the effective time of the merger, Headwaters will take all steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Headwaters common stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Headwaters common stock) resulting from the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Headwaters immediately prior to the effective time of the merger to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Financing 

        The merger agreement contains certain covenants and agreements relating to Boral's financing, including:

• Boral and Merger Sub will each use reasonable best efforts to obtain the financing or any other alternative debt or equity financing. If prior to the closing the
financing becomes unavailable for any reason on the terms and conditions set forth in the syndicated facility agreement, the fee letter relating thereto or the
underwriting agreement, other than as a result of the consummation of an alternate financing or a reduction in the debt commitments that results in Boral still
having sufficient funds to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, Boral shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following such financing becoming unavailable, replacement debt or equity financing (in an amount sufficient to enable the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement to be consummated) from the same or other sources and on terms and conditions that are not less favorable in the
aggregate to Boral than such unavailable financing or on other terms and conditions acceptable to Boral;

use reasonable best efforts to provide, on a timely basis, all cooperation that is reasonably requested by Boral or that is customary in connection with the
arrangement or consummation of, or the compliance by Boral of its obligations under, Boral's financing or any alternate financing, subject to certain specified
limitations under the merger agreement; 

• Boral will promptly, upon request by Headwaters, reimburse Headwaters for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable and
documented attorneys' fees) incurred by Headwaters or any of the Headwaters subsidiaries in connection with any such party complying with its cooperation
obligations in connection with Boral's financing, and Boral will indemnify and hold harmless Headwaters, the Headwaters subsidiaries and their respective
directors and other representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with
the financing or alternate financing and any information used in connection therewith (other than any information provided by Headwaters or any of the
Headwaters subsidiaries), and any financing-related action taken by any of them at the written request of Boral or Merger Sub; and 

• With respect to certain indebtedness of Headwaters, Headwaters will use reasonable best efforts to deliver all notices and take other actions required to facilitate
the termination of commitments in respect of such indebtedness, repayment in full of all outstanding obligations in respect of such indebtedness and release of any
liens and guarantees in connection therewith on the closing date, and no later than one business day prior to the closing date, Headwaters will use reasonable best
efforts to provide a copy to Boral of customary payoff letters with respect to such indebtedness in substantially final form and in form and substance customarily
provided by the agents of such indebtedness with respect to the payoff thereof.

Conditions to the Completion of the Merger 

        The respective obligations of Headwaters, Boral and Merger Sub to effect the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the closing date of the following
conditions:

• receipt of Headwaters stockholder approval of the adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger; 

• the waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the merger under the HSR Act or similar antitrust law in any jurisdiction outside
of the U.S. where the transaction must be notified to, and cleared or approved by, government regulators before it is legally permitted to be closed shall have been
terminated or shall have expired, the parties shall have received the CFIUS clearance and the ICA clearance shall have been received; and 

• no applicable law and no judgment or other legal restraint or prohibition and no binding order or determination by any governmental entity shall be in effect, and

restraint, in each case that prevents, makes illegal or prohibits the consummation of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        For purposes of the second bullet above, ICA clearance means that, with respect to Part IV.1 of the ICA, (i) either no notice has been sent or order made with respect to the
merger or (ii) if such notice has been sent or order made, receipt of (a) notice that no review will be made with respect to the merger, (b) notice that no further action will be taken
with respect to the merger or (c) an order authorizing the merger.

financing cooperation covenants, or (ii) the obligation to pay a termination fee or expense reimbursement under certain circumstances; and 

• no termination will relieve any party from liability or damages resulting from fraud or willful breach prior to such termination; willful breach being defined in the
merger agreement as a breach of, or failure to perform any of the representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement
that is a consequence of an act or omission undertaken by the breaching or non-performing party with the knowledge (or in cases where such party should
reasonably have had knowledge) that the taking of, or failure to take, such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a material breach of,
or material failure of performance under, the merger agreement.

Termination Fees

        Under the merger agreement, Headwaters will be required to pay a company termination fee of $65 million (less, in certain instances, amounts previously paid to Boral as
expense reimbursement, as described below) in connection with a termination of the merger agreement if:

(50.1%)).

        Under the merger agreement, Boral will be required to pay Headwaters a termination fee of $75 million if either Boral or Headwaters terminates the merger agreement
pursuant to:

• (i) the legal restraint termination right and the applicable legal restraint giving rise to such termination right is issued under or pursuant to any antitrust law or
results from a failure to obtain CFIUS clearance or (ii) the end date termination right and, in either case of clause (i) or (ii), on the termination date, the only
conditions to closing that have not been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, which conditions would be
capable of being satisfied at the closing if the closing date were on the termination date) are the closing conditions relating to obtaining the necessary regulatory
approvals and the absence of legal restraints (but only if the applicable legal restraint giving rise to such termination right is issued under or pursuant to any
antitrust law or results from a failure to obtain CFIUS clearance); provided, that the Boral termination fee will not be payable to Headwaters if Headwaters' breach
of the merger agreement was the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, the failure of the satisfaction of the regulatory approval and legal restraint conditions.

Expense Reimbursement 

        If the merger agreement is terminated because the Headwaters stockholder approval is not obtained, Headwaters would be required to reimburse Boral for up to
$18.5 million of costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Boral or Merger Sub in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, provided,
however, that the maximum amount of the expense reimbursement would be increased to $37 million if the merger agreement is terminated after the institutional component of
Boral's equity financing, as described above, has been consummated. The payment of the expense reimbursement will not relieve Headwaters of any subsequent obligation to pay
the termination fee; provided that Headwaters will be entitled to a credit against payment of the termination fee (without interest) in respect of any expense reimbursement
previously paid.

Fees and Expenses 

        Except for the provisions described above under "Terms of the Merger Agreement—Expense Reimbursement" beginning on page 96 and as specifically provided in the
merger agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not such transactions are consummated.

Amendment and Waiver 

Amendment

        The parties may modify, amend or supplement the merger agreement at any time before or after receipt of the Headwaters stockholder approval only by written agreement of
each of the parties; provided, however, that after the Headwaters stockholder approval has been obtained, there will be no amendment of the merger agreement that by law
requires further approval by the stockholders of

unless required by law.

Waiver

        At any time prior to the effective time of the merger, the parties to the merger agreement may:

• waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to the merger agreement; 

• waive compliance with any covenants and agreements contained in the merger agreement; and 

• waive the satisfaction of any of the conditions contained in the merger agreement.

Governing Law 

        The merger agreement is governed by the laws of the state of Delaware (without giving effect to choice of law principles thereof).

Specific Performance 

        The parties are entitled to injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms of the merger agreement in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or equity.

PROPOSAL NO. 2—ADVISORY VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 

Interests of Headwaters' Directors and Named Executive Officers in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of the Headwaters Board to approve the merger agreement, you should be aware that Headwaters' directors and named executive officers
have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Headwaters stockholders generally. The Headwaters Board was aware of these interests and
considered them, among other matters, in evaluating the merger agreement, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, and in recommending to the Headwaters
stockholders that the merger agreement be approved. These interests, which are described and quantified in more detail below, include the following:

• The merger agreement provides for the cash settlement of all outstanding Headwaters stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock
units and amounts deferred under the Headwaters Director Deferred Compensation Plan, in each case whether vested or unvested; the treatment of outstanding
equity awards is described in more detail under "Terms of the Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration—Treatment of Equity and Equity-Based Awards"
beginning on page 73; 

• Kirk Benson, our Chief Executive Officer, and other executive officers are party to employment agreements and change of control agreements with Headwaters
that provide for severance benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment in connection with or following the merger. These agreements
are discussed in more detail in the section below titled "—Agreements with Named Executive Officers"; 

• Continued indemnification rights and directors' and officers' liability insurance to be provided by the surviving company described above under "Terms of the
Merger Agreement—Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance" beginning on page 90.

Agreements with Named Executive Officers

        Change in Control Agreements.    The Compensation Committee has approved "Executive Change in Control Agreements" with certain of our officers, including all of the
named executives. Upon a change in control, as defined, the agreements provide for immediate vesting and exercisability of all outstanding stock-based awards not continued by
a successor. In addition, if termination of employment occurs within a specified period of a change in control, the agreements provide for (i) severance pay equal to a stipulated
multiple of the sum of the person's current annual salary plus a bonus component based on either past bonuses paid or the target bonus for the fiscal year in which the change in
control occurs; and (ii) continuance of health and other benefits and perquisites for a stipulated period following the change in control. Further, if any long-term cash awards are
not continued, payment shall be made based on the pro-rated level of performance achieved as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter.

Merger-Related Compensation including Change in Control Agreements

        The table below sets forth for each of the named executive officers estimates of the amounts of compensation that are based on or otherwise relate to the merger and that
may become payable to the executive either immediately after the effective time of the merger or upon a subsequent qualifying termination of employment. Headwaters'
stockholders are being asked to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, such compensation for these executives. Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory
only, it will not be binding on Headwaters. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved at the meeting (or any adjournment thereof) and the merger is completed, the
compensation

may be payable regardless of the outcome of the vote to approve such compensation, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto.

        The estimates in the table assume for illustrative purposes that the merger will become effective prior to September 30, 2017 and that each named executive officer will
incur a qualifying termination of employment immediately thereafter. The estimated amounts in the table are based on multiple assumptions that may not actually occur,
including assumptions described in this proxy statement. Please refer to the footnotes to the table for additional assumptions.

(1) Cash. The amounts reported in this column consist of (i) a cash severance amount payable under each named executive officer's Change in Control
agreement (described in detail below), upon a "double-trigger" qualifying termination of the named executive's employment (except for Mr. Gehrmann
for whom there is a "single-trigger" qualification), equal to two times the sum of (x) the named executive's base salary in effect as of the date of
termination of employment or, if higher, the salary actually paid for either of the two preceding completed fiscal years, and (y) the named executive's
actual annual bonus earned for the fiscal year in which the termination of employment occurs (for all named executives except for Mr. Newman, for
whom the target annual bonus is used) or, for all named executives if higher, the bonus actually paid for either of the two preceding completed fiscal
years, and (ii) a cash payment for the sum of the prior fiscal years' cash-based performance unit awards that have been earned and accrued but remain
unvested and unpaid as of the termination date, plus the current fiscal year's target cash-based performance unit award amount adjusted, in the instance
of the current year only, for the current fiscal year's financial performance through the termination date. Cash-based performance unit awards represent
compensation earned in the normal course of business, but the vesting of the unit awards is accelerated due to the change in control. The table below
quantifies each of the components of the cash severance compensation included in the cash total reported above, using an assumption that the target
cash-based performance unit awards for the current fiscal year are earned as of the assumed termination date.

Certain Definitions used in Change in Control Agreements

        For purposes of Headwaters' change in control agreements, "Involuntary Termination without Cause" means the involuntary termination of an executive's employment by
Headwaters for reasons other than (1) the commission by the executive of a felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, (2) any intentional act of fraud, embezzlement or
misappropriation of property of Headwaters by the executive which has a materially adverse impact on the business or affairs of Headwaters, (3) any intentional unauthorized use
or disclosure by the executive of confidential information or trade secrets of Headwaters (or any affiliated corporation or entity of Headwaters ("Affiliate")), (4) any other
intentional misconduct by the executive which has a materially adverse impact on the business or affairs of Headwaters (or any Affiliate), (5) the death of the executive, (6) the
inability of the executive to perform the executive's duties due to a disability (as defined and determined under the terms of Headwaters' long-term disability plan), or (7) the
failure or refusal by the executive to perform the duties of the executive's position with Headwaters, provided that solely for the purpose of item (7), the executive shall be given
thirty (30) days written notice (and the opportunity to correct such conduct if such conduct can be corrected during that notice period) of the

(2) Equity. The amounts reported in this column reflect the value of accelerating the vesting of the unvested equity awards that would occur at the effective
time of the merger, as provided by the merger agreement (a "single trigger" arrangement). The table below quantifies each of the components of the
equity-based severance compensation included in the equity total reported above, with amounts calculated using an assumed value per share of $24.25.
For purposes of the table below, the value of the accelerated vesting of each stock appreciation right (SAR) is calculated as $24.25 per share minus the
grant price of the SAR and the value of the accelerated vesting of each restricted share is calculated as $24.25 per share.

(3) Retirement Plan. The amounts reported in this column reflect the estimated value of retirement benefits that would be paid at the effective time of the
merger (a "single trigger" arrangement). For Messrs. Newman, Hatfield and Gehrmann, the amounts represent the unvested contributions and earnings
thereon of Headwaters' contributions to the Executive Retirement Program (ERP), all of which become fully vested and payable upon the completion of
the merger. Mr. Benson does not participate in the ERP and Mr. Lents, who does participate, is fully vested and therefore would have no acceleration of
vesting benefit. 

(4) Perquisites/benefits. The amounts reported in this column reflect the estimated value of certain other benefits that would become obligations upon a
"double-trigger" qualifying termination for all named executives, consisting of continuation of auto allowance benefits and the cost of continuation of
health, life and related insurance benefits, all calculated using a factor of two times the current estimated annual cost of providing such benefits in
accordance with the terms and conditions of each named executive officer's Change in Control agreement (described in detail above).

Headwaters' intention to terminate the employment of the executive and to deem the termination of the executive's employment to be for the foregoing reason.

        "Voluntary Termination With Good Reason" means the executive's voluntary resignation within sixty (60) days following the occurrence of any of the following actions
without the executive's consent ("Good Reason"): (1) the material, involuntary reduction in the executive's title, responsibilities, authorities or functions as an employee of
Headwaters as in effect immediately prior to a change in control, as defined (but not merely a change in title or reporting relationships), except in connection with the termination
of the executive's employment for death, disability, retirement, fraud, misappropriation, embezzlement or any other conduct listed under the definition of cause; (2) a reduction in
the executive's level of compensation (including base salary, fringe benefits and target bonuses under any corporate-performance based bonus or incentive programs) by more
than ten percent (10%) unless such reduction is part of a general reduction applicable to all of the executives of Headwaters; (3) a relocation of the executive's regular place of
employment by more than fifty (50) miles; (4) any material breach by Headwaters or its successor or assign of any employment agreement between Headwaters and the
executive; or (5) any failure by Headwaters to obtain the assumption of any material agreement and the material provisions of any stock option grant, between the executive and
Headwaters from any successor or assign of Headwaters following a change in control.

Equity Interests of Headwaters' Named Executive Officers

        The following table sets forth the number of shares of Headwaters common stock and the number of shares of Headwaters common stock underlying SARs held by each of
Headwaters' named executives, in each case that either are currently owned or vested or that are scheduled to vest by the effective time of the merger, assuming that the effective
time of the merger occurs prior to September 30, 2017, which is the next scheduled vesting date. It is assumed that the named executives will not sell or acquire any shares of
Headwaters common stock and will not exercise any SARs before September 30, 2017. The table also sets forth the values of these owned shares and vested SARs based on the
$24.25 per share consideration (minus the applicable grant price for SARs).

for options).

SUMMARY OF VESTED EQUITY INTERESTS OF NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS 

        Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, Headwaters is required to submit a proposal to its stockholders for an advisory
(non-binding) vote to approve certain compensation that may become payable to Headwaters' named executive officers in connection with the completion of the merger. This
proposal gives Headwaters' stockholders the opportunity to vote, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, on the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Headwaters'
named executive officers in connection with the merger. This compensation is summarized above in this section, including the footnotes to the tables and the associated narrative
discussion. Headwaters' board of directors unanimously recommends that stockholders approve the following resolution:

"RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of Headwaters in connection with the merger, as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the table in the section of the proxy statement titled "Proposal No. 2—Advisory Vote on Merger-Related
Named Executive Officer Compensation—Interests of Headwaters' Directors and Named Executive Officers in the Merger—Merger-Related Compensation
including Change in Control Agreements" including the footnotes to the table and the associated narrative discussion, and the agreements and plans pursuant to
which such compensation may be paid or become payable, are hereby APPROVED."

        The vote on the merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger
agreement and vote not to approve the merger-related compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the merger-related compensation proposal is advisory only, it
will not be binding on either Headwaters or Boral. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is approved and adopted and the merger is completed, the compensation may become
payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the vote on the merger-related compensation proposal.

        The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the approval of the merger-related executive compensation of our named executive officers, as
disclosed in this proxy statement.

PROPOSAL NO. 3—APPROVAL OF ADJOURNMENT OF SPECIAL MEETING 

        Stockholders are being asked to grant authority to proxy holders to vote in favor of one or more adjournments of the meeting of stockholders to a later date or dates (or a
recess or postponement thereof), if necessary or appropriate in the view of the Board of Directors, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the
meeting to approve the merger agreement, which we refer to as the adjournment proposal. If the adjournment proposal is approved, the meeting could be successively adjourned
to any date and we could use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly
executed proxies voting against adoption of the merger agreement. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies
representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the merger agreement such that the proposal to adopt the merger agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the
special meeting without a vote on the adoption of the merger agreement and seek to solicit the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the
merger agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the special meeting if a quorum is not present at the special meeting. Headwaters does not intend to call a vote on
adjournment of the meeting to solicit additional proxies if the merger agreement is approved at the meeting.

        The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote FOR the adjournment of the meeting of stockholders, if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the meeting.

MARKET PRICE OF HEADWATERS COMMON STOCK AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION 

        Our common stock trades on the NYSE under the symbol "HW." As of December 23, 2016, there were 74,883,657 shares of our common stock outstanding, held by
approximately 276 stockholders of record.

        The following table sets forth the high and low reported sale prices for our common stock for the periods shown as reported on the NYSE. No dividends were declared on
the Headwaters common stock in the periods shown.

        On November 18, 2016, the last trading day before we publicly announced the execution of the merger agreement, the high and low sale prices for our common stock as
reported on the NYSE were $20.37 and $20.03 per share, respectively, and the closing sale price on that date was $20.09, compared to which the consideration of $24.25 in cash
per share represents a premium of approximately 21%. On December 23, 2016, the record date for the special meeting, the high and low sale prices for our common stock as
reported on the NYSE were $23.58 and $23.52 per share, respectively, and the closing sale price on that date was $23.53. As of the record date, there were 74,883,657 shares of
Headwaters common stock issued and outstanding and approximately 276 holders of record.

        No cash dividends were paid on our common stock during fiscal years 2016, 2015 or 2014. Our ability to pay future cash dividends will depend upon, among other things,
our earnings, anticipated expansions, capital requirements, compliance with limitations under our senior secured loan and revolving credit facilities, and our financial condition.
Furthermore, under the terms of the merger agreement, we are generally prohibited from declaring, authorizing, making or paying any dividend or distribution. We do not expect
to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD OBTAIN A CURRENT MARKET QUOTATION FOR OUR COMMON STOCK BEFORE MAKING ANY DECISION WITH
RESPECT TO THE MERGER.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 

        The following table sets forth certain information as of December 23, 2016, regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock, for:

• each person (or group of affiliated persons) who, insofar as we have been able to ascertain, beneficially owned more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our
common stock; 

• each director; 

• each named executive officer; and 

• all directors and executive officers as a group.

        We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on the information
furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock that they beneficially
own.

        We relied on information received from each stockholder as to beneficial ownership, including information contained on Schedules 13D and 13G and Forms 3, 4 and 5. As
of December 23, 2016, there were 74,883,657 shares of common stock outstanding. As of that date, there were outstanding

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        If the merger is completed, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any of our stockholder meetings that occur after completion of
the merger. We intend to have our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders in the ordinary course, with the date and time of such annual meeting to be announced at a later date.
Further, if the merger is not completed, or if Headwaters is otherwise required or elects to do so under applicable law, we will continue to hold annual meetings of stockholders.
Any stockholder nominations or proposals for other business intended to be presented at our next annual meeting must be submitted to Headwaters as set forth below.

        Our Bylaws establish an advance notice procedure with regard to certain matters, including stockholder proposals not included in our proxy statement, to be brought before
an annual meeting of stockholders. In general, notice must be received by our Corporate Secretary not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the scheduled date of the
meeting and must contain specified information concerning the matters to be brought before such meeting and concerning the stockholder making the proposal. In the event that
less than 75 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the scheduled meeting is given or made to stockholders, notice by the stockholder must be received not later than
the earlier of the following two dates: (a) the close of business on the 15th day following the day on which notice of the date of the scheduled annual meeting was mailed or
public disclosure was made, or (b) two days prior to the date of the scheduled meeting. Our Bylaws can be found at www.headwaters.com.

canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b), Company Restricted Shares to be converted to cash in accordance with Section 2.04 and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into
the right to the Merger Consideration;

        WHEREAS, the Company Board, the Parent Board and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub have approved this Agreement, determined that the terms of this Agreement
are in the best interests of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, and their respective stockholders, and declared the advisability of this Agreement;

        WHEREAS, the Company Board and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub have recommended adoption and approval of this Agreement by their respective stockholders;

        WHEREAS, in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the parties, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company has entered into a voting
agreement (the "Voting Agreement"), dated as of the date of this Agreement, with Parent, pursuant to which he has agreed, among other things, to vote all of the shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by him in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Voting Agreement; and

        WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties and covenants herein and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I

The Merger

        SECTION 1.01    The Merger.    On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL"), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of

following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in Article III (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions); provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article III, in no event shall the Closing occur prior to the final day of the Marketing Period
(or such date during the Marketing Period specified by Parent to the Company on no less than two Business Days' written notice); or (b) such

other date and time as agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."

        SECTION 1.03    Effective Time.    Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware the certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), executed and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
DGCL, and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings required under the DGCL or by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
or at such later time as the Company and Parent shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

        SECTION 1.04    Effects.    The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

        SECTION 1.05    Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws.    The certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, except that references to the name of
Merger Sub shall be replaced by references to the name of the Surviving Company. The by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
by-laws of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law, except that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be
replaced by references to the name of the Surviving Company.

        SECTION 1.06    Directors and Officers of Surviving Company.    The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Company until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

ARTICLE II

Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of Certificates

        SECTION 2.01    Effect on Capital Stock.    At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holder of any shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") or any shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock"):

        (a)    Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock.    Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company with the same rights, powers and privileges
as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Company (other than any shares converted pursuant to
Section 2.01(b)(ii)). From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

        (b)    Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Conversion of Subsidiary-Owned Stock.    

          (i)  Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company as treasury stock and each share of Company Common Stock that is owned
directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

         (ii)  Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or of Merger Sub shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Company such that the ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time shall equal the
ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        (c)    Conversion of Company Common Stock.    Subject to Sections 2.02 and 2.03, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled or converted into shares of the Surviving Company in accordance with Section 2.01(b), Company Restricted
Shares to be converted to cash in accordance with Section 2.04 and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive (i) $24.25 in cash, without interest, and
(ii) the Additional Consideration, if any (together, the "Merger Consideration"). All such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (each, a "Certificate") (or evidence of shares in book-entry form)
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02. Notwithstanding the foregoing (but without limiting the
restrictions set forth in Section 6.01(a)), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of Company
Common Stock will be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event. As provided in Section 2.02(h), the right of any holder of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by the
amount of any required withholding under applicable Tax Law.

        SECTION 2.02    Exchange of Certificates; Payment Fund; Deliverables.    

        (a)    Paying Agent.    Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the
"Paying Agent") for the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of Company Common Stock, for payment in accordance with this Article II through the Paying Agent, cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration. All such cash deposited with the Paying Agent is hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund."

        (b)    Transmittal Materials.    As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within four Business Days after the Effective Time),
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail, or otherwise provide in the case of book-entry shares, to each holder of record of Company Common Stock (other than
shares to be canceled or converted into shares of

the Surviving Company in accordance with Section 2.01(b), Company Restricted Shares to be converted to cash in accordance with Section 2.04 and Dissenting Shares):
(i) transmittal materials, including a form of letter of transmittal in such form and with such other provisions as Parent may specify, subject to the Company's reasonable
approval, and which shall be prepared prior to Closing (the "Letter of Transmittal") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass
(A) with respect to shares evidenced by Certificates, only upon delivery to the Paying Agent of a duly, completely and validly executed Letter of Transmittal, such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of Certificates as provided in Section 2.02(i)) and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably request and (B) with
respect to book-entry shares, only upon delivery to the Paying Agent of an "agent's message" regarding the book-entry transfer of book-entry shares (or such other
evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request)), and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of book-entry shares or Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in Section 2.02(i)) to the Paying Agent in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration into which such
shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01.

        (c)    Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange.    Upon (i) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate, the
surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent (or an affidavit of loss in lieu of such Certificate as provided in Section 2.02(i)) together with the Letter
of Transmittal duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or (ii) in the case of shares of Company Common Stock held in book-
entry form, the receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), in each
case together with such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing
such Company Common Stock (or, if such Company Common Stock is held in book-entry form, proper evidence of such transfer) is presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each share of Company Common Stock, and any Certificate with respect thereto, shall be deemed at any time from and after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration that the holders of shares of Company Common Stock are entitled to
receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or shares of
Company Common Stock held in book-entry form).

        (d)    No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.    The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of
any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common
Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates (or shares of Company
Common Stock held in book-entry form) that evidenced ownership of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) are

presented to Parent or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

        (e)    Termination of Payment Fund.    Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the
holders of Company Common Stock for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

        (f)    No Liability.    None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed to the
holders of Certificates (or shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) for two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on
which the Payment Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

        (g)    Investment of Payment Fund.    The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in the Payment Fund if and as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to, and be the property of, Parent. No investment losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the
rights of any stockholder of the Company to receive the Merger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein. To the extent there are losses with respect to such
investments or the Payment Fund diminishes for any other reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate funds required to be paid
pursuant to the terms hereof, Parent shall reasonably promptly replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.

        (h)    Withholding Rights.    Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Company and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration or any other payments otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law or any other applicable Law. Amounts so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Entity shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect
of which such deduction or withholding was made.

        (i)    Lost Certificates.    If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, pay the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

        SECTION 2.03    Dissenters' Rights.    Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, no shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who has properly exercised such stockholder's appraisal rights in respect of such shares (any such shares
being referred to herein as "Dissenting Shares") under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.01 and instead shall be entitled to such rights as are granted by

Section 262 of the DGCL (unless and until such stockholder shall have failed to timely perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such stockholder's right to dissent
from the Merger under the DGCL, in which case such stockholder shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Sections 2.01 and 2.02, without
interest thereon, in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock, and such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be deemed to be Dissenting Shares) and
to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of the DGCL. The Company
(i) shall give Parent prompt written notice of any notice or demand for appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock (or threats thereof) and any withdrawals or
attempted withdrawals of such demands or threats received by the Company, (ii) shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to any such demands and (iii) shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by a final, non-appealable order of a Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands, or waive any failure to timely deliver a
written demand for appraisal.

and at and as of the Closing Date as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date) except as set
forth in the Company SEC Documents filed and publicly available after October 1, 2015 and prior to two Business Days before the date of this Agreement (the "Filed Company

Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.03, 4.04 and 4.24 and the first sentence of Section 4.08, and excluding any documents filed as exhibits thereto or incorporated by reference therein, any

disclaimer, or disclosures in any other statements that are similarly cautionary or predictive in nature; it being understood that any historical factual information contained within
such headings, disclosures or statements shall not be excluded) or in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent at or before the execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter"). The Company Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the
numbered and lettered sections contained in this Article IV, and the disclosure in any section shall not be deemed to qualify any other section in this Article IV except to the

authorizations, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals (collectively, "Permits") necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct
its businesses as presently conducted (the "Company Permits"), except where the failure to have such power or authority or to possess Company Permits, individually or in the
aggregate, is not material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to
do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company, by a Company Subsidiary or by the Company and a Company Subsidiary, free and clear of all pledges, liens,
charges, mortgages, deeds of trust, rights of first offer or first refusal, options, encumbrances, any other restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or
otherwise dispose of such capital stock, voting securities or other equity interests) and any security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, with
covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements, encroachments, title retention agreements or other third party rights or title defect of any kind or nature whatsoever,
"Liens"), except for restrictions imposed by applicable securities Laws and except as set forth in Section 4.02(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Section 4.02(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a true and complete list of the Company Subsidiaries, each such Company Subsidiary's
jurisdiction of organization and the class, number and percentage of its authorized, issued and outstanding shares of capital stock, voting securities or other equity
interests, if any, that are not owned by the Company or a Company Subsidiary.

        (b)   Except for the capital stock and voting securities of, and other equity interests in, the Company Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any
capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, any firm, corporation, partnership, company, limited liability company, trust, joint venture, association or
other entity.

equity interests in, the Company, other than the issuance of Company Common Stock upon the exercise of a Company Stock Option or a Company SAR outstanding at

        (b)   All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are, and, at the time of issuance, all such shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Company Stock
Options and Company SARs will be, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject to, or issued in violation of, any purchase option, call
option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right under any provision of the DGCL, the Company Charter, the Company By-laws or
any contract, lease, sublease, license, indenture, note, bond, agreement, understanding, undertaking, concession, franchise or other instrument (in each case, whether in
writing or oral, to the extent legally binding on the parties thereto) (a "Contract") to which the Company is a party or otherwise bound. All grants of equity awards or
other rights with respect to shares of Company Common Stock to current or former directors, officers, employees, agents or consultants of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary have been made in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plans and award agreements thereunder and any policy of the Company or the

way to the price of any Company Capital Stock or any shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, any Company Subsidiary, the value of the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any part of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any dividends or other distributions declared or paid on any shares of

Disclosure Letter, there are not any outstanding obligations of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any securities, interests, warrants, calls, options or other

into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote ("Company Voting Debt"). Other than the
Voting Agreement, there are no voting agreements with respect to the voting of any capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, the Company. Neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement pursuant to which any Person is entitled to elect, designate or nominate any director of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

        SECTION 4.04    Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability.    

        (a)   The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject, in the case of the Merger, to the receipt of the affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting (the "Company Stockholder Approval"). The Company Board has
adopted resolutions, by unanimous vote of the directors present at a meeting duly called at which a quorum of directors of the Company was present, (i) approving the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, (ii) determining that entering into this Agreement is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,
(iii) declaring this Agreement advisable and (iv) recommending that the Company's stockholders adopt this Agreement and directing that this Agreement be submitted to
the Company's stockholders for adoption at a duly held meeting of such stockholders for such purpose (the "Company Stockholders Meeting"). As of the date of this
Agreement, such resolutions have not been amended or withdrawn. Except for the Company Stockholder Approval, no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Company are necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as applicable, this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (except for the filing of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL). The Company has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity.

        (b)   The Company Board has adopted such resolutions as are necessary to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the restrictions on "business combinations" (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL. No "fair price,"
"moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar antitakeover statute or similar statute or regulation (collectively, "Takeover Laws") applies with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There is no stockholder rights plan, "poison pill," antitakeover plan or similar
device in effect to which the Company is a party or is otherwise bound.

performance by it of its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any

Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub

        Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company that the statements contained in this Article V are true and correct at and as of the date of
this Agreement and at and as of the Closing Date as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date)
except as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the Company at or before the execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement (the "Parent
Disclosure Letter"). The Parent Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this
Article V, and the disclosure in any section shall not be deemed to qualify any other section in this Article V except to the extent (and only to the extent) that it is reasonably
apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other section (provided that nothing disclosed in any section of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, other than disclosures expressly made under the numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this Article V,
shall be deemed to qualify the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.01, 5.02, 5.03 and 5.06). The disclosure of any information in the Parent Disclosure Letter
shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgment that such information is required to be disclosed in connection with the representations and warranties made in this
Agreement, nor shall such information be deemed to establish a standard of materiality. No disclosure in the Parent Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or violation
of any contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

        SECTION 5.01    Organization and Standing.    Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept). Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed to do
business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

        SECTION 5.02    Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability.    Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Board of Directors of Parent
(the "Parent Board") has adopted resolutions, by unanimous vote of the directors present at a meeting duly called at which a quorum of directors of Parent was present, approving
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, such resolutions have not been amended or withdrawn. The Board of Directors of
Merger Sub has unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, (ii) determining that entering into this Agreement is in
the best interests of Merger Sub and its sole stockholder, (iii) declaring this Agreement advisable and (iv) recommending that the sole stockholder of Merger Sub adopt this
Agreement and directing that this Agreement be submitted to the sole stockholder of Merger Sub for adoption. As of the date of this Agreement, such resolutions have not been
amended or withdrawn. The sole stockholder of Merger Sub has adopted this Agreement. Except as would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub are necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as applicable, this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except for the filing of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL). Each of Parent
and Merger Sub has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement constitutes its
legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with

        SECTION 5.04    Information Supplied.    None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Proxy Statement will, as of any date it is filed or amended, at the date it is first mailed to the Company's stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. No representation is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein, other than information supplied in writing by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

        SECTION 5.05    Litigation.    There is no suit, action, investigation, inquiry or other proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any

Company, or take any other action to facilitate any Inquiry, (E) approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend any Alternative Proposal, (F) submit to a vote of its

enforce any such provisions (provided that the Company shall not be required to enforce, and shall be permitted to waive, any provision that prohibits or purports to
prohibit a proposal being made to the Company Board on a confidential basis to the extent that the Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel), that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (provided that the Company shall promptly notify Parent after the Company Board makes such determination)), (I) effect any Adverse Recommendation
Change, or (J) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle or any agreement providing for any Alternative Proposal (except for confidentiality agreements
permitted under Section 6.02(b)). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.02(a) (including any direction
hereunder) by any Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall constitute a breach of this Section 6.02(a) by the Company.

        (b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6.02(a), if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives receives a
written Alternative Proposal that was unsolicited after the date hereof by any Person or "Group" at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Approval that did not
result from or arise in connection with a breach of Section 6.02(a), the Company and its Representatives may, prior to (but not after) obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, take the actions set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) of this Section 6.02(b) if the Company Board (including any duly authorized committee thereof) has
determined, in its good faith judgment (after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that such Alternative Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties
under applicable Law: (i) obtain from such Person or "Group" an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive in all material respects with

include a standstill agreement but may permit submission of non-public, private proposals to the Company Board) and, (ii) following the entry into such confidentiality
agreement, furnish information to such Person or "Group," enter into discussions and negotiations with such Person or "Group" with respect to such Alternative Proposal
and afford access to the business, employees, officers, contracts, properties, assets, books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in response to such
Alternative Proposal.

        (c)   Promptly (but in no event more than twenty-four hours) following receipt of any Alternative Proposal or any Inquiry, the Company shall advise Parent in
writing (including by email in accordance with Section 9.07) of the receipt of such Alternative Proposal or Inquiry, and the terms and conditions of such Alternative
Proposal or Inquiry (including, in each case, the identity of the Person or "Group" making any such Alternative Proposal or Inquiry), and the Company shall as promptly
as practicable provide to Parent (i) a copy of such Alternative Proposal or Inquiry, if in writing, or (ii) a written summary of the material terms of such Alternative
Proposal or Inquiry, if oral. The Company agrees that it shall provide to Parent (on a substantially simultaneous basis) any non-public information concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may be provided (pursuant to Section 6.02(b) ) to any other Person or "Group" in connection with any Alternative Proposal or
Inquiry that has not previously been provided to Parent. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent as promptly as practicable with notice setting forth all such
information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed on a current basis in all material respects of all material communications regarding such Alternative
Proposal or Inquiry (including material amendments or proposed material amendments thereto (including all pricing changes)).

        (d)   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may (i) solely upon the
occurrence of an Intervening Event or in the event that the Company has received a Superior Proposal (after taking into account the terms of any revised offer by Parent
pursuant to this Section 6.02(d)), withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation or take any action, or make any public statement, filing or release inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (any of the foregoing being an
"Adverse Recommendation Change") (including, for the avoidance of doubt, recommending against the Merger or approving, endorsing or recommending any Alternative
Proposal) and (ii) if the Company has received a Superior Proposal (after taking into account the terms of any revised offer by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.02(d)),
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d) to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for such Superior Proposal simultaneously with the
termination of this Agreement, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that the Company Board may not
make an Adverse Recommendation Change or, in the case of a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d), unless:

          (i)  the Company has complied in all material respects with this Section 6.02;

         (ii)  the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three Business Days in advance (the "Notice Period") of taking such action, which
notice shall advise Parent, in the case of a Superior Proposal, that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal and shall include a copy of such Superior
Proposal and all other material transaction agreements and other material documents relating to such Superior Proposal (or, where no such copy is available, a
description of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal), or, in cases involving an Intervening Event, of the circumstances giving rise to the
Adverse Recommendation Change;

        (iii)  during the Notice Period, the Company has and has caused its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such
Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the judgment of the Company Board after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel)
a Superior Proposal, or in cases involving an Intervening Event, the failure to

make such Adverse Recommendation Change (in the judgment of the Company Board after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) would no longer be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

        (iv)  the Company Board has determined in good faith, after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals, amendments or
modifications made or agreed to by Parent, if any, and after consultation with the Company's financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that, in the case of a
Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal or, in cases involving an Intervening Event, that the failure to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the directors' exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

If during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior Proposal, the Company shall deliver a new written notice to Parent and shall comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.02(d) with respect to such new written notice; provided, however, that for purposes of this sentence, references to the three Business Day
period above shall be deemed to be references to a two Business Day period.

        (e)   Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal or from making any
disclosure to the Company's stockholders if the Company Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel) concludes that its failure to do so would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that any Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with Section 6.02(d). For the
avoidance of doubt, any public disclosure (other than any "stop, look and listen" statement) by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or the Company Board relating to
any determination or other action by the Company Board or the Company with respect to any Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation
Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a factually accurate
public statement that describes the Company's receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the operation of the Agreement with respect thereto (in which the Company
indicates that it has not changed the Company Recommendation) shall not, in and of itself, be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change; it being understood that any
disclosure contemplated by the foregoing relating to an Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board
indicates that it has not changed the Company Recommendation in such disclosure.

        (f)    If (i) any public announcement regarding an Alternative Proposal is made by any of the Company's Representatives or by the Person making such Alternative
Proposal, (ii) within three Business Days following such public announcement, Parent delivers to the Company in writing a request that the Company Board expressly
publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation (which such request may be made by Parent only once with respect to such Alternative Proposal, unless any revisions
are made to such Alternative Proposal in which case an additional request may be made by Parent once with respect to each such revised Alternative Proposal), and
(iii) the Company Board does not expressly publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation during the period of three Business Days following the delivery to the
Company of such request, then the Company shall be deemed to have made an Adverse Recommendation Change at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of
such period of three Business Days.

        (g)   For purposes of this Agreement:

          (i)  "Alternative Proposal" means any bona fide proposal or offer (whether or not in writing), with respect to any (A) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
other business

way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests in a

each case, other than the Merger).

probability or magnitude of consequences) becomes known to the Company Board prior to the Company Stockholder Approval; provided that, for the avoidance
of doubt, in no event shall the following events, developments, occurrences, effects, conditions or changes constitute or give rise to an Intervening Event: (A) any
action taken by the parties hereto to the extent required by the affirmative covenants set forth in Section 7.03, and the consequences of any such action; (B) the
receipt, existence of or terms of an Alternative Proposal or Inquiry or the consequences thereof; or (C) compliance with, any required notices or filings under and

Common Stock or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (A) on terms which the Company Board determines in good faith

changes proposed by Parent to the terms of this Agreement); and (B) that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel
and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and
other aspects (including certainty of closing) of such proposal.

        (a)   As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any event on or before the date that is fifteen Business Days after the date
hereof), the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company relating to the Company
Stockholders Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Proxy Statement"). Parent and the Company shall cooperate and consult with each

upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall provide the other with
copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and Parent will cooperate in connection
therewith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the
SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent an opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement or response (including the proposed
preliminary and final versions of the Proxy Statement or response), (ii) shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by Parent and (iii) shall not file or
mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The
Company shall cause all documents that it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other Governmental Entities under this Section 7.01(a) to comply in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of Law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

        (b)   If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other information supplied
by Parent for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Parent shall promptly
notify the Company of such event, and Parent shall cooperate with the Company in the Company's prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement and, as required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the Company's stockholders.
Nothing in this Section 7.01(b) shall limit the obligations of any party under Section 7.01(a).

        (c)   If prior to the Effective Time any event occurs with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any change occurs with respect to other information
supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent of such event, and the Company shall promptly file any necessary amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement with the SEC
and, as required by Law, disseminate the information contained in such amendment or supplement to the Company's stockholders. Nothing in this Section 7.01(c) shall

        (d)   The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC clears the Proxy Statement, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of (i) seeking the Company Stockholder Approval and (ii) in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable

compensation that may become payable to the Company's "named executive officers" as determined under Regulation S-K in connection with the completion of the
Merger. In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall (A) as reasonably promptly as practicable after the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no further
comments on the Proxy Statement cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders (and in no event more than five Business Days after the date on
which the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement); and (B) subject to Section 6.02(d), use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as
soon as possible after the twentieth Business Day following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company's stockholders. The Company shall, through the Company
Board, recommend to its stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder Approval (the "Company Recommendation") and shall include such recommendation in
the Proxy Statement, in each case, except to the extent that the Company Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 6.02(d).
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.01(d), if on a date for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the
Company shall, upon the request of Parent (and only with the prior written consent of Parent), make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the
Company Stockholders Meeting; provided that the Company Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than twenty days after the date for
which the Company Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements required by applicable Law). Once the Company has
established a record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record date for the Company
Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless required to do so by applicable Law.

        (e)   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, and, to the extent
required under the terms of this Agreement, the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.03(b) or the Expense Reimbursement in
accordance with Section 8.03(d), (i) its obligations to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to this Section 7.01 shall not be affected by the making of an
Adverse Recommendation Change by the Company Board and (ii) its obligations pursuant to this Section 7.01 shall not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Alternative Proposal. Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms and, to the
extent required under the terms of this Agreement, the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.03(b) or the Expense Reimbursement in
accordance with Section 8.03(d), the Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of the Company's stockholders any Alternative Proposal (whether or not a
Superior Proposal).

        SECTION 7.02    Access to Information; Confidentiality.    Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and to
the Representatives of Parent reasonable access, upon reasonable advance notice, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all their respective properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent (a) to the extent not
publicly available, a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities Laws or commission actions and (b) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request, including all information
regarding the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that is required by the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
listing rules of the ASX and all regulatory guides of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission applicable to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby (including the Offer) (in each case, in a manner so as to not interfere in any material respect with the normal business operations of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary); provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to permit such access or make such disclosure, to the extent it determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that such disclosure or access alone—or taken together with other competitively sensitive information Company has made or will make available to Parent
—would reasonably be likely to (i) violate the terms of any confidentiality agreement or other Contract with a third party (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (A) obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or disclosure or (B) otherwise provide the information in a manner that does not require such consent),
(ii) result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much of it as
possible) in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege), or (iii) violate, or would reasonably be expected to violate, any Law (provided that the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide such access or make such disclosure in a manner that does not violate Law). If any material is withheld by the Company pursuant to
the proviso to the preceding sentence, the Company shall inform Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld. Without limiting the obligations set forth in
Section 7.07 of this Agreement, all information exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.02 shall be subject to the confidentiality agreement, dated as of August 18, 2016, between
Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may, following prior notice and consultation with the Company, disclose to
potential purchasers of any of the Company's or Parent's or their respective Subsidiaries' businesses or other assets in connection with any divestiture obligations and any
representatives of such potential purchasers, such confidential information reasonably related to such businesses or assets to be divested pursuant to Section 7.03(f), subject, to
the extent necessary or reasonably advisable, to appropriate "clean room" arrangements.

        SECTION 7.03    Efforts to Consummate.    

        (a)    Reasonable Best Efforts.    Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, including this Section 7.03, each of the parties agrees to use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable.

        (b)    Filings and Consents.    Parent and the Company shall (i) file as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten Business Days of the execution of this
Agreement, unless a later time is mutually agreed by the parties) with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of
Justice (the "Antitrust Division") the notification and report form required under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

otherwise agreed by the parties) work cooperatively together to prepare and file a draft CFIUS Notice in accordance with 31 C.F.R. Part 800 and customary practice, and
promptly file a final CFIUS Notice in connection with the CFIUS Clearance and in accordance with 31 C.F.R. Part 800 after receipt of confirmation that CFIUS has no
comment on the draft CFIUS Notice, and timely provide any information requested by CFIUS or any other agency or branch of the U.S. government in connection with
CFIUS review or investigation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) promptly assemble and provide the information necessary for Parent to, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and not later than 20 Business Days after the filing of a final CFIUS Notice), prepare and make or cause to be made a
notification under Part III of the ICA with the Investment Review Division of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (the "IRD") with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and timely respond at the earliest practicable date to any requests for additional information made by the IRD or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the notification or any review initiated under the ICA and (iv) as promptly as practicable and advisable, after the date of this Agreement, use
reasonable best efforts to prepare and submit all other filings, notifications, information updates and other presentations required by or in connection with seeking, and
use reasonable best efforts to obtain, all Consents, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, non-actions, exemptions, change of ownership approvals or other
authorizations from any Governmental Entity or other third party (the "Authorizations"), in each case that are reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to assist and cooperate with the other party in connection with the foregoing; provided, that
Parent and the Company shall have no obligation to pay any fee to any third party for the purpose of obtaining any such Authorization, or pay any costs and expenses of
any third party resulting from the process of obtaining such Authorization (without limiting Parent's obligations under Section 7.03(f)), except to the extent that either
party is required by law to pay any filing fees due to any Government Entities reviewing the transaction.

        (c)    Cooperation.    The Company shall not enter into any agreement with the FTC or the Antitrust Division not to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of Parent. Subject to Section 7.06, each of Parent and the Company shall (i) cooperate in all respects with each other
and their respective Representatives in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any proceeding by or before a Governmental Entity, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) promptly inform the other party, or its counsel, upon receipt of any substantive communication received by such party from, or
given by such party to, CFIUS, the IRD, the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity or such private party, in each case, regarding any such filing,
submission, proceeding or the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) permit the other party or its counsel to review and discuss reasonably in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of the other party or its counsel in connection with, any proposed substantive communication to be given by it to CFIUS, the IRD, the FTC, the
Antitrust Division or any such other Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by such private party, any other person; and (iv) to the extent not
prohibited by CFIUS, the IRD, the FTC, the Antitrust Division or such other Governmental Entity, give the other party or its counsel reasonable advance notice of any in-
person meeting, and any conference call that is initiated by such party or scheduled in advance, with such Governmental Entity or such private party and not participate
independently therein without first giving the other party or its counsel reasonable opportunity to attend and participate therein or, in the event such other party or its
counsel does not attend or participate therein, consulting with such other party or its counsel reasonably in advance and considering in good faith the views of such other
party or its counsel in connection therewith. Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this Section 7.03(c) as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Such

materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel (or previously agreed outside consultant, as applicable) of the recipient and shall
not be disclosed by such outside counsel (or previously agreed outside consultant, as applicable) to employees, officers or directors of such outside counsel's client unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Materials provided by a party
to the other party pursuant to this Section 7.03(c) may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
subsidiaries, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address privilege or confidentiality concerns.

        (d)    Settlements and Litigation.    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to the matters covered in this Section 7.03, it is agreed
that Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining CFIUS Clearance, ICA Clearance and any necessary antitrust
or competition clearances; provided, however, that Parent shall consult in advance with the Company and in good faith take the Company's views into account regarding
the overall strategic direction of obtaining CFIUS Clearance, ICA Clearance or antitrust or competition clearance and consult with the Company prior to taking any
material substantive position in any written position, or, to the extent practicable, discussions with any Governmental Entity. The Company shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives to, make any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise engage in negotiations or discussions with any Governmental
Entity with respect to any substantive proposed settlement, consent decree, commitment or remedy, except as specifically requested by or agreed with Parent. Nothing in
this Section 7.03 shall require Parent (or permit the Company or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Parent) to litigate with any Governmental Entity.

        (e)    Additional Information.    Each of Parent and the Company shall comply, as early and completely as practicable and advisable, with any request for additional
information, documents or other materials received by such party or any of its Subsidiaries from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity in
relation to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        (f)    Divestiture Obligations.    Subject to Section 7.03(g), to the extent necessary in order to obtain the requisite Authorizations of Governmental Entities, Parent
shall propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, assignment or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent, or effective as of the Effective Time, the Company, or otherwise offer to take or offer to
commit to take any action which it is lawfully capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action, in each case, as may be required in order
to avoid the commencement of any action by any Governmental Entity to prohibit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the basis of the Antitrust Laws, or
if already commenced, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order issued or imposed on the basis of the
Antitrust Laws so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and in any event, not later than the End Date.

        (g)    Caps on Divestitures.    Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement, including Section 7.03(f), or the "reasonable best efforts" standard
generally, shall require, or be construed to require that Parent take, or cause to be taken, (i) any action with respect to any of the assets or businesses of Parent or of the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries that is not conditioned on consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) any action that would
require Parent to sell, divest, assign, dispose of or hold separate (or effect any other remedy requested by a Governmental Entity in respect of) any assets or businesses of
Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries, or agree to, or enter into any conditions or mitigation agreements or other remedies under Antitrust Laws, the DPA

Section 7.03(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter, as set forth under the heading "Reference Number" for the applicable asset, or to the extent affecting assets not on such
schedule, as reasonably determined by the parties) in excess of $15,000,000 or require divestiture or licensing of either party's brand or related intellectual property except
where such brand or related intellectual property is exclusively used by the party in connection with products manufactured entirely at assets or businesses that are
divested pursuant to Section 7.03(f) ; provided, that, in each case, as between Parent and the Company, Parent shall determine in its sole discretion the assets or businesses
of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to be so sold, divested, assigned, disposed of, held separate or subject to any restriction or limitation.

        (h)    Alternative Proposal.    Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, during the term of this Agreement neither the Company nor any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives shall cooperate with any other Person in seeking regulatory clearance of any Alternative Proposal.

        SECTION 7.04    Public Announcements.    Except with respect to any Adverse Recommendation Change or announcement made with respect to any Alternative Proposal,
Superior Proposal or related matters in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or
other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation except as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law, by court process, or by obligations pursuant to the
requirements of any applicable securities exchange (in which case the disclosing party shall consult with the other parties in advance of such disclosure to the extent practicable
under the circumstances). The Company and Parent agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the
form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Nothing in this Section 7.04 shall limit the ability of any party hereto to make additional disclosures that are consistent in all but de
minimis respects with the prior public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        SECTION 7.05    Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.    

        (a)   Parent agrees that, from and after the Effective Time, it will cause the Company and Company Subsidiaries to provide all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) and any indemnification or other similar agreements between any Company Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand (to the extent disclosed on Section 7.05(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter or otherwise made available to Parent prior to the date
hereof), in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, in accordance with their terms. From and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving
Company to indemnify and hold harmless each individual who was prior to or is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective
Time, serving at the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of another Person (the "Company Indemnified
Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable and documented fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and

described in Section 7.05(d)), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (including with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby)), arising out of
or pertaining to the fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at
the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a director or officer of another Person, in each case, arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in each case, to the extent provided by the Company Charter, the Company By-laws or
the comparable charter or organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement, as applicable, or the terms of any
indemnification or other similar agreement between any Company Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand (to
the extent disclosed on Section 7.05(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter or otherwise made available to Parent prior to the date hereof), as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, as applicable, and in each case subject to applicable Law. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x) each Company Indemnified Party will
be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding from the Surviving Company within twenty Business Days of
receipt by the Surviving Company from the Company Indemnified Party of a request therefor, in each case, to the extent provided by the Company Charter, the Company
By-laws or the comparable charter or organizational documents of the Company Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement, as applicable, or the terms of any
indemnification or other similar agreement between any Company Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand (to
the extent made available to Parent prior to the date hereof), as in effect on the date of this Agreement, as applicable; provided that any person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL or the Surviving Company's certificate of incorporation or by-laws, to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that such person is not entitled to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Company and such Company
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with each other in the defense of any such matter. Section 7.05(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and correct
list of all indemnification or other similar agreements (other than organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) between any Company
Indemnified Party, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

        (b)   In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, the Surviving Company shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company directly or indirectly
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.05.

        (c)   For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall either (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to) cause to be
maintained in effect the policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company or a Company Subsidiary as of the date hereof (true and correct
copies of which that are in effect as of the date of this Agreement have been made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement) or provide substitute policies for
the Company and its current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and officers insurance coverage currently maintained by the
Company, in either case, with amounts not less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, except

required to pay (or Parent be required to cause the Surviving Company to pay) with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year more than 300%
of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement for directors and officers liability insurance (which amount is set
forth in Section 7.05(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter) (the "Maximum Amount"), and if the Surviving Company is unable to obtain the insurance required by this
Section 7.05 it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for the years within such six-year period for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount, in
respect of each policy year within such period. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date Parent may purchase or cause the Company to purchase, at Parent's
option and expense (following reasonable consultation with the Company), "tail" directors and officers liability insurance for a period of six years from and after the
Effective Time for the Company and its current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by the directors and officers insurance currently maintained
by the Company, such tail insurance to provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the insured persons
than the directors and officers liability insurance currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time; provided that in no event shall the total cost of any such tail insurance for the directors and officers liability insurance exceed the Maximum Amount. In
the event that such tail coverage is purchased, the Surviving Company and Parent shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this Section 7.05(c). The
Surviving Company shall maintain such policies in full force and effect during the period of insurance, and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

        (d)   Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 7.05(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit or proceeding, shall notify
Parent and the Surviving Company thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Surviving Company of any liability it may have to such Company Indemnified
Party to the extent such failure does not prejudice the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit or proceeding, Parent or the Surviving Company
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof through counsel (i) with recognized competence and experience in connection with claims, actions, suits or proceedings
of the type involved, and (ii) reasonably acceptable to the Company Indemnified Parties, and neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be liable to such Company
Indemnified Parties for the expenses of other counsel engaged by such Company Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that
pursuant to this Section 7.05(d), (x) the Company Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (y) neither Parent nor the Surviving Company
shall be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent.

        (e)   The provisions of this Section 7.05 (i) shall survive consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
indemnified or insured party (including the Company Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and (iii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

        SECTION 7.06    Transaction Litigation.    In the event that any litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is
brought or threatened against the Company, any Company Subsidiary, or its or their Representatives, by security holders of the Company ("Transaction Litigation"), the
Company shall promptly notify Parent of such litigation (including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and shall keep Parent informed on a current basis
with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in and control the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Without limiting in any way the parties'

financing (such alternative financing, the "Alternate Financing") including using its reasonable best efforts with respect to (i) (other than where the Commitment
Documents have terminated as a result of the consummation of an Alternate Financing or the occurrence of a Commitment Reduction Event) complying with and
maintaining in effect the Commitment Documents, including by complying with any "flex" provisions contained in any fee letter referred to therein in accordance with
the terms thereof and using reasonable best efforts to ensure the accuracy of all representations and warranties and the compliance with all covenants and agreements of
Parent and its Subsidiaries under the Commitment Documents, and (ii) (other than where the Commitment Documents have terminated as a result of the consummation of
an Alternate Financing or the occurrence of a Commitment Reduction Event) satisfying on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining the Financing that are within the
control of Parent and its Subsidiaries and by paying when due any fees or deposits required by the Commitment Documents, the Underwriting Agreement or any fee letter
referred to therein. Other than where the Commitment Documents have terminated as a result of the consummation of an Alternate Financing or the occurrence of a
Commitment Reduction Event, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to timely (A) cause the Financing Sources under the Commitment Documents and the
Underwriting Agreement to fully fund the Financing provided for thereunder and (B) fully enforce its rights under the Commitment Documents and the Underwriting
Agreement in the event of breach or threatened breach by the Financing Sources, in each case, to the extent required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at the Closing. The Financing shall be in an aggregate amount sufficient, together with the Alternate Financing, if any, and any other sources available to
Parent and Merger Sub (including cash balances and borrowings under Parent's corporate debt facilities), to fund the payment of the Merger Consideration and to make
any other payment required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay the related fees and expenses, in each case required to be made on
the Closing Date. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice upon becoming aware of, or receiving notice or other communication with respect to, any material breach
of or default under, or any event or circumstance that (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach of or
default under, the Commitment Documents or the Underwriting Agreement by a party thereto prior to the Closing or any termination, withdrawal or rescission of the
Commitment Documents or the Underwriting Agreement prior to the Closing (other than as a result of consummation of an Alternate Financing or as a result of the
cancellation by Parent of any of the undrawn commitment under the Commitment Documents if, after giving effect to such cancellation, the amount of remaining funding
available to Parent under the Financing and any Alternate Financing, together with any other sources available to Parent (including cash balances and borrowings under
Parent's corporate debt facilities), is sufficient to fund the payment of the Merger Consideration and to make any other payment required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to pay the related fees and expenses, in each case required to be made on the Closing Date ("Commitment Reduction Event")).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of Parent and Merger Sub expressly acknowledges and agrees that neither the availability nor terms of
the Financing or any Alternate Financing are conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, which are subject only to the express conditions set forth in Article III, irrespective

any of the Commitment Documents or the Underwriting Agreement prior to the Closing, or (ii) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision
or remedy under, or replace, any of the Commitment Documents or the Underwriting Agreement; provided, that Parent may amend the Commitment Documents or the
Underwriting Agreement to add Financing Sources, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities or guarantors who have not executed the
Commitment Documents or the Underwriting Agreement as of the date hereof and provided further that Parent may make an amendment or modification to, or obtain or
grant a waiver under, any of the Commitment Documents or the Underwriting Agreement where such amendment, modification or waiver would not have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Parent to obtain any funding under the Financing which Parent requires to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at
the Closing.

        (c)   Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its efforts to consummate the Financing (or any Alternate Financing),
including by providing prompt written notice to the Company (i) of (x) any breach or default (or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened breach or default or event which
with notice or lapse of time or both would reasonably be expected to constitute a default) by any party to any of the Commitment Documents or the Underwriting
Agreement or any actual or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened termination, withdrawal, repudiation or rescission of any of the Commitment Documents other than
as a result of the consummation of an Alternate Financing or the occurrence of a Commitment Reduction Event or (y) any dispute or disagreement between or among
Parent, on the one hand, and the Financing Sources under the Financing on the other hand, with respect to the obligation to fund any of the Financing or the amount of the
Financing to be funded at the Closing, and (ii) if at any time for any reason Parent believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
aggregate amount of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Commitment Documents or the
Underwriting Agreement other than as a result of the consummation of an Alternate Financing or the occurrence of a Commitment Reduction Event.

respective Representatives to use reasonable best efforts to provide, on a timely basis, all cooperation that is reasonably requested by Parent or customary in connection
with the arrangement or consummation of, or the compliance by Parent of its obligations under, the Financing or any Alternate Financing (provided, that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including using its reasonable best efforts to if requested in
writing by Parent, (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable provide (x) such financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested in writing by Parent to enable Parent to consummate, or comply with its obligations under, the Financing or any Alternate
Financing including any such information as is customary to be included in syndication or offering materials contemplated by the Financing or Alternate Financing and

therewith (except with respect to any information provided by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries), and any action taken by any of them at the written
request of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 7.07(d).

        (e)   If prior to the Closing the Financing becomes unavailable for any reason on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Documents or Underwriting
Agreement, other than as a result of the consummation of an Alternate Financing or the occurrence of a Commitment Reduction Event, Parent shall (i) as promptly as
practicable after obtaining Knowledge that such portion has become or is reasonably expected to become unavailable, notify the Company of such unavailability and the

Financing (including the "flex" provisions contained in any fee letter) or on other terms and conditions acceptable to Parent, pursuant to commitment letters (or other
agreements) (complete and correct executed copies of which shall be promptly provided to the Company; provided, that any fee letter (or similar confidential letter) may

contingencies to the funding of the Financing on the Closing Date as set forth in the Commitment Documents or the Underwriting Agreement, respectively, in effect on
the date hereof where such expanded conditions precedent or contingencies would reasonably be expected to make the funding of such Replacement Financing less likely
to occur than would be the case (or would have been the case) in relation to the Financing that has become or is reasonably expected to become unavailable or otherwise
include terms (including any "flex" provisions) that would reasonably be expected to make the funding of such Replacement Financing less likely to occur than would be

the terms "Commitment Documents," "Underwriting Agreement" and "Financing" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or other agreement), underwriting
agreement or commitment or any fee letter referred to in such commitment letter or underwriting agreement with respect to any Replacement Financing arranged in
compliance with this Section 7.07(e) (and any Commitment Documents and Financing remaining in effect at the time in question).

payoff letters with respect to such Indebtedness (each, a "Payoff Letter") in substantially final form and in form and substance customarily provided by the agents of such
Specified Indebtedness with respect to the payoff thereof, which Payoff Letters shall (x) indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all principal, interest,
prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs or other outstanding and unpaid obligations related to such Indebtedness as of the Closing Date, other than any
customary expense reserves or amounts necessary to cash collateralize reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit issued thereunder as set forth in the

do not reduce the benefit available under the severance plan for a period ending twelve months following the Effective Time to a qualified participant as of the Effective
Time, or (ii) suspending or terminating any severance plan beginning twelve months following the Effective Time.

        (b)   From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) to, provide to each
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who is employed immediately following the Effective Time and who remains in the employ of Parent, the Company or any

be, to which such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) for a period from Closing until the earlier of (x) six months following the

prior to the Effective Time; or (B) with respect to Continuing Employees who become eligible to participate in existing benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries during
such period, such benefits as are provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries who participate in such plans.

any such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate; provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to make any Continuing Employees eligible for any
specific Parent Benefit Plan.

        (d)   The provisions of this Section 7.09 are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and shall not create any right in any other person, including any
Continuing Employee or beneficiary thereof. Nothing in this Section 7.09 shall be construed to prevent Parent, the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary thereof from
terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time, or amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Plan.

        (c)   Parent shall pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee if either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to (x) Section 8.01(b)(ii) and the
applicable Legal Restraint giving rise to such termination right is issued under or pursuant to any Antitrust Law or results from a failure to obtain CFIUS Clearance or
(y) Section 8.01(b)(i) and, in either case of clause (x) or (y), on the termination date the only conditions to Closing set forth in Article III that have not been satisfied

results from a failure to obtain CFIUS Clearance); provided, that the Parent Termination Fee shall not be payable to the Company if the Company's breach of this
Agreement was the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, the failure of the conditions set forth in Section 3.01(b) or Section 3.01(c) to be satisfied. The Parent
Termination Fee due under this Section 8.03(c) shall be paid by wire transfer of same-day funds on the Business Day immediately following the date of termination of

expenses reasonably incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby up to a maximum amount of
$18,500,000 (the "Expense Reimbursement"); provided, however, that the maximum amount of the Expense Reimbursement shall be increased to $37,000,000 if this
Agreement is terminated after the Equity Financing Consummation has occurred. The payment of the Expense Reimbursement shall not relieve the Company of any
subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.03(b); provided that the Company shall be entitled to a credit against payment of the Termination
Fee (without interest) in respect of any Expense Reimbursement previously paid. Any Expense Reimbursement shall be paid to Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds
within two Business Days following delivery to the Company of an invoice therefor if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii).

        (e)   Each party acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this Section 8.03 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the other parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the applicable party fails promptly to pay the amount due
pursuant to this Section 8.03, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit, action or other proceeding that results in a Judgment in its favor for
such payment, then in addition to such payment the failing party shall pay to the other party its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, action or other proceeding, together with interest on the amount of such payment from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime interest rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such interest begins accruing, or a lesser rate that is the
maximum permitted by applicable Law. The parties agree that, absent fraud or any Willful Breach of this Agreement by the Company, the payment of the Termination
Fee, together with the Expense Reimbursement owed pursuant to Section 8.03(d) (which amount may be credited against the Termination Fee), shall be the sole and
exclusive monetary remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in the event any such payment
becomes due and payable, and, upon payment of the Termination Fee by the Company and the acceptance of such Termination Fee by Parent, the Company, the
Company's Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders and Representatives shall have no further liability to Parent and Merger Sub
under this Agreement. The parties agree that, absent fraud or any Willful Breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, the payment of the Parent Termination Fee
(together with the reimbursement and indemnification obligations of Parent pursuant to Section 7.07) shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy available to the
Company with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in the event any such payment becomes due and payable, and, upon payment of the
Parent Termination Fee by Parent and the acceptance of such Parent Termination Fee by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, Parent's and Merger Sub's Affiliates and its
and their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders and Representatives shall have no further liability to the Company under this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee are not

which the Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, are due and payable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In no event shall
Parent be obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall require Parent to accept the
Termination Fee or the Company to accept the Parent Termination Fee, or forego their respective right to seek specific performance pursuant to Section 9.10.

LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER ANY APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE.

        SECTION 9.09    Assignment.    Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, delegated or transferred,
directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other parties; provided that the rights,
interests and obligations of Merger Sub may be assigned to another direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent without the consent of the Company; provided, further,
that Parent may assign its rights under this Agreement in connection with any sale or transfer of equity securities of, or any merger, consolidation, change of control or other
business combination involving, Parent provided that such assignment does not relieve Parent of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such
consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

        SECTION 9.10    Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction; Venue.    The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the right of a party to cause the other parties to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. It is agreed that the parties are entitled to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court
referred to in clause (a) below, without proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. In
addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the
State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware),
(b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court and (c) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each party further
agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document on the agent for service in the United States as designated by Parent or the Company, as applicable, shall be
deemed to be effective service of process in the courts described in this Section 9.10 for any legal proceeding brought by the Company against Parent or Parent against the
Company, as applicable, in such courts arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

        SECTION 9.11    Waiver of Jury Trial.    EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE
MERGER OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN

contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights under this Section 9.12 with respect thereto. Upon such

to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) except for Section 7.05, is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto

        (d)   Stockholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies granted with respect to the Subject Shares. By entering into this Agreement, if requested by Parent,
Stockholder agrees to grant a proxy appointing Parent as Stockholder's attorney-in-fact and proxy, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, for and in
Stockholder's name, to vote, express consent or dissent, or otherwise to utilize such voting power solely in the manner contemplated by this Section 3 above as Parent or
its proxy or substitute shall, in Parent's sole discretion, deem proper with respect to the Subject Shares. Any proxy given by Stockholder pursuant to this Section 3(d) will
be irrevocable during the term of this Agreement and to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and will be granted in consideration of Parent entering into this Agreement
and the Merger Agreement and incurring certain related fees and expenses. Any proxy granted by Stockholder shall be revoked upon termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

        4.    Agreement Not to Exercise Appraisal Rights.    Stockholder shall not exercise any rights (including under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law) to
demand appraisal of any Shares that may arise with respect to the Merger.

        5.    Stockholder Capacity.    To the extent that Stockholder is an officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed as preventing or otherwise affecting any actions taken or not taken by Stockholder in Stockholder's capacity as an officer or director of the Company or any of the
Company's Subsidiaries or from fulfilling the duties and obligations of such office (including the performance of obligations required by the fiduciary duties of Stockholder
acting in Stockholder's capacity as an officer or director), and none of such actions (or determinations not to take any action) in such other capacities shall be deemed to constitute
a breach of this Agreement.

        6.    No Solicitation.    Stockholder, solely in Stockholder's capacity as a stockholder of the Company, agrees not to, directly or indirectly, take any action that would violate
Section 6.02 of the Merger Agreement if the Stockholder were deemed a "Representative" of the Company for purposes of such Section 6.02 of the Merger Agreement, provided
that the foregoing shall not serve to limit or restrict any actions taken by Stockholder in any capacity other than as a stockholder of the Company to the extent such actions are
permitted or required under such Section 6.02 of the Merger Agreement. Stockholder further agrees that Stockholder will not, and will cause its representatives not to, solicit,
encourage, cooperate with or assist or participate in or facilitate any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish or cause to be furnished any information with respect to
Stockholder's Company Securities, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any offer or proposal with respect to, or with respect to a Transfer of,
Stockholder's Company Securities, except with respect to any Transfer of Stockholders' Company Securities permitted by the express terms hereof.

        7.    No Ownership Interest.    Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent or Merger Sub any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of
ownership of or with respect to any Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Shares shall remain vested in and belong to Stockholder, and Parent
and Merger Sub shall have no authority to manage, direct, superintend, restrict, regulate, govern, or administer any of the policies or operations of the Company or exercise any
power or authority to direct Stockholder in the voting of any of the Shares, except as otherwise provided herein.

        8.    Representations and Warranties of Stockholder.    Stockholder hereby represents and warrants (solely in Stockholder's capacity as a Company stockholder and/or holder
of Company Stock Options, Company SARs or Company Restricted Shares) to Parent that:

        (a)    Authority; Binding Agreement.    Stockholder has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform Stockholder's obligations

consummation by Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by Stockholder and no other actions or proceedings on the
part of Stockholder are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by Stockholder of this Agreement, the performance by Stockholder of Stockholder's obligations
hereunder or the consummation by Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby. Stockholder has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent, this Agreement constitutes Stockholder's legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against Stockholder in
accordance with its terms except as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity.

        (b)    No Conflicts.    The execution and delivery by Stockholder of this Agreement does not, and the performance by Stockholder of Stockholder's obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, any obligation to make an
offer to purchase or redeem any Indebtedness or capital stock or any loss of a material benefit under, require a consent or waiver under, require the payment of a penalty
or material payment under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Stockholder under, any provision of (i) the Company Charter, the
Company By-laws or the comparable charter or organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary (assuming that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained),
(ii) any Contract to which Stockholder is a party or by which any of Stockholder's properties or assets is bound or (iii) any Judgment or Law, in each case, applicable to
Stockholder or Stockholder's properties or assets (assuming that the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained), other than, in each case, for any matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation by Stockholder of the
obligations of Stockholder contemplated by this Agreement.

        (c)    Ownership of Shares.    As of the date of this Agreement, Stockholder (i) is the Beneficial Owner of the Company Securities as indicated on the signature page
to this Agreement, all of which are free and clear of any Liens (except any Liens arising under securities laws or arising hereunder), and (ii) does not own, beneficially or
otherwise, any Company Securities other than the Company Securities indicated on the signature page to this Agreement. Prior to the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, in the event that Stockholder acquires record or Beneficial Ownership of, or the power to vote or direct the voting of, any additional Company
Securities or other voting interests with respect to the Company, Stockholder shall promptly notify Parent of such acquisition. Such Company Securities or voting
interests shall, without further action of the parties, be deemed Subject Shares and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, and the number of Company Securities
held by Stockholder set forth on the signature page of this Agreement will be deemed amended accordingly and such Company Securities or voting interests shall
automatically become subject to the terms of this Agreement.

        (d)    Voting Power.    Stockholder has and will have sole voting power, sole power of disposition, sole power to demand appraisal rights, sole power to issue
instructions with respect to the matters set forth herein and sole power to agree to all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, in each case with respect to all of the
Subject Shares, with no limitations, qualifications or restrictions on such rights, subject to applicable federal securities laws and the terms of this Agreement.

Restricted Share.

        10.    Disclosure.    Subject to reasonable prior notice and approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Stockholder shall permit and hereby authorizes
Parent to publish and disclose in all documents and schedules filed with the SEC, and any press release or other disclosure document that Parent reasonably determines to be

        11.    Further Assurances.    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Stockholder shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and

        12.    Merger Agreement.    Stockholder hereby acknowledges receipt of, and has had an opportunity to read and understand, the Merger Agreement (including any exhibits
and schedules thereto).

        13.    Termination.    This Agreement shall terminate and shall have no further force or effect as of the earlier to occur of (a) the Expiration Date and (b) the making of any
waiver, amendment or other modification of the Merger Agreement that reduces the amount of, or changes the form or type of, consideration to be received by the holders of
Company Securities in the Merger. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing set forth in this Section 13 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall relieve either party from any liability,
or otherwise limit the liability of either party hereto, for any breach of this Agreement occurring prior to the termination hereof.

        14.    Miscellaneous.

used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive.

         (v)  The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the
application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party
drafting such agreement or document.

        (b)    Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.    This Agreement (i) constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (ii) is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies.

        (c)    Severability.    If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto or such party waives its rights under this Section 14(c) with respect thereto.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled
to the extent possible.

        (d)    Assignment.    Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, delegated or transferred, directly or
indirectly, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

        (e)    Amendment.    This Agreement may be modified, amended or supplemented by the parties hereto at any time only by written agreement of each of the parties
hereto. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

        (f)    Waiver.    The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

        (g)    Specific Performance; Jurisdiction; Venue.    The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that Parent shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement. It is agreed that Parent is entitled to enforce specifically the
performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in clause (i) below, without proof of actual damages (and Stockholder hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which Parent is entitled at Law or in
equity. Stockholder further agrees not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, or to assert
that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. In addition, each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State

        (h)    Other Remedies.    Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

Annex C

November 20, 2016

Lady and Gentlemen:

Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ("Deutsche Bank") has acted as financial advisor to Headwaters Incorporated (the "Company") in connection with the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of November 20, 2016 (the "Merger Agreement"), among the Company, Boral Limited ("Parent"), and Enterprise Merger Sub, Inc., an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), which provides, among other things, for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"), as a result of which the
Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Transaction"). As set forth more fully in the Merger Agreement, as a result of the Transaction, each share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Company Common Stock"), of the Company, other than treasury stock, dissenting shares and shares owned directly by the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Parent (other than Merger Sub), or Merger Sub, will be converted into the right
to receive $24.25 in cash (the "Merger Consideration"). Pursuant to Section 2.01(c) of the Merger Agreement, the holders of Company Common Stock may be paid additional
cash consideration in certain circumstances, as to which we express no opinion.

You have requested our opinion, as investment bankers, as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, excluding Parent and its affiliates.

In connection with our role as financial advisor to the Company, and in arriving at our opinion, we reviewed certain publicly available financial and other information concerning
the Company, and certain internal analyses, financial forecasts and other information relating to the Company prepared by management of the Company. We have also held
discussions with certain senior officers of the Company regarding the businesses and prospects of the Company. In addition, we have (i) reviewed the reported prices and trading
activity for the Company Common Stock, (ii) compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with, to the extent publicly available, similar
information for certain other companies we considered relevant whose securities are publicly traded, (iii) reviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain
recent business combinations which we deemed relevant, (iv) reviewed the Merger Agreement, and (v) performed such other studies and analyses and considered such other
factors as we deemed appropriate.

We have not assumed responsibility for independent verification of, and have not independently verified, any information, whether publicly available or furnished to us,
concerning the Company, including, without limitation, any financial information considered in connection with the rendering of our opinion.

Accordingly, for purposes of our opinion, we have, with your knowledge and permission, assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information. We
have not conducted a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and have not prepared, obtained or reviewed any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the
assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or off-balance-sheet assets or liabilities), of the Company or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor have we
evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company, Parent or the combined company under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. With respect to the
financial forecasts made available to us and used in our analyses, we have assumed with your knowledge and permission that such forecasts have been reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the matters covered thereby. In rendering our opinion, we express
no view as to the reasonableness of such forecasts and projections or the assumptions on which they are based. Our opinion is necessarily based upon economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. We expressly disclaim any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any
change in any fact or matter affecting our opinion of which we become aware after the date hereof.

For purposes of rendering our opinion, we have assumed with your knowledge and permission that, in all respects material to our analysis, the Transaction will be consummated
in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, without any waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement that would be material to our
analysis. We also have assumed with your knowledge and permission that all material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required in connection with the
consummation of the Transaction will be obtained and that in connection with obtaining any necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents, no restrictions,
terms or conditions will be imposed that would be material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory, tax or accounting experts and have relied on the assessments made by the
Company and its other advisors with respect to such issues.

This opinion has been approved and authorized for issuance by a Deutsche Bank fairness opinion review committee and is addressed to, and is for the use and benefit of, the
Board of Directors of the Company in connection with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion is limited to the fairness of the Merger
Consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Parent and its affiliates) as of the date hereof. This opinion does not address
any other terms of the Transaction or the Merger Agreement. You have not asked us to, and this opinion does not, address the fairness of the Transaction, or any consideration
received in connection therewith, to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, nor does it address the fairness of the
contemplated benefits of the Transaction. We express no opinion as to the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction or the relative merits of
the Transaction as compared to any alternative transactions or business strategies. Nor do we express an opinion, and this opinion does not constitute a recommendation, as to
how any holder of shares of Company Common Stock should vote with respect to the Transaction. In addition, we do not express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial
or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation

payable to or to be received by any of the Company's officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the
Merger Consideration or otherwise.

Deutsche Bank will be paid a fee for its services as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which becomes payable upon delivery of
this opinion (or would have become payable if Deutsche Bank had advised the Company that it was unable to render this opinion) and a substantial portion of which is contingent
upon consummation of the Transaction. The Company has also agreed to reimburse Deutsche Bank for its expenses, and to indemnify Deutsche Bank against certain liabilities, in
connection with its engagement. We are an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG (together with its affiliates, the "DB Group"). One or more members of the DB Group have, from time
to time, provided, and may be currently providing, financial services unrelated to the Transaction to Parent or its affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may
receive, compensation. One or more members of the DB Group have, from time to time, provided, and are currently providing, investment banking, commercial banking
(including extension of credit) and other financial services unrelated to the Transaction to the Company or its affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may
receive, compensation, including having acted as administrative agent, arranger and bookrunner under the Company's $425,000,000 term loan facility since March 2015, having
acted as joint arranger and joint bookrunner with respect to a $350,000,000 incremental term loan facility in August 2016 and having acted as co-bookrunner with respect to an
offering of the Company's 71/4% Senior Notes due 2019 (aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000) in December 2013. The DB Group may also provide investment and
commercial banking services to Parent, the Company or their respective affiliates in the future, for which we would expect the DB Group to receive compensation. In the
ordinary course of business, members of the DB Group may actively trade in the securities and other instruments and obligations of Parent, the Company and their respective
affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. Accordingly, the DB Group may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, instruments
and obligations.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions, it is Deutsche Bank's opinion as investment bankers that, as of the date hereof,
the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock, excluding Parent and its affiliates.

Annex D 

Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. 

§ 262 Appraisal rights. 

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to
such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and
who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word
"stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words
"depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251
(other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b) (3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, §257, § 258,
§ 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class
or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of
stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000
holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not
require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a
constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263
and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or
depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000
holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not owned by the
parent immediately prior

to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be available as
contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as
practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent
corporation" and/or "surviving or resulting corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock
as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e) and
(g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the
corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members
who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section
that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall
deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be
sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's
shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written
demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of
each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger
or consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective
date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of
such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares
of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of
the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of
a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of
mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be

sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's
shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second
notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled
to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or
within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of
a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the
sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's
shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice
that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to
receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that
if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is
given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a)
and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a
determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for
appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has
complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or
resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for
appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such
stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for
appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such
stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement
described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days
after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have
demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall
be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give
notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list
at the addresses therein

stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of
Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs
thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The
Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal
rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal
rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery,
including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In
determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as
provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over
the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of
the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in
which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as
determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to
participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an
appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such
stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not
entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled
thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates
upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,
whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a
stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal

proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an
appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be
entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders
of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided
in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal
and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or
thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in
the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems
just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named
party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or
consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
