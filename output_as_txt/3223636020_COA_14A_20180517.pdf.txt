MERGER PROPOSED—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT 

Dear Fellow Stockholder:

        We cordially invite you to attend a special meeting of stockholders of Coastway Bancorp, Inc. ("Coastway Bancorp"). The special meeting will be held at the corporate
headquarters of Coastway Bancorp located at One Coastway Blvd., Warwick, Rhode Island 02886 on June 21, 2018, at 3:30 p.m., local time.

        On March 14, 2018, Coastway Bancorp entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with HarborOne Bancorp, Inc. ("HarborOne Bancorp") and Massachusetts
Acquisitions, LLC, a newly formed subsidiary of HarborOne Bancorp, pursuant to which Massachusetts Acquisitions, LLC will merge with and into Coastway Bancorp, with
Coastway Bancorp as the surviving corporation and, immediately thereafter, Coastway Bancorp will merge with and into HarborOne Bancorp, with HarborOne Bancorp as the
surviving corporation. If the merger is completed, at the closing, your shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock will be converted into the right to receive $28.25 in cash for
each share. Upon completion of the merger, Coastway Bancorp will no longer exist and you will no longer own any stock or have any other interest in Coastway Bancorp.

        At the special meeting, you will be asked to approve: (1) the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 14, 2018, by and among HarborOne Bancorp, Inc., Coastway
Bancorp, Inc. and Massachusetts Acquisitions, LLC (the "Merger Agreement"), and the merger; and (2) any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting, if deemed
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes represented in person or by proxy at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger
Agreement and the merger (the "Adjournment Proposal"). A majority of the shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock outstanding must vote in favor of the Merger Agreement
and the merger for the merger to be completed. If the Merger Agreement and the merger are approved, and all other conditions described in the Merger Agreement have been met
or waived, the merger is expected to close during the second half of 2018.

        Your exchange of shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock for cash generally will cause you to recognize income or loss for federal, and possibly state, local and foreign,
income tax purposes. You should consult your personal tax advisor for a full understanding of the income tax consequences of the merger to you.

        Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger and "FOR" the Adjournment
Proposal, because we believe that the merger is advisable and in the best interests of Coastway Bancorp's stockholders.

        This proxy statement provides you with detailed information about the proposed merger and includes, as Appendix A, a copy of the Merger Agreement. We urge you to read
the enclosed materials carefully for a complete description of the merger.

        Your vote is important. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting, please complete, date and sign the enclosed proxy card and return it promptly in the postage-
paid envelope we have provided. You may also vote your shares by telephone or the Internet following the instructions on the enclosed proxy or voting instruction card. If your
shares are held in an account at a bank, broker or other nominee, you should instruct your bank, broker or nominee how to vote your shares using the separate voting instruction
form furnished by your bank, broker or nominee. Failing to vote will have the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the Merger Agreement and the merger.

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
TO BE HELD ON JUNE 21, 2018

        Notice is hereby given that a special meeting of stockholders of Coastway Bancorp, Inc. ("Coastway Bancorp") will be held at the corporate headquarters of Coastway
Bancorp located at One Coastway Blvd., Warwick, Rhode Island, on June 21, 2018, commencing at 3:30 p.m., local time, and thereafter as it may from time to time be adjourned.

        The meeting is being held:

1. To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 14, 2018, by and among HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.,
Coastway Bancorp, Inc. and Massachusetts Acquisitions, LLC (the "Merger Agreement"), and the merger, as more fully described in the accompanying proxy
statement; and 

2. To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting of stockholders if necessary or appropriate to solicit
additional proxies (the "Adjournment Proposal").

        We are not aware of any other business to come before the special meeting. Any action may be taken on the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and the merger at the
special meeting or on any date or dates to which the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed. You can vote at the special meeting if you owned Coastway Bancorp
common stock at the close of business on May 7, 2018.

        Your vote is very important. We cannot complete the merger unless stockholders of Coastway Bancorp holding a majority of the outstanding shares of Coastway Bancorp
common stock approve the Merger Agreement and the merger. Failure to vote will have the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the Merger Agreement and the merger.

        Regardless of whether you plan to attend the special meeting, please vote as soon as possible. If you hold stock in your name as a stockholder of record, please
complete, sign, date and return the accompanying proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid return envelope, or call the toll-free telephone number or use the Internet by
following the instructions included with your proxy card or voting instruction card. If you hold your stock in "street name" through a bank, broker or other nominee,
please direct your bank, broker or other nominee to vote in accordance with the instructions you have received from your bank, broker or other nominee. This will not
prevent you from voting in person, but it will help to secure a quorum and avoid added solicitation costs. Any record holder of Coastway Bancorp common stock who is present
at the special meeting may vote in person instead of by proxy, thereby canceling any previous proxy. In any event, a proxy may be revoked as more fully described in the
accompanying proxy statement at any time before it is voted.

        The enclosed document provides a detailed description of the merger, the Merger Agreement and related matters. We urge you to carefully read the document, and its
appendices in their entirety. If you have any questions concerning the merger, the Merger Agreement or the proxy statement, would like additional copies of the proxy statement
or need help voting your shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock, please contact Coastway Bancorp's proxy solicitor:

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING 

Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement and proxy card? 

A: You are being asked to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of March 14, 2018 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.
("HarborOne Bancorp"), Coastway Bancorp, Inc. ("Coastway Bancorp") and Massachusetts Acquisitions, LLC, as well as the merger between Coastway Bancorp
and Massachusetts Acquisitions, LLC. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Appendix A. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of
the Merger Agreement, Massachusetts Acquisitions, LLC, which has been formed as a subsidiary of HarborOne Bancorp to facilitate the merger, will merge with
and into Coastway Bancorp, with Coastway Bancorp as the surviving corporation. Immediately thereafter, Coastway Bancorp will merge with and into HarborOne
Bancorp, with HarborOne Bancorp as the surviving corporation. Contemporaneously, Coastway Community Bank, the wholly-owned bank subsidiary of Coastway
Bancorp, will merge with and into HarborOne Bank, the wholly-owned bank subsidiary of HarborOne Bancorp, with HarborOne Bank as the surviving bank. Each
outstanding common share of Coastway Bancorp will be converted into the right to receive $28.25 in cash at closing. As a result of the mergers and the bank
merger, Coastway Bancorp and Coastway Community Bank will no longer exist as separate legal entities.

You are also being asked to approve the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting of stockholders if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional
proxies.

Q: What do I need to do now? 

A: After you have carefully read this proxy statement, including the appendices, and have decided how you wish to vote your shares, please vote your shares promptly
so that your shares are represented and voted at the special meeting.

If you hold stock in your name as a stockholder of record, indicate on your proxy card how you want your shares to be voted or, if you prefer, you can vote by
using the telephone or Internet. If you choose not to vote by telephone or Internet, then sign, date and mail your proxy card in the enclosed prepaid return envelope
as soon as possible. This will enable your shares to be represented and voted at the special meeting. If you hold your stock in "street name" through a bank, broker
or other nominee, you must direct your bank, broker or other nominee to vote in accordance with the instructions you have received from your bank, broker or
other nominee. "Street name" stockholders who wish to vote at the special meeting in person will need to obtain a proxy form from the institution that holds their
shares.

If you are a participant in the Coastway Community Bank 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the "401(k) Plan") or the Coastway Community Bank Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (the "ESOP"), you will have received voting instruction forms that reflect all shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock for which you may direct
the voting under these plans. Under the terms of these plans, the trustee votes all shares held by the plan, but each participant may provide instructions to the trustee
how to vote the shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock allocated to his or her plan account. The trustee will vote your shares in accordance with your
instructions, and will vote the ESOP unallocated shares and shares for which no voting instructions were received in the same proportion as the instructions
received from participants. The deadline for returning your voting instructions is 1:00 a.m. on June 19, 2018.

Q: Does the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors support the merger? 

A: Yes. The Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the merger. The Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors
unanimously recommends that you vote

"FOR" each of the proposals. Additionally, Coastway Bancorp's directors and certain executive officers have entered into voting agreements with HarborOne
Bancorp pursuant to which they have agreed to vote all of their shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock over which they have sole voting power in favor of the
Merger Agreement and the merger.

Q: Do any of Coastway Bancorp's directors or executive officers have interests in the merger that differ from those of Coastway Bancorp stockholders? 

A: Yes, Coastway Bancorp's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of Coastway Bancorp
stockholders generally. These interests are discussed under the section entitled "Proposal 1—Approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger—Financial
Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" of this proxy statement. Coastway Bancorp's Board of Directors was aware of and considered such
interests, among other matters, in evaluating the Merger Agreement and the merger and in recommending that Coastway Bancorp stockholders approve the merger
agreement. 

Q: What is the vote required to approve the matters to be considered at the special meeting? 

A: Approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock as of
the close of business on May 7, 2018, the record date for the special meeting. Failing to vote will have the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the Merger
Agreement and the merger. Approval of the Adjournment Proposal will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares as of the close of business on May 7,
2018 cast at the special meeting. 

Q: Why is my vote important? 

A: If you do not return your proxy card or vote by telephone, Internet or in person at the special meeting or fail to instruct your bank, broker or nominee how to vote,
it will be more difficult and expensive for us to obtain the necessary quorum to hold our special meeting. In addition, your failure to vote or failure to instruct your
bank, broker or other nominee how to vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger. The Merger
Agreement and the merger must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock. 

Q: If my broker holds my shares in street name, will my broker automatically vote my shares for me? 

A: No. Your broker will not be able to vote your shares without instructions from you. You should instruct your broker to vote your shares, following the procedures
your broker provides to you. 

Q: What if I abstain from voting or fail to instruct my broker? 

A: If you abstain from voting or fail to instruct your broker to vote your shares, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Merger Agreement and the
merger. However, abstentions will be counted toward a quorum at the special meeting. Abstentions will not affect the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal. 

Q: Can I attend the special meeting and vote my shares in person? 

A: Yes. All stockholders are invited to attend the special meeting. Stockholders of record can vote in person at the special meeting. If your shares are held in street
name, then you are not the stockholder of record and you must ask your bank, broker or other nominee how you can vote at the special meeting.

Table of Contents

Q: Can I change my vote? 

A: Yes, you can change your vote at any time before your vote is counted at the special meeting. If you have not voted through your bank, broker or other nominee,
there are five ways you can change your vote after you have sent in your proxy card: 

• First, you may send a written notice to our Corporate Secretary, stating that you would like to revoke your proxy. 

• Second, you may complete and submit a new proxy card. Any earlier proxies will be revoked automatically. 

• Third, you may attend the special meeting and vote in person. Any earlier-dated proxy will be revoked. However, simply attending the special meeting
without voting will not revoke your proxy. 

• Fourth, you can change your vote at the Internet address shown on your proxy card. The Internet voting system is available 24 hours a day until 1:00 a.m.,
Eastern Time, on June 21, 2018. 

• Fifth, you can change your vote by using the toll-free telephone number shown on your proxy card. The telephone voting system is available 24 hours a day
in the United States until 1:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on June 21, 2018.

If you have directed your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares, you must follow directions you receive from your bank, broker or nominee to change
your vote.

Q: Will I have the right to have my shares appraised if I dissent from the merger? 

A: No. Pursuant to Maryland law, Coastway Bancorp stockholders do not have appraisal rights with respect to the merger. 

Q: What should I do if I hold my shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock in book-entry form? 

A: Other than completing and delivering a letter of transmittal to HarborOne Bancorp's exchange agent following completion of the merger, you are not required to
take any specific actions if you hold your shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock in book-entry form. After the completion of the merger, shares of Coastway
Bancorp common stock held in book-entry form for which properly completed and delivered letters of transmittal have been received by HarborOne Bancorp's
exchange agent will automatically be exchanged for cash and sent to stockholders. 

Q: Should I send in my stock certificate(s) now? 

A: No. Instructions for surrendering the certificate(s) representing your shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock in exchange for the cash purchase price will be
sent to you later. If your shares of common stock are held in "street name" by your bank, broker or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your bank,
broker or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to receive the cash purchase price. Please do not send any stock certificates with your proxy
card. 

Q: Will I owe income taxes as a result of the merger? 

A: Only if you recognize taxable gain. The receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and foreign income or other tax laws). In
general, you will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash you receive in the merger and the adjusted tax basis of your shares of
Coastway

        This is a summary of selected key terms of the transaction between Coastway Bancorp and HarborOne Bancorp. It may not contain all of the information that is important to
you. We urge you to read carefully this entire document, including the appendices, and the other documents to which we refer, to fully understand the merger. Each item in this
summary refers to the page of this proxy statement on which the subject is discussed in more detail.

What Coastway Bancorp Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger (page 43) 

        If the merger occurs, each Coastway Bancorp stockholder will receive, for each share of Coastway Bancorp common stock that they own, the right to receive $28.25 in cash
at closing. See the discussion under the section entitled "Proposal 1—Approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger—Terms of The Merger Agreement" for more
information. At the effective time of the merger, each share of common stock held by the ESOP and the 401(k) Plan also will be converted into the right to receive $28.25 in cash
at closing. At the effective time of the merger, each restricted stock award will become fully vested and will be converted into the right to receive $28.25 in cash at closing. Each
outstanding Coastway Bancorp stock option will vest at the effective time of the merger and will be converted to the right to receive a cash payment equal to the amount by
which $28.25 exceeds the exercise price of such option. If the exercise price of a stock option equals or exceeds $28.25 per share, the holder of such stock option will not be
entitled to any consideration.

Vote Required to Approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger; Coastway Bancorp's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Board of Directors
(pages 21 and 51) 

        The merger cannot occur unless (i) Coastway Bancorp's stockholders approve the Merger Agreement and the merger by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock, (ii) all regulatory and other approvals necessary to complete the merger are obtained, and (iii) other conditions to the merger are
satisfied or waived. See the discussion under the section entitled "Proposal 1—Approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger—Conditions to Complete the Merger" for
more information.

        The Board of Directors of Coastway Bancorp has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the merger and unanimously recommends that Coastway
Bancorp's stockholders vote "FOR" the Merger Agreement and the merger. In reaching its decision, the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors considered a number of
factors, which are described in the section entitled "Proposal 1—Approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger—Coastway Bancorp's Reasons for the Merger and
Recommendation of the Board of Directors that Coastway Bancorp Stockholders Vote "FOR" Approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger."

        The Board of Directors also unanimously recommends that Coastway Bancorp stockholders vote "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal.

Opinion of Coastway Bancorp's Financial Advisor (page 23 and Appendix B) 

        On March 12, 2018, Coastway Bancorp's financial advisor, Sandler O'Neill & Partners, L.P. ("Sandler O'Neill"), delivered a written opinion to the Coastway Bancorp Board
of Directors to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the factors considered, assumptions made and qualifications and limitations as set forth
in the opinion, the merger consideration in the proposed merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to Coastway Bancorp common stockholders. The full text of the Sandler
O'Neill written opinion, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion,
is attached to this document as Appendix B. Coastway Bancorp stockholders are urged to read the opinion carefully in its entirety. The Sandler O'Neill written opinion is
addressed to the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors, speaks only as to the fairness of the merger consideration in the merger, and does not constitute a recommendation as to
how any Coastway

Bancorp stockholder should vote with respect to the Merger Agreement and the merger or any other proposal.

Required Regulatory Approvals (page 42) 

        Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the merger cannot be completed unless Coastway Bancorp and HarborOne Bancorp first obtain the approval of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks (the "Massachusetts Commissioner"), the Rhode Island Department of Business
Regulation (the "RIDBR") and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board").

        HarborOne Bancorp and HarborOne Bank have filed the required regulatory applications with the FDIC, the Massachusetts Commissioner, the RIDBR and the Federal
Reserve Board. Although we do not know of any reason why the regulatory approvals would not be obtained in a timely manner, we cannot be certain, when or if, such approvals
will be obtained.

Conditions to Completing the Merger (page 51) 

        We expect to complete the merger during the second half of 2018. As more fully described in this proxy statement and in the Merger Agreement, the completion of the
merger depends on a number of conditions being satisfied or, where legally permissible, waived. These conditions include, among others:

• the approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby by Coastway Bancorp's stockholders; 

• the receipt of required regulatory approvals, none of which imposes any term, condition or restriction that would be materially burdensome to HarborOne Bancorp
or its subsidiaries; 

• there must not be any order, decree or injunction that enjoins, prohibits, materially restricts or makes illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement; 

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties made by the parties in the Merger Agreement as of the closing date of the merger, subject to the materiality
standards and other limitations and qualifications provided in the Merger Agreement, and the performance by the parties, in all material respects, of all obligations
required to be performed by each of them at or before the effective time of the merger under the Merger Agreement; and 

• from the date of the Merger Agreement to the closing, there must not have been any "material adverse effect" on the financial condition, assets or business of
Coastway Bancorp or Coastway Community Bank.

        We cannot be certain when, or if, the conditions to the merger will be satisfied or waived, or that the merger will be completed.

Termination and Termination Fee (pages 51 and 52) 

        The Merger Agreement may be terminated by mutual written consent of HarborOne Bancorp and Coastway Bancorp at any time before the completion of the merger.
Additionally, subject to conditions and circumstances described in the Merger Agreement, HarborOne Bancorp or Coastway Bancorp may terminate the Merger Agreement if,
among other things, any of the following occur:

• the merger has not been consummated by December 31, 2018 and the terminating party is not in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in the Merger Agreement; 

• there is a breach by the other party of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in the Merger Agreement, which cannot be cured, or has not
been cured within the earlier of 30 days of written notice of the breach or December 31, 2018;

• a required regulatory approval is denied or imposes any term, condition or restriction that would be materially burdensome to HarborOne Bancorp or its
subsidiaries, or any governmental authority issues an order, decree or injunction that enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement; or 

• Coastway Bancorp stockholders do not approve the Merger Agreement and the merger at the special meeting of stockholders.

        HarborOne Bancorp may terminate the Merger Agreement unilaterally if Coastway Bancorp breaches its covenant not to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third
parties, or if the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors does not recommend that Coastway Bancorp stockholders vote to approve the Merger Agreement and the merger. In
addition, Coastway Bancorp may terminate the Merger Agreement unilaterally if it has received a superior acquisition proposal from a third party and withdraws, modifies or
changes, in any manner adverse to HarborOne Bancorp, its recommendation that Coastway Bancorp stockholders vote to approve the Merger Agreement and followed certain
specified procedures in the Merger Agreement.

        Under certain circumstances described in the Merger Agreement, including in the case of unilateral termination of the Merger Agreement by Coastway Bancorp under the
circumstances described above, Coastway Bancorp may be required to pay to HarborOne Bancorp a $5.025 million termination fee in connection with the termination of the
Merger Agreement.

Coastway Bancorp's Executive Officers and Directors Have Financial Interests That Are Different from Yours (page 37) 

        In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Coastway Bancorp to approve the Merger Agreement and the merger, you should be aware that certain
interests of executive officers and directors of Coastway Bancorp and Coastway Community Bank in the merger are somewhat different from, or in addition to, your interests as
Coastway Bancorp stockholders. These interests include the following:

• William A. White, President and Chief Executive Officer of Coastway Bancorp and Coastway Community Bank, serves under an employment agreement entered
into with Coastway Community Bank that provides for five years of continued base salary and benefits in the event of an involuntary termination without cause or
a resignation for good reason in connection with a change in control. Immediately prior to entering into the Merger Agreement, Mr. White entered into an
employment agreement with HarborOne Bancorp and HarborOne Bank, which will become effective upon the closing of the merger, pursuant to which he will
serve as the Director of Banking, Rhode Island. Under the new employment agreement, Mr. White will receive a base salary of $440,000 per year for a term of
five years and will be entitled to incentive compensation and fringe benefits substantially similar to those he receives from Coastway. At the effective time of the
merger, his employment agreement with Coastway Community Bank will terminate. In the event of Mr. White's termination without cause or resignation for good
reason while employed by HarborOne Bancorp, he will be entitled payments as described in the Section titled "Proposal 1—Approval of The Merger Agreement
and the Merger—Financial Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger"; 

• severance benefits payable to Richard H. Petrarca, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Jeanette Fritz, Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer, under the Coastway Community Bank Executive Change in Control Severance Plan; 

• HarborOne Bank has made offers of employment to Stephen J. Gibbons, Jana Planka and Suzanne Fry and has provided each executive with a letter agreement
setting forth the terms of his or her employment offer. Each of these executives has accepted the offers set forth in his or her letter agreement. The letter agreement
for Jana Planka offers her the position of Vice President and Regional Manager at an annual salary of $180,000, cash incentive compensation

and benefits comparable to those provided to other similarly situated employees. It is contemplated that Ms. Planka's position will not be comparable to the one
she holds at Coastway Community Bank and that she is entitled to a payment from Coastway Community Bank of approximately $409,390 at closing.
Mr. Gibbons' letter agreement offers him the position of Regional Vice President at an annual salary of $275,000, cash incentive compensation payable in the form
of bonus or commission payments and benefits comparable to those provided to other similarly situated employees at HarborOne Bank. Ms. Fry's letter agreement
offers her the position of Vice President, Regional Sales Manager of HarborOne Mortgage at an annual salary of $150,000 and benefits comparable to those
provided to other comparably positioned HarborOne Mortgage employees. In addition, under the letter agreement, Ms. Fry will be entitled to receive, on a
monthly basis, commissions for all new loans closed in her region or any refinancing of any existing Coastway or HarborOne Mortage loans. In the event of
Mr. Gibbons' or Ms. Fry's involuntary termination by HarborOne Bancorp or HarborOne Mortgage or resignation upon the occurrence of a qualifying
circumstance after closing, they will be entitled, upon execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, to severance payments as described in the Section titled
"Proposal 1—Approval of The Merger Agreement and the Merger—Financial Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger";

• the cash payment to holders of outstanding stock options previously granted by Coastway Bancorp equal to the difference between the option exercise price and
$28.25, and the vesting of all restricted stock awards at the effective time of the merger; 

• a cash payment, payable at closing, representing a pro-rata portion of the cash bonus that would have been payable for the year to eligible employees, including
Messrs. White, Petrarca, and Gibbons and Mses. Fritz, Fry and Planka. The aggregate cash payment to the executive officers and Ms. Fry is estimated to be
approximately $150,821; 

• HarborOne Bancorp's agreement to honor and assume Coastway Community Bank's supplemental retirement plans, which for certain executive officers provide
for accelerated and enhanced retirement benefits in connection with a change in control, such as the merger; 

• the rights of officers and directors of Coastway Bancorp and its subsidiaries to continued indemnification coverage and coverage under directors' and officers'
liability insurance policy; and 

• Coastway Bancorp has agreed to recommend to the Board of Directors of the Coastway Cares Charitable Foundation II (the "Foundation") that the current Board
of Directors of the Foundation resign as of the closing of the merger and that, following the completion of the merger, the Board of Directors of the Foundation
consist of two representatives of HarborOne Bancorp and two representatives of Coastway Bancorp, including Mr. White.

        See the discussion under the section entitled "Proposal 1—Approval of The Merger Agreement and the Merger—Financial Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger" for more information.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences to Coastway Bancorp Stockholders (page 35) 

        The receipt of the merger consideration in exchange for shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction to Coastway
Bancorp stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and may be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and foreign income or other tax laws). For U.S. federal
income tax purposes, each Coastway Bancorp stockholder generally will recognize gain or loss at the effective time of the merger equal to the per share difference, if any,
between: (1) $28.25 and (2) the stockholder's adjusted tax basis in each share of Coastway Bancorp common stock exchanged in the merger. The federal income tax
consequences described above may not apply to all holders of Coastway Bancorp common stock. Your tax consequences will depend on your individual situation.
Accordingly, you should consult your tax advisor for a full understanding of the particular tax consequences of the merger to you.

        This proxy statement, and the documents that we refer to in this proxy statement, contain forward-looking statements intended to be covered by the safe harbor for forward-
looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may include, among other things, information concerning
possible or assumed future results of operations of Coastway Bancorp or HarborOne Bancorp, the expected completion and timing of the merger and other information relating to
the merger. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as "believe," "plan," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "continue," "remain," "will," "should," "may,"
"estimate" or other similar expressions. You should be aware that forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking
statements reflect our current expectations and forecasts, and we cannot assure you that the actual results or developments we anticipate will be realized, or even if realized, that
they will have the expected effects on the business or operations of Coastway Bancorp. In addition to other factors and matters discussed in this proxy statement or discussed and
identified in other public filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we believe the following risks could cause actual results to differ materially from those
discussed in the forward-looking statements:

• failure of the parties to satisfy the conditions to complete the merger in a timely manner or at all; 

• failure of the Coastway Bancorp stockholders to approve the merger; 

• failure to obtain governmental approvals or the imposition of adverse regulatory conditions in connection with such approvals; 

• the merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of unexpected factors or events; 

• attrition in key client, partner and other relationships leading up to and following the merger may be greater than expected; 

• increases in competitive pressure among financial institutions or from non-financial institutions; 

• changes in the interest rate environment; 

• changes in deposit flows, loan demand, asset quality or real estate values; 

• changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines; 

• changes in laws or regulations; 

• governmental and public policy changes, including changes that could subject the parties to additional regulatory oversight, which may result in increased
compliance costs; 

• changes in general economic conditions or conditions in securities markets or the banking industry; 

• materially adverse changes in the financial condition of Coastway Bancorp, Coastway Community Bank, HarborOne Bancorp or HarborOne Bank; and 

• changes in other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, geopolitical and technological factors affecting operations, pricing and services.

executed proxy will be voted "FOR" the proposals identified in the preceding Notice of Special Meeting of Stockholders. Returning a proxy card will not
prevent you from voting in person if you attend the special meeting. 

4. In person. You may attend the special meeting and vote in person. If you are a stockholder whose shares are not registered in your own name, you will need an
assignment of voting rights or a proxy from the stockholder of record to vote personally at the special meeting.

        If your shares are held in "street name" by your bank, broker or other nominee you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares using the
instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you have not received these voting instructions or require further information regarding these voting instructions,
please contact your bank, broker or other nominee to obtain directions on how to vote your shares.

shares with respect to the approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger (i.e., "broker non-votes"). Shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock held by persons attending the
special meeting but not voting, or shares for which we have received proxies with respect to which holders have abstained from voting, will be considered abstentions.

        At the special meeting, our stockholders will be entitled to cast one vote per share of common stock owned on May 7, 2018. Such vote may be exercised in person or by
properly executed proxy. The presence, in person or by properly executed proxy, of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote is necessary to
constitute a quorum. Abstentions will be treated as shares present at the special meeting in determining the presence of a quorum.

        The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock is required to approve the Merger Agreement and the merger. As a result,
abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes "AGAINST" the approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger. Approval of the Adjournment Proposal
will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares cast at the special meeting. Broker non-votes and abstentions from voting will have no effect on the outcome of the
vote on the Adjournment Proposal.

        Approval of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders is a condition to completion of the merger. See "Proposal 1—Approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger—
Conditions to Complete the Merger."

Beneficial Ownership of Coastway Bancorp Common Stock 

        As of May 7, 2018, our directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned in the aggregate 159,382 shares of our common stock, excluding stock
options, or 3.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock. The Coastway Bancorp directors and certain executive officers, solely in their capacity as Coastway Bancorp
stockholders, have each entered into a separate voting agreement with HarborOne Bancorp, pursuant to which each such director and executive officer has agreed to vote all
shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock over which he or she exercises sole voting power in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger and certain
related matters and against alternative transactions.

Proxies; Revocation 

        Shares of our common stock represented by properly executed proxies received before or at the special meeting will, unless such proxies have been revoked, be voted at the
special meeting and any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated in the proxies. If no instructions are indicated on a
properly executed and dated proxy, the shares will be voted "FOR" the approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger and "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal.

        Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before it is voted in the following manner: (1) by delivering to the Corporate
Secretary of Coastway Bancorp, before the votes are counted at the special meeting, a written notice of revocation; (2) by duly executing a later-dated proxy relating to the same
shares of common stock and delivering it to the Corporate Secretary at or before the special meeting; (3) by attending the special meeting and voting in person (attendance at the
special meeting will not by itself constitute a revocation of a proxy); (4) by changing your vote at the Internet address shown on your proxy card; or (5) by using the toll-free
telephone number shown on your proxy card. The Internet voting system and toll-free telephone voting system will be available 24 hours a day until 1:00 a.m., Eastern time, on
June 21, 2018.

PROPOSAL 1—APPROVAL OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER 

        The information in this proxy statement concerning the terms of the merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is
attached as Appendix A, which is incorporated by reference herein. We encourage all stockholders to read the Merger Agreement. All information contained in this proxy
statement with respect to HarborOne Bancorp and its subsidiaries has been supplied by HarborOne Bancorp for inclusion herein and has not been independently verified by
Coastway Bancorp.

General 

        As soon as possible after the conditions to consummation of the merger described herein have been satisfied or waived, and unless the Merger Agreement has been
terminated as discussed herein, Massachusetts Acquisitions, LLC, the merger subsidiary of HarborOne Bancorp, will merge with and into Coastway Bancorp, with Coastway
Bancorp as the surviving corporation, and, at the closing, each of the outstanding shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock will be converted into the right to receive $28.25 in
cash. Immediately following the merger, Coastway Bancorp will merge with and into HarborOne Bancorp, with HarborOne Bancorp as the surviving corporation.
Contemporaneously, Coastway Community Bank will merge with and into HarborOne Bank, with HarborOne Bank as the surviving bank.

Background of the Merger 

        Coastway Bancorp converted from a mutual holding company structure (meaning no public stockholders) to a fully-public stock holding company when it completed its
initial public offering in January 2014. Since that time, Coastway Bancorp has managed its capital through organic growth and stock repurchase programs. In addition, the
Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors has considered various strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value, including potential acquisitions of other financial institutions,
strategic partnerships and capital raising transactions such as offering subordinated debt. Pursuant to federal banking regulations, Coastway Bancorp was generally prohibited
from entering into a sale of control transaction for three years following its conversion to stock form. That prohibition ended in January 2017.

        From time to time throughout 2017, Coastway Bancorp's President and Chief Executive Officer, William A. White, received calls from several financial institutions in the
New England region expressing an interest in potentially pursuing a strategic partnership with Coastway Bancorp. On several occasions, Mr. White attended informal meetings
with representatives of such entities, primarily to learn more about the business of each. In particular, the Chief Executive Officer of Company A, a local community banking
institution, expressed continued interest throughout 2017.

        Periodically, at regularly scheduled meetings of the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors, Mr. White updated the Board on communications received from the various
financial institutions. In a telephone conference call on September 6, 2017, Mr. White relayed his conversations with the Chief Executive Officer of Company A to the Board of
Directors. Mr. White believed that a potential combination between the two parties could create a larger more diversified local banking institution that would be better able to
compete in Coastway Bancorp's geographic market area while minimizing employee layoffs. Mr. White also believed Company A had the ability to offer a strong price for
Coastway Bancorp stockholders. Based on the information provided by Mr. White and the Board's knowledge of the business of Company A, the Board of Directors determined
that further discussions with Company A regarding a strategic transaction were merited, and authorized Mr. White to enter into a nondisclosure agreement with Company A to
permit Company A and Coastway Bancorp to learn more about each other.

        On September 8, 2017, Coastway Bancorp and Company A entered into a nondisclosure agreement that contained customary standstill provisions. Mr. White again met with
the Chief Executive Officer of Company A on September 15, 2017. There was general discussion regarding each entity's culture, philosophy and customer service approach and
the benefits of a possible transaction; however, no specific transaction terms were discussed. The Chief Executive Officer of Company A advised that any potential merger
consideration would be 100% cash. Mr. White and the Chief Executive Officer of Company A agreed to continue discussions.

        On September 29, 2017, Mr. White attended an informal meeting at the invitation of a representative of Company B, a New England regional banking institution, to discuss
their respective franchises and opportunities for a combined institution. Mr. White agreed that an additional meeting with Company B for further discussions in the future could
be warranted.

        On October 12, 2017, the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors held its annual strategic meeting. The Board of Directors invited a representative of Sandler O'Neill &
Partners, L.P. ("Sandler O'Neill"), an investment banking firm that specializes in representing financial institutions, to update the Board of Directors on the banking industry and
the merger and acquisitions market. In addition, representatives of Coastway Bancorp's legal counsel, Luse Gorman, PC ("Luse Gorman") also attended the meeting.
Representatives of Luse Gorman gave a presentation and discussed Coastway Bancorp directors' fiduciary duties, specifically in the context of a change-in-control transaction.
Luse Gorman noted that, in a merger transaction in which the consideration consists primarily of cash, a corporation should conduct at least a limited market review of potential
acquirers to evaluate the price being offered to stockholders.

        Representatives of Sandler O'Neill discussed Coastway Bancorp's business, market and stock performance, both historically and in comparison to peer institutions. As in
past strategic planning sessions, representatives of Sandler O'Neill provided the Board of Directors with a range of potential valuations for Coastway Bancorp on a stand-alone
basis, using various valuation methodologies, as well as a range of potential valuations on a change-in-control basis, using recent bank holding company merger transactions. At
the request of Coastway Bancorp's Board of Directors and management, representatives of Sandler O'Neill also provided pro forma information reflecting a possible merger
transaction with Company A utilizing certain transaction assumptions, as provided by Coastway Bancorp's management. The Board then discussed the merits of different
opportunities available to Coastway Bancorp, including continued organic growth, combining with a larger financial institution such as Company A, or acquiring a smaller
financial institution. The Board agreed that Mr. White should primarily continue to explore the possibility of a merger with Company A, but could also continue to have
discussions with other banks if contacted. Mr. White agreed to update the Board on the status of all discussions.

        On October 17, 2017, the Chief Executive Officer of Company A notified Mr. White that Company A had engaged an investment banking firm to represent them in a
possible transaction. Mr. White advised that the investment banking firm contact representatives of Sandler O'Neill so that the two parties could begin to work on the parameters
of a possible transaction.

        On October 26, 2017, Mr. White met with the Chief Executive Officer and another executive of Company B to discuss the potential benefits of a combination of the two
companies. The Chief Executive Officer of Company B expressed uncertainty about the potential synergies of a combined company. In particular, he noted that Coastway
Bancorp had a significant mortgage banking business, which did not complement Company B's loan portfolio or current business plan.

        On October 27, 2017, Company A submitted a non-binding written indication of interest in which it expressed an interest in pursuing a strategic combination. The letter
discussed the merits of a combined institution, including the creation of a larger local, community-focused banking institution, the structure of a potential transaction, the
management of the resulting institution, including a

proposal to appoint at least one Coastway Bancorp director to the board of the resulting institution. Company A indicated that the proposed merger consideration would consist of
100% cash but did not provide any specific information regarding pricing. However, the letter stated that such price would be at a meaningful premium to Coastway Bancorp' s
current trading price. The indication of interest was subject to the completion of a satisfactory due diligence examination of Coastway Bancorp. Company A also requested that
Coastway Bancorp enter into an approximately 60-day exclusivity agreement.

        On October 31, 2017, Mr. White met with the Chief Executive Officer of Company C, a New England regional banking institution, which meeting was initiated by
Company C. The parties discussed their respective corporate cultures, business prospects, and the potential synergies to be achieved in a potential business combination.
Mr. White agreed to stay in contact with Company C if Coastway Bancorp decided to consider a strategic transaction in the future.

        On November 9, 2017, Mr. White met with the Chief Executive Officer of Company A, where a detailed discussion regarding the non-binding indication of interest took
place, including about the business of each entity and the structure of the proposed merger. Mr. White noted that in order for the process to move forward, Company A would
need to propose a price range for the Coastway Bancorp Board to consider. Mr. White also advised the Chief Executive Officer of Company A that, upon receipt of an acquisition
proposal from Company A that included pricing information, Coastway Bancorp intended to perform a market check by contacting a limited number of financial institutions to
solicit alternative acquisition proposals in order to confirm that the pricing proposed by Company A was the best price reasonably available and thus in the best interests of
Coastway Bancorp stockholders. Accordingly, Coastway Bancorp would be unable to sign any exclusivity agreement with Company A until it had completed its market check.
The Chief Executive Officer of Company A agreed to work with its financial advisor on a price range and would conduct limited due diligence of Coastway Bancorp based on its
public filings.

        At the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors' regularly scheduled meeting on November 21, 2017, Mr. White updated the Board on the progress of his discussions with
Company A.

        On December 8, 2017, Mr. White met again with the Chief Executive Officer of Company A to discuss the potential transaction between Company A and Coastway
Bancorp. The parties discussed the composition of the management team and the board of directors of the resulting institution and certain employee matters. Although no specific
price proposal was discussed, the Chief Executive Officer of Company A indicated again Company A's intent to pay a competitive price, which it indicated would be an above-
average price based on the metrics of recent mergers involving similarly-sized financial institutions in the New England region. He also advised Mr. White that Company A
intended to imminently provide Coastway Bancorp a price range in the form of a revised non-binding indication of interest.

        At the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors' regularly scheduled meeting on December 21, 2017, Mr. White updated the Board on the progress of his discussions with
Company A. Representatives of Sandler O'Neill and Luse Gorman also participated in the meeting. Subsequently, upon the advice of the Board, Mr. White requested that
Company A submit its revised indication of interest that included pricing details during the first week of January 2018. Company A agreed to the proposed timeline. The Board
of Directors confirmed to Sandler O'Neill that following receipt of the revised indication of interest, Sandler O'Neill would be engaged to contact a limited number of other
financial institutions to perform a market check in order to ensure that Company A's price range was the best price reasonably available. A formal engagement letter was
executed by Sandler O'Neill and Coastway Bancorp on January 25, 2018.

        On December 27, 2018, a representative of Sandler O'Neill contacted HarborOne Bancorp's Chief Executive Officer, James Blake, to advise him that HarborOne Bancorp

opportunity to participate in a competitive process to acquire Coastway Bancorp sometime the week of January 1, 2018. No other details were provided by Sandler O'Neill at that
time.

        On January 2, 2018, Company A submitted a revised written non-binding indication of interest, dated as of January 3, 2018, in which it proposed to acquire 100% of the
common stock of Coastway Bancorp in an all-cash transaction. Pursuant to the letter of interest, each Coastway Bancorp stockholder would receive a fixed amount of cash for
each share of common stock that they owned with a range between $25.00 and $26.50 per share. Additionally, Company A proposed to appoint three Coastway Bancorp directors
to the Board of Directors of the resulting institution. The proposal was subject to the completion of a satisfactory due diligence examination of Coastway Bancorp. Company A
requested that Coastway Bancorp respond to its proposal by January 13, 2018.

        On January 2, 2018, Mr. White instructed representatives of Sandler O'Neill to begin contacting a limited number of other financial institutions to perform a market check to
gauge the competitiveness of Company A's offer as previously requested by the Board.

        Beginning on January 2, 2018, representatives of Sandler O'Neill contacted five institutions, including Company B, Company C and HarborOne Bancorp, as well as
Company D and Company E, each of which is a larger New England regional bank holding company. The institutions were chosen based on their perceived capacity to provide
financial terms at least as favorable as those being offered by Company A. In addition, each of the institutions had either previously expressed interest in pursuing a transaction
with Coastway Bancorp, or is located in or near Coastway Bancorp's market area. Representatives of Sandler O'Neill indicated to each institution contacted that Coastway
Bancorp had received a compelling proposal to enter into a merger transaction and was performing a market check. Sandler O'Neill did not specify the price range proposed by
Company A, but stated that Coastway Bancorp expected pricing to be above the average pricing metrics of recent comparable bank transactions. Representatives of Sandler
O'Neill requested that each institution provide its response or proposal by January 11, 2018 at the latest.

        On January 2, 2018, Company D indicated to Sandler O'Neill that it would decline to submit a proposal.

        On January 3, 2018, Company E responded to Sandler O'Neill that it would decline to submit a proposal.

        On January 5, 2018, the Board of Directors of Coastway Bancorp held a telephonic special meeting. Mr. White updated the Board on Company A's revised written non-
binding indication of interest, dated as of January 3, 2018. Mr. White advised the Board that he authorized Sandler O'Neill to begin contacting a limited number of other financial
institutions to perform a market check to gauge the competitiveness of Company A's offer as previously discussed. The Board agreed to reconvene on January 11, 2018 in order
for Sandler O'Neill to report to the Board the results of the market check.

        On January 10, 2018, Company C indicated to Sandler O'Neill that it had analyzed a potential merger transaction with Coastway Bancorp and would decline to submit a
proposal.

        On January 10, 2018, HarborOne Bancorp submitted a written non-binding indication of interest to Sandler O'Neill, in which it proposed to acquire 100% of the common
stock of Coastway Bancorp in an all-cash transaction. Pursuant to its indication of interest, HarborOne Bancorp proposed to pay a purchase price of between $27.50 and $29.00
per share for Coastway Bancorp common stock. HarborOne Bancorp noted in its letter that, based on the price-to-tangible book value multiple, the proposed price represented a
compelling opportunity to maximize stockholder value for Coastway Bancorp stockholders. HarborOne Bancorp requested that Coastway Bancorp respond by January 31, 2018
and noted that the proposal was subject to the completion of a satisfactory due diligence examination of Coastway Bancorp.

        On January 10, 2018, Company B submitted a written non-binding indication of interest to Sandler O'Neill, dated January 11, 2018. Company B proposed to acquire 100%
of the common stock of Coastway Bancorp at a purchase price of $25.50 per share. Pursuant to the indication of interest, Company B proposed that the merger consideration
would consist of 50% cash and 50% Company B common stock. Company B requested that Coastway Bancorp respond to its proposal by January 18, 2018. The offer was
subject to the completion of a satisfactory due diligence examination of Coastway Bancorp.

        On January 10, 2018, Mr. White requested to meet with Mr. Blake. Mr. White and Mr. Blake met on the morning of January 11, 2018. The purpose of the meeting was for
Mr. Blake to provide details about HarborOne Bancorp's operations, management team, corporate culture, growth strategy and business prospects, as Coastway Bancorp had not
previously met with representatives of HarborOne Bancorp. The parties discussed their respective franchises and philosophies, the merits of a potential transaction and the
opportunities for a combined institution.

        On January 11, 2018, the Board of Directors of Coastway Bancorp convened a special meeting. Representatives of Sandler O'Neill and Luse Gorman also participated in the
meeting. Mr. White first reported on his meeting with Mr. Blake and that the meeting had left him with a positive impression of HarborOne Bancorp's franchise.

        A representative from Sandler O'Neill then gave a presentation summarizing the transaction process to date. The Sandler O'Neill representative discussed the recent overall
market for financial institutions and presented a summary of financial and pricing information for comparable merger and acquisition transactions. The Sandler O'Neill
representative summarized the results of the process of contacting other financial institutions to gauge their interest in acquiring Coastway Bancorp and to solicit competitive
proposals. He summarized his conversations with each of the entities and the reasons that Company C, Company D and Company E declined to submit a proposal. He then
described in detail the financial aspects of the proposals made by each of Company A, Company B and HarborOne Bancorp. The Board first discussed the Company B proposal,
noting that the proposed purchase price of $25.50 (50% cash and 50% stock) and transaction multiples were significantly lower than both the ranges of Company A's and
HarborOne Bancorp's proposals. The Board also discussed the attributes of Company B's common stock. Following this discussion, the Board decided not to have Company B
continue in the process.

        The representative from Sandler O'Neill then presented pro forma ratio models reflecting a transaction between Coastway Bancorp and each of Company A and HarborOne
Bancorp, and compared the implied metrics of each potential transaction, highlighting various pricing metrics and the capital levels of the resulting institution. The Sandler
O'Neill representative noted the assumptions used to prepare the analysis and pricing metrics of each potential transaction and the financial information about the pro forma
company. He also outlined the typical timeline for a merger transaction.

        The Board then discussed the two remaining proposals, noting that Company A's proposal per share ranged from $25.00 to $26.50 which was significantly less than
HarborOne Bancorp's offer per share range of $27.50 to $29.00. The Board also noted that Company A had been negotiating with Coastway Bancorp for some time. As a result,
the Board authorized Sandler O'Neill to go back to Company A to offer them the opportunity to increase their current offer. Following the discussion of each proposal, the Board
of Directors directed representatives of Sandler O'Neill to invite both Company A and HarborOne Bancorp to do further due diligence and to finalize their proposals by providing
final pricing information.

        On January 12, 2018, representatives of Sandler O'Neill responded to HarborOne Bancorp and expressed Coastway Bancorp's interest in proceeding pursuant to HarborOne
Bancorp's January 10, 2018 non-binding indication of interest and invited HarborOne Bancorp to conduct due diligence.

HarborOne Bancorp accepted this invitation. Representatives of Sandler O'Neill requested that HarborOne Bancorp finalize its proposal by February 15, 2018.

        Also on January 12, 2018, representatives of Sandler O'Neill invited Company A to conduct further due diligence on Coastway Bancorp and consider whether it could
increase its pricing to remain competitive with the other interested bidders. The Chief Executive Officer of Company A noted that Company A might be willing to increase its
proposed purchase price but that it was unlikely to be within the price range guidance offered by Sandler O'Neill.

        After further discussions with Sandler O'Neill and Coastway Bancorp, on January 18, 2018, Company A declined to further increase its price range and determined not to
proceed any further in the process. However, Company A expressed continued interest in pursuing a merger with Coastway Bancorp, pursuant to the terms of its January 3, 2018
indication of interest, if Coastway Bancorp did not proceed with another party. Mr. White updated the Board of Directors of Coastway Bancorp of Company A's decision at a
special meeting held telephonically on January 18, 2018.

        On January 19, 2018, HarborOne Bancorp and Coastway Bancorp executed a nondisclosure agreement to permit the parties to proceed with their due diligence investigation
of each other. On January 22, 2018, HarborOne Bancorp sent Coastway Bancorp a list of the materials it wished to review as part of its due diligence review of Coastway
Bancorp. On January 23, 2018, a data room containing materials relating to Coastway Bancorp was established by Sandler O'Neill and Coastway Bancorp and was made
available to HarborOne Bancorp and its advisors.

        At the regularly scheduled January 25, 2018 meeting of the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors, Mr. White updated the Board of Directors on the progress of due
diligence and the proposed transaction with HarborOne Bancorp. The Board also established a Strategic Committee consisting of Directors Crevier (subsequently replaced by
DiSanto), Kydd and Lopresti, all of whom are independent directors under Nasdaq guidelines, to assist with reviewing a potential Merger Agreement and compensation
arrangements as proposed by HarborOne Bancorp and to make a recommendation to the full Board of Directors.

        On February 2, 2018, Mr. White and Jeanette Fritz, Coastway Bancorp's Chief Financial Officer, visited HarborOne Bancorp's offices for due diligence discussions with
Mr. Blake, Joseph Casey, HarborOne Bancorp's President and Chief Operating Officer, and Linda Simmons, HarborOne Bank's Chief Financial Officer. Representatives of
Sandler O'Neill and HarborOne Bancorp's investment advisor also attended the meeting. The parties discussed business matters, including Coastway Bancorp's financial
performance and expectations for the future, as well as employee matters.

        On February 13, 2018, Mr. White met with Mr. Blake. Mr. Blake reiterated HarborOne Bancorp's strong interest in Coastway Bancorp and his belief that a strategic
combination would benefit both companies and provide a compelling valuation for Coastway Bancorp stockholders.

        On February 15, 2018, HarborOne Bancorp submitted an updated written non-binding indication of interest, pursuant to which it proposed to pay a price of $28.25 per share
for Coastway Bancorp common stock. Other than the price per share, the material terms of the proposal were unchanged from the initial letter dated January 10, 2018. The
revised letter of interest contained a provision whereby, if the terms of the letter were accepted, Coastway Bancorp would agree to negotiate exclusively with HarborOne Bancorp
for a period of 45 days. HarborOne Bancorp requested a response to its proposal by February 22, 2018.

        At the regularly scheduled February 20, 2018 meeting of the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors, the Board of Directors reviewed and discussed HarborOne Bancorp's
proposal. Representatives of Sandler O'Neill and Luse Gorman also attended the meeting. Representatives of Luse Gorman reviewed a memorandum they had prepared, which
was previously distributed to the

Board, summarizing the directors' fiduciary duties, with an emphasis on the role of the Board of Directors in a change-in-control transaction.

        A Sandler O'Neill representative then reviewed a presentation, a copy of which had been previously distributed to the Board of Directors. The Sandler O'Neill representative
summarized the history of the sales process to date, beginning with Coastway Bancorp's discussions with Company A, and the market check that followed resulting in HarborOne
Bancorp's proposal, which was significantly greater than any other proposal received during the process. The Sandler O'Neill representative then reviewed HarborOne Bancorp's
proposal, including pricing metrics in comparison to recent comparable regional bank and thrift transactions, and provided information about the pro forma branch network and
composition of the loan and deposit portfolios of Coastway Bancorp and HarborOne Bancorp on a combined basis. Sandler O'Neill detailed that the transaction would be valued
at approximately 174% of price-to-tangible book value, which exceeded the means and medians of recent comparable regional bank and thrift transactions. Sandler O'Neill also
noted that HarborOne Bancorp desired to retain several of the Coastway Bancorp executives, including Mr. White, to maintain the continuity of the business as they would be a
new entrant in the market. The Sandler O'Neill representative responded to questions from the Board of Directors about his presentation and the value of Coastway Bancorp's
franchise.

        Following its discussion, the Board of Directors unanimously voted to authorize Mr. White to proceed to execute the letter of interest with HarborOne Bancorp and to enter
into the proposed 45-day exclusivity agreement. Mr. White countersigned the letter of interest on February 21, 2018.

        On February 27, 2018, HarborOne Bancorp's legal counsel, Goodwin Procter LLP ("Goodwin Procter"), provided Luse Gorman with an initial draft of the Merger
Agreement.

        On March 2, 2018, Mr. White and other Coastway Bancorp senior executives and representatives of Sandler O'Neill met at a hotel conference room in Warwick, Rhode
Island with HarborOne Bancorp senior executives and their advisors in order to participate in management interviews as part of each party's due diligence investigation of the
other party.

        On March 5, 2018, Luse Gorman sent Coastway Bancorp's proposed revisions to the Merger Agreement to Goodwin Procter. The revisions focused on, among other items,
eliminating certain expenses payable upon termination of the Merger Agreement, the representations, warranties and covenants of Coastway Bancorp, and employee matters.

        On March 7, 2018, representatives of Luse Gorman conducted legal and regulatory due diligence interviews of HarborOne Bancorp management to determine, among other
things, if there were any issues concerning HarborOne Bancorp that would affect HarborOne Bancorp's ability to secure regulatory approval for the transaction.

        On March 8, 2018, Mr. White and a director of Coastway Bancorp met with representatives of Luse Gorman at Luse Gorman's offices to discuss the status of the Merger
Agreement. Subsequently, on March 8, 2018, Mr. White provided an update on the status of the Merger Agreement to the members of the Strategic Committee of the Coastway
Bancorp Board of Directors and circulated a copy of the most recent draft of the Merger Agreement to the committee members.

        On March 8, 2018, Luse Gorman had a call with Goodwin Procter to negotiate the terms of the Merger Agreement. The negotiations focused on, among other items, the
representations, warranties and covenants of Coastway Bancorp, and employee matters. Over the next several days, Luse Gorman and Goodwin Procter finalized the Merger
Agreement for circulation to the Boards of Directors of Coastway Bancorp and HarborOne Bancorp.

        At meetings held on March 9 and 10, 2018, the Strategic Committee met with Mr. White and representatives of Luse Gorman to review the Merger Agreement and to

negotiations relating to the merger and offers of employment to certain senior executives, including Mr. White. On March 10, 2018, the Strategic Committee voted unanimously
to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement to the full Board.

        On March 12, 2018, Coastway Bancorp convened a special meeting of its Board of Directors to review the Merger Agreement and the proposed merger with HarborOne
Bancorp. Representatives of Sandler O'Neill and Luse Gorman also attended the meeting.

        Representatives of Luse Gorman summarized the results of Coastway Bancorp's due diligence investigation of HarborOne Bancorp. The representatives of Luse Gorman
then reviewed in detail the terms of each section of the Merger Agreement and the voting agreement and answered questions relating to the Merger Agreement and related
documents and disclosure schedules.

        A representative of Sandler O'Neill summarized the historical financial performance of HarborOne Bancorp and provided a financial overview of the proposed merger. The
Sandler O'Neill representative discussed the pro forma branch footprint and the pro forma capital position of the combined company. The Sandler O'Neill representative also
highlighted pricing measures for the proposed transaction and compared them to merger transactions involving comparably sized financial institutions in the Northeast region that
had been completed since January 1, 2015. Sandler O'Neill noted that the pricing terms generally exceeded the averages and medians for price-to-tangible book value and the
core deposit premiums as compared to the lists of comparable transactions. The Sandler O'Neill representative also discussed merger-related costs and answered questions from
the Board of Directors.

        The Sandler O'Neill representative then delivered Sandler O'Neill's oral opinion that, as of March 12, 2018, and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken, as set forth in the opinion, the merger consideration to be paid to Coastway Bancorp common stockholders was fair
from a financial point of view. He confirmed that Sandler O'Neill's written opinion, dated March 12, 2018, would be delivered to the Board of Directors following the meeting.

        Following the presentations of and discussions with the financial and legal advisors, the Board of Directors of Coastway Bancorp reviewed and discussed the proposed
Merger Agreement and merger.

        Due to severe weather in the Rhode Island area, the Board of Directors reconvened on March 14, 2018 to take action upon the final Merger Agreement. Management and
representatives of Luse Gorman and Sandler O'Neill confirmed that there had been no changes to the proposed merger consideration or any material changes to the terms of the
transaction or the provisions of the Merger Agreement since the previous Board meeting held on March 12, 2018. The Sandler O'Neill representative confirmed that there had
been no material changes in the market or the financial institution indices referenced in its March 12, 2018 fairness opinion.

        Following consideration of this information, including those factors described under "—Coastway Bancorp's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Board of
Directors that Coastway Bancorp Stockholders Vote "FOR" Approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger," the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors determined that the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were advisable and in the best interest of Coastway Bancorp and its stockholders. The directors then unanimously
voted to adopt the Merger Agreement (with and without Mr. White voting) and recommend that Coastway Bancorp stockholders vote to approve the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby.

        Following the completion of the Coastway Bancorp and HarborOne Bancorp Board meetings, the Merger Agreement was executed and delivered. Following the close of the
market on March 14, 2018, HarborOne Bancorp and Coastway Bancorp issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement.

Coastway Bancorp's Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Board of Directors that Coastway Bancorp Stockholders Vote "FOR" Approval of the
Merger Agreement and the Merger 

        The Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors reviewed and discussed the proposed merger with management and Coastway Bancorp's financial and legal advisors in
unanimously determining that the proposed merger is in the best interests of Coastway Bancorp and its stockholders. In reaching its determination to approve the Merger
Agreement, the Board of Directors considered a number of factors affecting the business, operations, financial condition, earnings and future prospects of Coastway Bancorp.
The material factors considered by the Board of Directors included:

• The business strategy and strategic plan of Coastway Bancorp, its prospects for the future, its projected financial results, and management's assessment of the
execution risks involved in attaining the performance levels assumed by its forecasts; 

• A review of the risks and prospects of Coastway Bancorp remaining independent, including the challenges of the current financial, operating and regulatory
environment; the increasing costs associated with banking regulation, compliance and technology; and the anticipated costs with continuing to develop and
enhance Coastway Bancorp's business capabilities and increasing Coastway Bancorp's capital position; 

• Conditions and activity in the mergers and acquisition market, which provided a window of opportunity with respect to a merger of Coastway Bancorp for
delivery of accelerated and enhanced stockholder value, as compared to organic growth and execution of Coastway Bancorp's business plan as an independent
institution; 

• The per share merger consideration to be paid by HarborOne Bancorp, which represents 174% of Coastway Bancorp's book value and 44.0x Coastway Bancorp's
trailing twelve-month earnings; 

• The form of the merger consideration, including the reduced volatility provided by cash consideration; 

• The results of the solicitation process conducted by Coastway Bancorp, with the advice and assistance of its financial and legal advisors, and the purchase price
per share proposed by alternative merger partners; 

• The financial presentation, dated March 12, 2018, of Sandler O'Neill to the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors and the opinion, dated March 12, 2018, of
Sandler O'Neill to the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, to the holders of
Coastway Bancorp common stock of the merger consideration in the merger, as more fully described below under "—Opinion of Coastway Bancorp's Financial
Advisor"; 

• The likelihood of obtaining the stockholder and regulatory approvals needed to complete the transaction and the ability of HarborOne Bancorp to complete the
merger from a business, financial and regulatory perspective; 

• HarborOne Bancorp's historically strong financial condition and results of operations; 

• A review of the historical financial statements and condition of Coastway Bancorp and certain other internal information, primarily financial in nature, relating to
the business, earnings and financial condition of Coastway Bancorp;

• Certain structural protections included in the Merger Agreement, including: 

• the fact that the Merger Agreement does not preclude a third party from making an unsolicited acquisition proposal to Coastway Bancorp and that, under
certain circumstances more fully described under "—Covenants and Agreements—Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers," Coastway Bancorp may
furnish non-public information to and enter into discussions with such a third party regarding a qualifying acquisition proposal; 

• the ability of Coastway Bancorp to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement for a superior proposal if certain requirements are
met, in each case subject to the payment of a termination fee by Coastway Bancorp of $5.025 million, an amount that was negotiated at arm's-length and
was determined by the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors, in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, to be reasonable; and 

• the HarborOne Bancorp's covenant to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required regulatory approvals for the merger.

described under the heading "—Financial Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger";

• The potential costs associated with executing the Merger Agreement, including change in control payments and related costs, as well as estimated advisor fees;
and 

• The possibility of litigation in connection with the merger.

        The Board of Directors evaluated the factors described above and reached a unanimous determination that the merger was in the best interests of Coastway Bancorp and its
stockholders. In reaching its determination to approve and recommend the transaction, Coastway Bancorp's Board of Directors looked at the totality of the information presented
to it and did not assign any relative or specific weights to any of the individual factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors.
The Board of Directors considered these factors as a whole, including the potential risks, uncertainties and disadvantages associated with the merger, and overall considered the
benefits of the merger to be favorable and outweigh the potential risks, uncertainties and disadvantages of the merger. It should be noted that this explanation of the Board of
Directors' reasoning and certain other information presented in this section are forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under
"Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information."

        The Board of Directors unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and in the best interests of Coastway
Bancorp and its stockholders. The Board of Directors also unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are consistent with, and
in furtherance of, Coastway Bancorp's business strategies. Accordingly, the Board of Directors unanimously approved and adopted the Merger Agreement and the merger
and unanimously recommends that Coastway Bancorp stockholders vote "FOR" approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger.

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board of Directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but constitutes the material factors
considered by the Board. In reaching its unanimous determination to approve and recommend the Merger Agreement, the Board did not assign any relative or specific
weights to the foregoing factors, and individual directors may have weighed factors differently. The terms of the Merger Agreement were the product of arm's-length
negotiations between representatives of Coastway Bancorp and HarborOne Bancorp.

        Coastway Bancorp retained Sandler O'Neill to act as an independent financial advisor to Coastway Bancorp's Board of Directors in connection with Coastway Bancorp's
consideration of a possible business combination. Sandler O'Neill is a nationally recognized investment banking firm whose principal business specialty is financial institutions.
In the ordinary course of its investment banking business, Sandler O'Neill is regularly engaged in the valuation of financial institutions and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions.

        Sandler O'Neill acted as an independent financial advisor to Coastway Bancorp in connection with the proposed transaction and participated in certain of the negotiations
leading to the execution of the Merger Agreement. At the March 12, 2018 meeting of Coastway Bancorp's Board of Directors, at which the Board of Directors considered and
discussed the terms of the Merger Agreement and the merger, Sandler O'Neill delivered to Coastway Bancorp's Board of Directors its oral opinion, which was subsequently
confirmed in writing on March 12, 2018, to the effect that, as of such date, the merger consideration was fair to the holders of Coastway Bancorp common stock from a financial
point of view. The full text of Sandler O'Neill's opinion is attached as Appendix B to this proxy statement. The opinion outlines the procedures followed, assumptions
made, matters considered and

qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Sandler O'Neill in rendering its opinion. The description of the opinion set forth below is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. Holders of Coastway Bancorp common stock are urged to read the entire opinion carefully in connection with their
consideration of the proposed merger.

        Sandler O'Neill's opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. Sandler O'Neill's opinion is directed to the Board of Directors of Coastway Bancorp in
connection with its consideration of the Merger Agreement and the merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of Coastway Bancorp as to
how any such stockholder should vote at any meeting of stockholders called to consider and vote upon the approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger. Sandler
O'Neill's opinion is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to the holders of Coastway Bancorp common stock and
does not address the underlying business decision of Coastway Bancorp to engage in the merger, the form or structure of the merger or any other transactions
contemplated in the Merger Agreement, the relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative transactions or business strategies that might exist for
Coastway Bancorp or the effect of any other transaction in which Coastway Bancorp might engage. Sandler O'Neill also did not express any opinion as to the fairness of
the amount or nature of the compensation to be received in the merger by any officer, director or employee of Coastway Bancorp or HarborOne Bancorp or any class of such
persons, if any, relative to the compensation to be received in the merger by any other stockholder. Sandler O'Neill's opinion was approved by Sandler O'Neill's fairness opinion
committee.

        In connection with its opinion, Sandler O'Neill reviewed and considered, among other things:

• a draft of the Merger Agreement, dated March 9, 2018; 

• certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of Coastway Bancorp that Sandler O'Neill deemed relevant; 

• certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of HarborOne Bancorp that Sandler O'Neill deemed relevant; 

• internal financial projections for Coastway Bancorp for the years ending December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2021, as provided by the senior management
of Coastway Bancorp; 

• the pro forma financial impact of the merger on HarborOne Bancorp's capital ratios given certain assumptions relating to estimated transaction expenses and
purchase accounting adjustments, as provided by the senior management of HarborOne Bancorp; 

• a comparison of certain financial information for Coastway Bancorp with similar institutions for which information is publicly available; 

• the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the bank and thrift industry (on a regional and nationwide basis), to the extent publicly available; 

• the current market environment generally and the banking environment in particular; and 

• such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria as Sandler O'Neill considered relevant.

        Sandler O'Neill also discussed with certain members of the senior management of Coastway Bancorp the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of
Coastway Bancorp and held similar discussions with certain members of the senior management of HarborOne Bancorp and its representatives regarding the business, financial
condition, results of operations and prospects of HarborOne Bancorp.

        In performing its review, Sandler O'Neill relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information that was available to and reviewed by
Sandler O'Neill from public

sources, that was provided to Sandler O'Neill by Coastway Bancorp or HarborOne Bancorp or their respective representatives or that was otherwise reviewed by Sandler O'Neill
and Sandler O'Neill assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering its opinion without any independent verification or investigation. Sandler O'Neill relied
on the assurances of the respective managements of Coastway Bancorp and HarborOne Bancorp that they were not aware of any facts or circumstances that would have made
any of such information inaccurate or misleading. Sandler O'Neill was not asked to and did not undertake an independent verification of any of such information and Sandler
O'Neill did not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof. Sandler O'Neill did not make an independent evaluation or perform an appraisal of
the specific assets, the collateral securing assets or the liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Coastway Bancorp or HarborOne Bancorp or any of their respective subsidiaries,
nor was Sandler O'Neill furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. Sandler O'Neill rendered no opinion or evaluation on the collectability of any assets or the future
performance of any loans of Coastway Bancorp or HarborOne Bancorp or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries. Sandler O'Neill did not make an independent
evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses of Coastway Bancorp or HarborOne Bancorp, or the combined entity after the merger and did not review any
individual credit files relating to Coastway Bancorp or HarborOne Bancorp. Sandler O'Neill assumed, with Coastway Bancorp's consent, that the respective allowances for loan
losses for Coastway Bancorp, HarborOne Bancorp and their respective affiliates or subsidiaries were adequate to cover such losses and would be adequate on a pro forma basis
for the combined entity.

        In preparing its analyses, Sandler O'Neill used internal financial projections for Coastway Bancorp for the years ending December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2021, as
provided by the senior management of Coastway Bancorp. Sandler O'Neill also received and used in its pro forma analyses certain assumptions relating to estimated transaction
expenses and purchase accounting adjustments, as provided by the senior management of HarborOne Bancorp. With respect to the foregoing information, the respective senior
managements of Coastway Bancorp and HarborOne Bancorp confirmed to Sandler O'Neill that such information reflected the best currently available projections and estimates
of those respective senior managements of the future financial performance of Coastway Bancorp and HarborOne Bancorp, respectively, and Sandler O'Neill assumed that such
performance would be achieved. Sandler O'Neill expressed no opinion as to such information, or the assumptions on which they were based. Sandler O'Neill also assumed that
there had been no material change in Coastway Bancorp's or HarborOne Bancorp's, or any of their respective affiliates' or subsidiaries', assets, financial condition, results of
operations, business or prospects since the date of the most recent financial statements made available to Sandler O'Neill. Sandler O'Neill assumed in all respects material to its
analysis that Coastway Bancorp and HarborOne Bancorp would remain as going concerns for all periods relevant to its analyses.

        Sandler O'Neill also assumed, with Coastway Bancorp's consent, that (i) each of the parties to the Merger Agreement will comply in all material respects with all material
terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and all related agreements, that all of the representations and warranties contained in such agreements are true and correct in all
material respects, that each of the parties to such agreements will perform in all material respects all of the covenants and other obligations required to be performed by such
party under such agreements and that the conditions precedent in such agreements are not and will not be waived, (ii) in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third
party approvals, consents and releases with respect to the merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Coastway
Bancorp, HarborOne Bancorp or the merger or any related transaction, and (iii) the merger and any related transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement without any waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof and in compliance with all applicable laws and other
requirements. Finally, with Coastway Bancorp's consent, Sandler O'Neill has relied upon the advice that Coastway Bancorp has received from its legal, accounting and

tax advisors as to all legal, accounting and tax matters relating to the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Sandler O'Neill expresses no
opinion as to any such matters.

        Sandler O'Neill's opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Sandler O'Neill as
of, the date thereof. Events occurring after the date thereof could materially affect Sandler O'Neill's opinion. Sandler O'Neill has not undertaken to update, revise, reaffirm or
withdraw its opinion or otherwise comment upon events occurring after the date thereof.

        In rendering its opinion, Sandler O'Neill performed a variety of financial analyses. The summary below is not a complete description of all the analyses underlying Sandler
O'Neill's opinion or the presentation made by Sandler O'Neill to Coastway Bancorp's Board of Directors, but is a summary of the material analyses performed and presented by
Sandler O'Neill. The summary includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, these tables must be read together with
the accompanying text. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process
involving subjective judgments as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. The
process, therefore, is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. Sandler O'Neill believes that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of the factors and analyses to be considered without considering all factors and analyses, or attempting to ascribe relative weights to some or all such factors
and analyses, could create an incomplete view of the evaluation process underlying its opinion. Also, no company included in Sandler O'Neill's comparative analyses described
below is identical to Coastway Bancorp or HarborOne Bancorp and no transaction is identical to the merger. Accordingly, an analysis of comparable companies or transactions
involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the companies and other factors that could affect the public
trading values or merger transaction values, as the case may be, of Coastway Bancorp and HarborOne Bancorp and the companies to which they were compared. In arriving at its
opinion, Sandler O'Neill did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered. Rather, Sandler O'Neill made qualitative judgments as to the
significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Sandler O'Neill did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor (positive or negative) considered in
isolation supported or failed to support its opinion, rather, Sandler O'Neill made its determination as to the fairness of the merger consideration on the basis of its experience and
professional judgment after considering the results of all its analyses taken as a whole.

        In performing its analyses, Sandler O'Neill also made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, business and economic conditions and various other
matters, many of which cannot be predicted and are beyond the control of Coastway Bancorp, HarborOne Bancorp and Sandler O'Neill. The analyses performed by Sandler
O'Neill are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, both of which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Sandler
O'Neill prepared its analyses solely for purposes of rendering its opinion and provided such analyses to Coastway Bancorp's Board of Directors at its March 12, 2018 meeting.
Estimates on the values of companies do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or their securities may actually be sold. Such estimates
are inherently subject to uncertainty and actual values may be materially different. Accordingly, Sandler O'Neill's analyses do not necessarily reflect the value of Coastway
Bancorp's common stock or the price at which Coastway Bancorp common stock may be sold at any time. The analyses of Sandler O'Neill and its opinion were among a number
of factors taken into consideration by Coastway Bancorp's Board of Directors in making its determination to approve the Merger Agreement and the analyses described below
should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of Coastway Bancorp's Board of Directors or management with respect to the fairness of the merger.

        Summary of Proposed Merger Consideration and Implied Transaction Metrics.    Sandler O'Neill reviewed the financial terms of the proposed merger. Pursuant to the
terms of the Merger Agreement, upon the effective time of the merger, each share of Coastway Bancorp common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger, except for certain shares as set forth in the Merger Agreement, shall be converted into the right to receive, without interest, cash in the amount of $28.25 per
share. Sandler O'Neill calculated an aggregate implied transaction value of approximately $125.6 million, assuming 110,338 Coastway Bancorp options outstanding with a
weighted average exercise price of $13.29 per share as of December 31, 2017, and 4,386,351 shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock outstanding. Based upon financial
information for Coastway Bancorp as or for the twelve months ("LTM") ended December 31, 2017, Sandler O'Neill calculated the following implied transaction metrics:

        Comparable Company Analyses.    Sandler O'Neill used publicly available information to compare selected financial information for Coastway Bancorp with a group of
financial institutions selected by Sandler O'Neill. The Coastway Bancorp peer group consisted of twelve banks and thrifts headquartered in the Northeast region whose securities
are publicly traded with assets between $400 million and $1.0 billion, excluding targets of announced merger transactions (the "Coastway Bancorp Peer Group"). The Coastway
Bancorp Peer Group also excluded mutual holding companies and Darien Rowayton Bank due to their undisclosed amount of shares outstanding. The Coastway Bancorp Peer
Group consisted of the following companies:

        The analysis compared publicly available financial information for Coastway Bancorp with the corresponding data for the Coastway Bancorp Peer Group as of or for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2017 with pricing data as of March 9, 2018. The table below sets forth the data for Coastway Bancorp and the median, mean, low and high

Transactions group.

        Stock Trading History.    Sandler O'Neill reviewed the history of the publicly reported trading price of Coastway Bancorp common stock for the three-year period ended
March 9, 2018. Sandler O'Neill then compared the relationship between the movements in the price of Coastway Bancorp common stock to the Coastway Bancorp Peer Group as
well as certain stock indices.

        Net Present Value Analyses.    Sandler O'Neill performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per share of Coastway Bancorp common stock assuming Coastway
Bancorp performed in accordance with internal financial projections for Coastway Bancorp for the years ending December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2021, as provided by
the senior management of Coastway Bancorp. To approximate the terminal value of Coastway Bancorp common stock at December 31, 2021, Sandler O'Neill applied price to
2021 earnings multiples ranging from 10.0x to 18.0x and multiples of December 31, 2021 tangible book value ranging from 100% to 160%. The terminal values were then
discounted to present values using different discount rates ranging from 11.5% to 15.5%, which were chosen to reflect different assumptions regarding required rates of return of
holders or prospective buyers of Coastway Bancorp common stock. As illustrated in the following tables, the analyses indicated an imputed range of values per share of
Coastway Bancorp common stock of $12.63 to $26.17 when applying multiples of earnings and $14.21 to $26.17 when applying multiples of tangible book value.

        Sandler O'Neill also considered and discussed with the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors how this analysis would be affected by changes in the underlying assumptions,
including variations with respect to net income. To illustrate this impact, Sandler O'Neill performed a similar analysis assuming Coastway Bancorp's net income varied from 15%
above projections to 15% below projections. This analysis resulted in the following range of per share values for Coastway Bancorp common stock, applying the price to 2021
earnings multiples range of 10.0x to 18.0x referred to above and a discount rate of 13.52%.

        Pro Forma Results and Capital Ratios.    Sandler O'Neill analyzed certain potential pro forma effects of the merger on HarborOne Bancorp's capital ratios given certain
assumptions relating to estimated transaction expenses and purchase accounting adjustments, as provided by the senior management of HarborOne Bancorp. The analyses
indicated that as of December 31, 2018, the merger would maintain HarborOne Bancorp's and its bank subsidiary's regulatory capital ratios in excess of the regulatory guidelines
for "well-capitalized" status. In connection with its pro forma analyses, Sandler O'Neill considered and discussed with the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors how the results
thereof are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results. The actual results achieved by the combined company may vary from projected results and the variations
may be material.

        Sandler O'Neill's Relationships.    Sandler O'Neill is acting as financial advisor to Coastway Bancorp in connection with the merger. Coastway Bancorp has agreed to pay
Sandler O'Neill a transaction fee in an amount equal to 1.30% of the aggregate merger consideration, which fee at the time of announcement was approximately $1.6 million and
is contingent upon the closing of the merger. Sandler O'Neill also received a fee in an amount equal to $100,000 upon Sandler O'Neill rendering its fairness opinion, which
opinion fee will be credited in full towards the transaction fee which will become payable to Sandler O'Neill upon the closing of the merger. Coastway Bancorp has also agreed

to indemnify Sandler O'Neill against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement and to reimburse Sandler O'Neill for certain of its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the engagement.

        Sandler O'Neill did not provide any other investment banking services to Coastway Bancorp in the two years preceding the date of its opinion. Sandler O'Neill advised the
Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors that Sandler O'Neill provided investment banking services to, and received fees from HarborOne Bancorp in the two years preceding the
date of its opinion. In 2016, in connection with HarborOne Bancorp's reorganization into a two-tier mutual holding company structure, Sandler O'Neill was retained by
HarborOne Bancorp to manage the subscription offering and community offering and to also perform records management services in connection therewith. In addition, in the
ordinary course of Sandler O'Neill's business as a broker-dealer, Sandler O'Neill may purchase securities from and sell securities to Coastway Bancorp, HarborOne Bancorp and
their respective affiliates. Sandler O'Neill may also actively trade the equity and debt securities of Coastway Bancorp, HarborOne Bancorp and their respective affiliates for
Sandler O'Neill's own account and for the accounts of Sandler O'Neill's customers.

Certain Prospective Financial Information Provided by Coastway Bancorp 

        Coastway Bancorp does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or internal projections as to its future performance, earnings or other results due to, among
other things, the inherent uncertainty of certain underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Coastway Bancorp provided Sandler O'Neill with its internal financial forecast
regarding certain nonpublic unaudited prospective financial information regarding Coastway Bancorp prepared by management. A summary of these projections is included in
this proxy statement because such initial forecasts were made available to Sandler O'Neill, as part of its fairness opinion analysis.

        The financial forecast was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or compliance with published guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for Prospective Financial Information, or generally accepted accounting principle. The
prospective financial information included in this proxy statement was prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Coastway Bancorp's management. Coastway Bancorp's
independent auditor, Crowe Horwath LLP, did not examine, compile or perform any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information and, accordingly, such firm
does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.

        The financial forecast is a forward-looking statement that is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such estimate and
should be read with caution. Although presented with numerical specificity, this estimate is based upon a variety of assumptions made by Coastway Bancorp's management with
respect to, among other things, industry performance, general economic, market, interest rate, and financial conditions, the timing and level of new loan originations and deposit
generation, operating and other revenues and expenses, effective tax rates, capital expenditures, working capital and other matters. Some or all of the assumptions may not be
realized, and as historical performance suggests, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are
difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Coastway Bancorp. In addition, some of these assumptions, by their nature, are subjective in many respects.

        The inclusion in this proxy statement of the nonpublic unaudited prospective financial information below should not be regarded as an indication that Coastway Bancorp, its
Board of Directors, or Sandler O'Neill considered, or now consider, these projections and forecasts to be fact or necessarily predictive of actual future results and should not be
relied upon as such. The unaudited prospective financial information does not give effect to the merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the merger agreement,
the expenses to be incurred in connection with consummating the

merger, the potential synergies that may be achieved by the combined company as a result of the merger, the effect on either Coastway Bancorp or HarborOne Bancorp, as
applicable, of any business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed, or the effect of any business or
strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed, but that were instead altered, accelerated, postponed, or not taken
in anticipation of the merger. In addition, the financial forecasts may not reflect the manner in which HarborOne Bancorp would operate Coastway Bancorp's business after the
merger.

        For these reasons, the financial forecast in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that it is necessarily predictive of actual future performance and it
should not be relied on as such. No one has made, or makes, any representation regarding this estimate by its inclusion in this proxy statement and, except as may be required by
applicable securities laws, Coastway Bancorp does not intend to update or otherwise revise the projection to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect
the occurrence of future events even if any or all of the assumptions underlying the projection are shown to be in error.

        Below are certain financial projections that were prepared by Coastway Bancorp's management and provided to Sandler O'Neill in connection with the proposed merger.

Surrender of Shares; Payment of Merger Consideration 

        On or before the closing date of the merger, HarborOne Bancorp will deposit with the exchange agent for the merger (the "Exchange Agent"), an amount of cash sufficient
to pay the merger consideration to Coastway Bancorp stockholders. The Exchange Agent will facilitate the payment of the merger consideration to the record holders of
Coastway Bancorp common stock in exchange for their shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock.

        Within five business days after the effective time of the merger, the Exchange Agent will mail to each holder of record of Coastway Bancorp common stock a letter of
transmittal with instructions on how to surrender your shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock in exchange for the merger consideration. If you hold your shares in book
entry form, you will only need to complete the letter of transmittal and return it to the Exchange Agent in order to receive the merger consideration. If you hold certificates for
your shares, you will need to complete the letter of transmittal and include your certificates and return both to the Exchange Agent in order to receive the merger consideration. If
your shares of common stock are held in "street name" by your bank, broker or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee as to what
action, if any, you need to take to receive the merger consideration. Please do not send in your Coastway Bancorp stock

certificates if any until you receive the letter of transmittal and instructions from the Exchange Agent. Do not return your stock certificates with the enclosed proxy
card.

        After you mail the letter of transmittal (with any applicable stock certificates), you will receive the merger consideration that you are entitled to receive, after giving effect to
any required tax withholdings. The shares you surrender will be canceled. You will not be entitled to receive interest on any portion of the merger consideration.

        Any portion of the merger consideration that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Coastway Bancorp for more than 12 months after the effective time of the merger
will be repaid to HarborOne Bancorp. If you have not complied with the exchange procedures described above within 12 months after the effective time of the merger, you may
only look to HarborOne Bancorp for payment of the merger consideration you are entitled to receive in exchange for your shares of common stock, without any interest, and
subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws.

        If your Coastway Bancorp stock certificates have has been lost, stolen or destroyed, you will be required to sign an affidavit before you receive any consideration for your
shares. The Exchange Agent will send you instructions on how to complete such an affidavit. You may be required to post a bond in a reasonable amount as HarborOne Bancorp
or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim related to your common stock.

        HarborOne Bancorp or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the merger consideration otherwise payable to any Coastway Bancorp stockholder
the amounts HarborOne Bancorp or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, are required to deduct and withhold under any applicable federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If
HarborOne Bancorp or the Exchange Agent withholds any amounts, these amounts will be treated as having been paid to the stockholders from whom they were withheld.

Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders 

        The following is a discussion of certain federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined below) of Coastway Bancorp common stock whose
shares are converted into the right to receive $28.25 in cash per share at closing. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Internal Revenue Code"), applicable current and proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations, judicial authority, and administrative rulings and practice, all of which are subject to
change, possibly on a retroactive basis. Any such change could alter the tax consequences described herein.

        For purposes of this discussion, we use the term "U.S. holder" to mean a beneficial owner of shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock that is:

• an individual citizen or resident of the United States; 

• a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organized under the laws of the United States or any state thereof (or the District of Columbia); 

• a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust, or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or 

• an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.

        This discussion assumes that the Coastway Bancorp common stock is held for investment purposes. This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S federal income tax
that may be relevant to a Coastway Bancorp stockholder in light of its particular circumstances, or that may apply to a Coastway

Bancorp stockholder that is subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (including but not limited to foreign persons (generally, a person that is not a
citizen or resident of the United States, a U.S. domestic corporation, or a person that would otherwise be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis with respect to
their Coastway Bancorp common stock), financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, dealers in securities or foreign currencies, entities that are treated for federal income tax
purposes as partnerships or other pass-through entities, insurance companies or employees who acquired the stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or other
compensation arrangements). This discussion is for general information only and is not tax advice. The U.S. federal income tax consequences described below are not
intended to constitute a complete description of all tax consequences relating to the merger. Coastway Bancorp stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to
determine the tax consequences to them of, including the application and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income, estate, gift and other tax laws to, the
receipt of the cash consideration in exchange for Coastway Bancorp common stock pursuant to the merger.

        The receipt of the merger consideration by a U.S. holder in exchange for shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes (and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local and foreign income or other tax laws). For U.S. federal income tax purposes,
a U.S. holder of Coastway Bancorp common stock generally will recognize capital gain or loss at the effective time of the merger equal to the difference, if any, between:

• $28.25 in cash received by the U.S. holder in exchange for such Coastway Bancorp common stock; and 

• the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in such Coastway Bancorp common stock.

        Such gain or loss generally will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder's holding period for the Coastway Bancorp common stock surrendered in the merger
exceeds one year as of the date of the merger. In general, long-term capital gain of individuals currently is subject to U.S. federal income tax at a maximum rate of 20%. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. The amount and character of gain or loss must be determined separately for each block of
Coastway Bancorp common stock (i.e., shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) exchanged for the merger consideration in the merger.

        Under the Internal Revenue Code, the merger consideration received in the merger by a U.S. holder may be subject to U.S. information reporting and backup withholding.
Backup withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) will apply with respect to the amount of cash received by a non-corporate U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder provides proof of
an applicable exemption or a correct taxpayer identification number on an IRS Form W-9 (enclosed with the letter of transmittal sent by the Exchange Agent), and otherwise
complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules may be refunded or credited against a U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such U.S. holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a
timely manner.

        The foregoing discussion does not claim to be a complete discussion of the potential tax consequences of the merger. Coastway Bancorp stockholders should
consult their tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the merger, including the applicability and effect of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income,
estate, gift and other tax laws in their particular circumstances. Nothing in this discussion is intended to be, or should be construed as, tax advice.

Certain Effects of the Merger 

        If the Merger Agreement and the merger are approved by Coastway Bancorp's stockholders and certain other conditions to the closing of the merger are either satisfied or
waived, Massachusetts Acquisitions, LLC, the merger subsidiary of HarborOne Bancorp, will merge with and into Coastway Bancorp, with Coastway Bancorp as the surviving
corporation. Coastway Bancorp will then merge with and into HarborOne Bancorp, with HarborOne Bancorp as the surviving corporation. Contemporaneously, Coastway
Community Bank will merge with and into HarborOne Bank, with HarborOne Bank as the surviving entity.

        When the merger is completed, each outstanding share of common stock of Coastway Bancorp (other than shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock owned by HarborOne
Bancorp) will be converted into the right to receive $28.25 in cash at closing. At the effective time of the merger, Coastway Bancorp's stockholders will cease to have ownership
interests in Coastway Bancorp or rights as stockholders of Coastway Bancorp.

        Coastway Bancorp's shares of common stock are currently registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market
under the symbol "CWAY." As a result of the merger, Coastway Bancorp's common shares will cease to be traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, the registration of
Coastway Bancorp common shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, will be terminated, and Coastway Bancorp will no longer file periodic and other
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Effects on Coastway Bancorp and Our Stockholders if the Merger is Not Completed 

        If the Merger Agreement is not approved by Coastway Bancorp's stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Coastway Bancorp's stockholders will
not receive any payment for their shares in connection with the merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Coastway Bancorp may be required
to pay HarborOne Bancorp a $5.025 million termination fee. For a description of the circumstances obligating payment of the termination fee, see "—Termination Fee."

Appraisal Rights 

        Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if available under the law, enable the stockholders of a corporation to dissent from an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger,
and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to
stockholders in connection with the transaction. Under Maryland law, appraisal rights are not available to holders of shares of any class or series of shares that are listed on a
national securities exchange. Accordingly, the stockholders of Coastway Bancorp do not have appraisal rights with respect to the Merger Agreement and the merger.

Financial Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        As described below, certain of Coastway Bancorp's executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that are in addition to, or different from, the interests of
Coastway Bancorp's stockholders generally. Coastway Bancorp's Board of Directors was aware of these interests and took them into account in approving the merger. These
interests include the following:

        Stock Options and Stock-Based Awards.    The directors and executive officers of Coastway Bancorp held options to purchase an aggregate of 105,460 shares of common
stock as of May 7, 2018. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding stock option granted by Coastway Bancorp under the Coastway
Bancorp, Inc. 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Equity Plan"), whether vested or unvested, will be canceled and the holder of a stock option will receive a

cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock subject to the stock option, and (2) the amount by which $28.25 exceeds the
exercise price of such stock option, less applicable federal and state tax withholdings. If the exercise price of a stock option equals or exceeds $28.25 per share, the holder of such
stock option will not be entitled to any consideration in connection with the merger.

        The directors and executive officers of Coastway Bancorp held 29,117 restricted shares as of May 7, 2018. At the effective time, each restricted stock award granted under
the Equity Plan will vest in full and will no longer be subject to any forfeiture or vesting requirements, and will be considered outstanding for purposes of the right to receive the
merger consideration.

        The following table assumes that the closing of the merger occurs on August 31, 2018, that no stock options (other than expiring stock options, if any) are exercised or
shares of restricted stock are forfeited, and no dividends are paid with respect to the common stock between the date of this proxy statement and the closing of the merger. The
estimated aggregate amounts set forth below are based on the merger consideration of $28.25 in cash, without interest, for each share of common stock, net of the applicable
exercise price (for stock options), multiplied by the total number of shares subject to each applicable award.

        William A. White Employment Agreement.    Coastway Community Bank is a party to an employment agreement with William A. White, which provides that in the event
of his involuntary termination without cause or resignation for good reason in connection with or following a change in control, Mr. White would be entitled to continue to
receive payment of his base salary and continued benefits for five years following such termination. He would also be entitled to one year of continued medical benefits paid by
Coastway Community Bank or its successor. In connection with entering into the Merger Agreement, Mr. White entered into an employment agreement with HarborOne Bancorp
and HarborOne Bank (for purposes of this discussion, the "employers"), which will become effective upon the closing of the merger, at which time his existing employment
agreement with Coastway Community Bank will terminate. Under the new employment agreement, which has a five-year term, Mr. White will be the Director of Banking, Rhode
Island, and will have the primary responsibility for growing and expanding the business of HarborOne Bank's Rhode Island Operations. Mr. White will receive an

annual base salary of $440,000 (or $2.2 million over the five-year term, i.e., the "total compensation") and will be entitled to receive incentive compensation as determined by the
employers' boards of directors. In addition, he will be entitled to substantially similar fringe benefits as he has received from Coastway Community Bank, including a monthly
automobile allowance of $1,250, a paid golf membership to Quidnessett Country Club, four weeks of paid vacation, and a life insurance policy paid by the employers with a
death benefit of $1,500,000 (or the highest amount of coverage as can be purchased by the employers for $10,000) for a period of one year (paid life insurance was not previously
provided). Mr. White may terminate his employment at any time for any reason after 12 months, but only for "good reason" (as defined in the employment agreement) within the
first 12 months of employment. In the event of his termination by the employers without cause at any time under the employment agreement or by Mr. White for good reason
within the first 12 months of employment with the employers, Mr. White will be entitled to his accrued benefit (i.e., any earned but unpaid base salary, unused vacation and
vested benefits under any employee benefit plan) plus an amount equal to remaining balance of the "total compensation" (as defined therein) payable to him under the
employment agreement, the latter paid in substantially equal installments in accordance with the employers' payroll practices over the remaining term of the employment
agreements. In the event of Mr. White's termination with or without good reason after his first 12 months of employment, he will continue to receive the remainder of his total
compensation paid in accordance with the employers' regular payroll practices. During Mr. White's employment with the employers and for 24 months thereafter, regardless of
the reason for termination, he has agreed to be subject to a noncompete and nonsolicitation requirement.

        Coastway Community Bank Executive Change in Control Severance Plan.    Coastway Community Bank entered into an Executive Change in Control Severance Plan
("Severance Plan") covering executive officers Richard Petrarca, Jeanette Fritz, Jana Planka, Stephen J. Gibbons and also covering Suzanne Fry. Under the Severance Plan if,
within a two-year period following a change in control, a participant in the Severance Plan experiences either an involuntary termination of employment without cause or a
voluntary resignation after being offered a position that is not a "comparable position" (as defined therein), the participant will be paid an amount equal to two times the
participant's current base salary plus two times the participant's highest bonus (or in the case of Ms. Fry, two times base salary plus commissions, plus the highest bonus) paid in
the two calendar years immediately prior to such termination. Such amount will be paid ratably over two years, starting no later than 60 days after the termination date, but such
payment is contingent upon the participant signing (and not revoking) a general release of claims. Upon termination of the participant's employment in a manner that results in
payments to the participant under the Severance Plan, for the period of time that severance payments are being made thereunder, the participant agrees not to solicit customers to
terminate their relationships with Coastway Community Bank or its successor. It is expected that Richard Petrarca and Jeanette Fritz will not be retained by HarborOne Bancorp
and will be entitled to a cash severance payment of $521,500 and $572,822, respectively, following their termination of employment pursuant to the Severance Plan over a two-
year period in accordance with normal payroll practices or the present value of such amounts in a lump sum, if the payment is not required to be paid over a two-year period
under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. For these purposes, a "comparable position" is defined as one that (i) provides a participant with base compensation and
benefits that are comparable in the aggregate to those provided before the change in control; (ii) would not increase the participant's commuting distance by more than 50 miles,
and (iii) would require job skills and duties that are comparable to the requirements and duties of the position held by the participant prior to the change in control.

        Continued Employment Offer to Certain Coastway Bancorp Named Executive Officers.    HarborOne Bank has extended letter agreements to Jana Planka, Stephen
Gibbons and Suzanne Fry. Under the letter agreement, Ms. Planka has been offered and has accepted employment as Vice President, Regional Manager of HarborOne Bank
responsible for the Rhode Island branches of the bank, with an

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1585023/000104746918003849/a2235653zdefm14a.htm 51/139

annual salary of $180,000 and will be eligible to participate in or receive benefits under all employee benefit plans to which comparably positioned officers of HarborOne Bank
are entitled. Because the position is not a comparable position to the one she held at Coastway Community Bank, Ms. Planka will be entitled to a lump sum severance payment
under the above Severance Plan approximately equal to $409,390, payable at closing of the merger. By signing the letter agreement Ms. Planka acknowledges that, effective as of
the effective time, the letter agreement supersedes all prior agreements of the same nature. The letter agreement makes clear that Ms. Planka is an employee at will. Her letter
agreement does not entitle her to any further severance benefits upon a termination with HarborOne Bank.

        Mr. Gibbons letter agreement offers him, and he has accepted, the position of Regional Vice President of HarborOne Bank with an annual salary of $275,000, cash incentive
compensation payable in the form of bonus or commission payments and provides that he will be eligible to participate in or receive benefits under all employee benefit plans
available to comparably positioned officers of HarborOne Bank, including health benefits and paid vacation time. Ms. Fry's letter agreement offers her, and she has accepted, the
position of Vice President, Regional Sales Manager of HarborOne Mortgage at an annual base salary of $150,000 and provides that she will be eligible to participate in or receive
benefits under all employee benefit plans available to comparably positioned HarborOne Mortgage employees, including health benefits and paid vacation time. In addition,
Ms. Fry will be eligible to receive on, a monthly basis, commissions for all new loans closed in her region after the closing of the merger, and for any refinancing of any
Coastway Community Bank loan or HarborOne Mortgage loan in her region after the closing. Each of Mr. Gibbons and Ms. Fry's letter agreements indicate that the executives
will be "at will" employees, provided, however, that in the event of their termination of employment without cause or their resignation under "qualifying circumstances" within
the two-year period following the closing of the merger, the executives will be entitled to a severance payment equal to a pro-rated portion of the severance payment to which
they would have been entitled under the Severance Plan discussed above, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of whole months from the date of
termination to the end of the two-year period following the closing of the merger and the denominator of which is 24. In order to receive the severance payment, each executive
would be required to sign and not revoke a release of claims. For these purposes, a "qualifying circumstance" includes (i) the executive's assignment to a position that is not a
comparable position (as defined in the Severance Plan) and (ii) the assignment to a new position that involves a material diminution in base compensation or authority, duties and
responsibilities of either the executive or the executive's supervisor, provided, in either case, the executive has adhered to the requirements of the Severance Plan in giving a
timely notice of the condition permitting resignation. By signing the letter agreements, Mr. Gibbons and Ms. Fry acknowledge that the terms of each letter agreement and
employment offer do not fail to constitute a comparable position. In the event of their termination of employment by HarborOne Bancorp on the day after closing, Mr. Gibbons
and Ms. Fry would be entitled to severance benefits, the present value of which is approximately $620,466 and $670,329, respectively. The payments would be paid in a lump
sum, or if required by applicable tax laws, in installments over a two-year period.

        Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans.    Coastway Community Bank has entered into a 2015 Amended and Restated Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan for
William A. White ("CEO SERP") and a separate Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan for the benefit of certain senior officers, including Mr. White, Jeanette Fritz, Suzanne
Fry, Stephen J. Gibbons, Richard H. Petrarca and Jana M. Planka ("Officer SERP").

        Under the CEO SERP, Coastway Community Bank is required to make annual contributions of $72,000 each January 1 until January 1, 2023, so long as Mr. White remains
employed. Upon Mr. White's separation from service on or after age 67, Coastway Community Bank will pay Mr. White's SERP benefit in 10 approximately equal annual
installments staring on the first business day of January after his separation from service. If Mr. White has a termination of employment prior

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1585023/000104746918003849/a2235653zdefm14a.htm 52/139

Table of Contents

to age 67, his benefit will be paid in a lump sum no later than the first day of the second calendar month following his separation from service, subject to any required six-month
delay that may be imposed under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Mr. White is entitled to direct the investment of the amounts contributed to the CEO SERP. In the
event of a "change in control" (as defined therein), Mr. White would become fully vested in his account, to the extent not already fully vested (presently, he is 85% vested).
Mr. White's aggregate account value as of April 30, 2018 is $1.7 million.

        Under the Officer SERP, participants will receive 60% (70% for Mr. White) of their final average compensation upon separation from service after attaining normal
retirement age (i.e., age 66, 67 or 68, as specified in their benefits schedule), less offsets for the employer's contribution to Coastway Community Bank's 401(k) Retirement Plan
("401(k) Plan") and 50% of the contribution to Social Security. Mr. White's benefit under the Officer SERP is also offset by the benefit under the CEO SERP. Benefits under the
Officer SERP are also reduced if a participant has not completed 20 years of service. Benefits generally vest in 10% increments for each year of service completed after the
effective date of the SERP; however, in the event of a change in control (as defined), participants benefits become fully vested. If a participant separates from service before
normal retirement age, he or she shall be paid the vested accrued benefit in the form selected by the participant (i.e., in a lump sum, monthly installments over five years, or
monthly installments for life, with 15 years guaranteed). If separation is due to "cause" (as defined in the SERP), all benefits are forfeited. In the event of a change in control and
separation from service occurring on August 31, 2018, the SERP benefits payable to the executives is estimated to be approximately $1,027,547 for William A. White, $380,439
for Jeanette Fritz, $129,456 for Suzanne Fry, $584,864 for Stephen J. Gibbons, $699,278 for Richard H. Petrarca and $409,984 for Jana M. Planka.

        Pro-Rata Bonus Payment.    The Merger Agreement permits Coastway Bancorp to pay eligible employees, including Messrs. White, Petrarca, and Gibbons and Mses. Fritz,
Fry and Planka, pro-rata bonuses that have been budgeted by Coastway Bancorp, consistent with past practice and in the ordinary course of business, provided that the amounts
paid do not exceed the monthly accruals of the aggregate bonus payments. The pro-rata bonuses paid to the officers at closing, assuming an August 31, 2018 closing date, is
estimated to be approximately $150,821.

        Employee Stock Ownership Plan.    The Merger Agreement requires Coastway Bancorp to terminate the Coastway Community Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan
("Employee Stock Ownership Plan") immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, whereupon the outstanding share acquisition loan will be repaid in full from the shares
in the suspense account. Coastway Community Bank will prepare any required termination amendment and will prepare and file a request with the Internal Revenue Service to
obtain a favorable determination letter on the termination. The termination amendment will provide that any shares remaining in the suspense account (or the cash proceeds
therefrom) will be allocated to participants employed by Coastway Community Bank at the termination date of the plan, in accordance with their account balances. In connection
with the termination of the Employee Stock Ownership Plan, it is estimated that the additional allocation to the senior executives will be approximately $253,413 for William
A.White, $184,293 for Jeanette Fritz, $123,648 for Suzanne Fry, $231,546 for Stephen J. Gibbons, $187,869 for Richard H. Petrarca and $153,334 for Jana M. Planka.

        Indemnification.    Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, HarborOne Bancorp has agreed that, following the effective time of the merger, it will indemnify and hold harmless
the current and former directors and officers of Coastway Bancorp to the fullest extent such person would have been indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses
pursuant to Coastway Bancorp's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws or as provided by applicable law as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement.

        Directors' and Officers' Insurance.    Prior to the closing of the merger, Coastway Bancorp will purchase extended insurance coverage under the current directors' and
officers' liability insurance, which will provide coverage of acts or omissions of Coastway Bancorp officers and directors occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger
for a period of six years after the effective time of the merger. In obtaining this "tail" insurance coverage, Coastway Bancorp cannot spend, in the aggregate, more than 200% of
the annual premium currently paid by Coastway Bancorp for its directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage.

        Coastway Cares Charitable Foundation II.    Coastway Bancorp has agreed to recommend to the Board of Directors of the Foundation that the current Board of Directors
of the Foundation resign as of the closing of the merger and that, following the completion of the merger, the Board of Directors of the Foundation consist of two representatives
of HarborOne Bancorp and two representatives of Coastway Bancorp, including Mr. White.

Regulatory Approvals 

        General.    Completion of the merger is subject to the receipt of all required approvals and consents from regulatory authorities. The merger of Coastway Bancorp and
HarborOne Bancorp is subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board and the RIDBR. The bank merger is subject to approval by the FDIC, the Massachusetts
Commissioner and the RIDBR. HarborOne Bancorp and HarborOne Bank have filed the requisite applications with the FDIC, RIDBR, Massachusetts Commissioner and the
Federal Reserve Board. As of the date of this proxy statement, action on these applications is pending.

        The approval of any application merely implies the satisfaction of regulatory criteria for approval, which does not include review of the merger from the standpoint of the
adequacy of the merger consideration. Furthermore, regulatory approvals do not constitute an endorsement or recommendation of the merger. There can be no assurance that the
requisite regulatory approvals will be obtained, and if obtained, there can be no assurance as to the date of any approval. There can also be no assurance that any regulatory
approvals will not contain a burdensome condition or requirement that would prevent consummation of the merger.

        Federal Reserve Board.    The merger of Coastway Bancorp and Massachusetts Acquisitions, LLC and the merger of Coastway Bancorp and HarborOne Bancorp are
subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board. In evaluating whether to grant such approval, the Federal Reserve Board considers such factors as the financial and
managerial resources and future prospects of the holding companies and institutions involved, as well as the convenience and needs of the communities served and competitive
factors.

        FDIC.    The bank merger is subject to the approval of the FDIC under the Bank Merger Act. In granting its approval, the FDIC must consider the financial and managerial
resources and future prospects of the existing and resulting institutions, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, competitive factors, any risk to the stability
of the United States banking or financial system and the effectiveness of the institutions involved in combating money laundering activities. In addition, a period of 15 to 30 days
must expire following approval by the FDIC before completion of the bank merger is allowed, within which period the U.S. Department of Justice may file objections to the
merger under the federal antitrust laws. While the parties believe that the likelihood of objection by the Department of Justice is remote in this case, there can be no assurance
that the Department of Justice will not initiate proceedings to block the bank merger.

        RIDBR.    The merger and the bank merger are also subject to the approval of the RIDBR pursuant to Rhode Island law. In granting its approval, the RIDBR will consider,
among other things, whether the mergers promote the safety and soundness of the Rhode Island entity to be acquired and

Table of Contents

the convenience and advantage of the communities served by that entity, and whether the acquisition is likely to have a significant impact on Rhode Island's economy,
employment levels and tax base.

        Massachusetts Commissioner.    The bank merger is also subject to the approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner pursuant to Massachusetts law. In determining whether
to approve the application, the Commissioner of Banks will consider, among other factors, whether competition among banking institutions will be unreasonably affected,
whether public convenience and advantage will be promoted and whether the bank merger will result in "net new benefits" within the resulting institution's Community
Reinvestment Act assessment area.

Accounting Treatment 

        HarborOne Bancorp will account for the merger under the purchase method of accounting. This means that HarborOne Bancorp and Coastway Bancorp will be treated as
one company as of the date of the merger and HarborOne Bancorp will record the fair value of Coastway Bancorp's assets and liabilities on its financial statements on that date.
HarborOne Bancorp will record the excess of its purchase price over the fair value of Coastway Bancorp's identifiable net assets as goodwill.

Terms of the Merger Agreement 

        The following describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The following description of the Merger Agreement is subject, and qualified in its entirety by

Treatment of Coastway Bancorp Stock Options and Stock-Based Awards 

        Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each outstanding stock option granted by Coastway Bancorp under the Equity Plan, whether vested or
unvested, will be canceled and the holder of a stock option will receive a cash payment equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Coastway Bancorp common stock
subject to the stock option, and (2) the amount by which $28.25 exceeds the exercise price of such stock option, less applicable federal and state tax withholdings. If the exercise
price of a stock option equals or exceeds $28.25 per share, the holder of such stock option will not be entitled to any consideration in connection with the merger.

        Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each restricted stock award granted under the Equity Plan will vest in full and will be considered
outstanding for purposes of the right to receive the merger consideration.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger 

        The merger will be completed only if all conditions to complete the merger set forth in the Merger Agreement are either satisfied or waived. See "—Conditions to Complete
the Merger." As promptly as possible after all of the conditions to completion of the merger have been satisfied or waived, the parties will file articles of merger with the
Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland. The merger of Massachusetts Acquisitions, LLC and Coastway Bancorp will become effective when the
articles are filed. The completion of the merger is currently anticipated to occur during the second quarter of 2018, but neither Coastway Bancorp nor HarborOne Bancorp can
guarantee when or if the merger will be completed.

        Certain representations and warranties of HarborOne Bancorp and Coastway Bancorp are qualified as to "materiality" or limited where the failure of a representation or
warranty to be true and correct would not have a "material adverse effect." For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a "material adverse effect," when used in reference to
HarborOne Bancorp or Coastway Bancorp, as applicable, means any event, circumstance, change or effect, individually or in the aggregate, that would reasonably be expected to
be materially adverse to the business, prospects, operations, assets, liabilities, condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations, cash flows or properties of HarborOne
Bancorp or Coastway Bancorp, taken as a whole, or would reasonably be expected to prevent HarborOne Bancorp or Coastway Bancorp from performing its obligations under
the Merger Agreement or consummating the merger. However, any facts, changes, events, developments or effects (i) arising after the date of the Merger Agreement that affect
banks or their holding companies generally, (ii) arising from general changes in business or economic conditions or laws or accounting regulations, (iii) actions and omissions
taken with the prior written consent of the other party in furtherance of the transactions contemplated or otherwise permitted under the Merger Agreement, (iv) any fact, change,
event, development, effect or circumstance resulting from the announcement or pendency of the Merger Agreement, (v) due to the failure of HarborOne Bancorp or Coastway
Bancorp to meet any internal revenue or earnings projections, or (vi) changes in the trading price or trading volume of HarborOne common stock, will not constitute a "material
adverse effect."

to the completion of the merger, (ii) any of the conditions to completion of the merger not being satisfied, or (iii) a material violation of any provision of the
Merger Agreement; or

• agree to do any of the foregoing.

        HarborOne Bancorp has agreed that it will not, and it will not permit any of its subsidiaries to, (i) knowingly take any action that would cause a material delay in or
impediment to the consummation of the merger, (ii) take any action that would adversely affect its ability to obtain required regulatory approvals for the merger, or (iii) take any
action that is intended or is reasonably likely to result in any of the conditions to the closing of the merger not being satisfied.

        Regulatory Matters.    Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, HarborOne Bancorp agreed to make all appropriate filings with regulatory authorities for approval of the merger
by April 28, 2018. HarborOne Bancorp has the primary responsibility for the preparation of the necessary applications for regulatory approval of the merger; however, the parties
will cooperate in preparing the applications and HarborOne Bancorp will provide Coastway Bancorp with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all its public, non-
confidential substantive written filings contemplated under the Merger Agreement.

        Coastway Bancorp's Stockholder Meeting and Recommendation of Coastway Bancorp's Board of Directors.    Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Coastway Bancorp has
agreed to hold a meeting of its stockholders to vote on the approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger within 45 days of mailing this proxy statement to Coastway
Bancorp stockholders, and to solicit from Coastway Bancorp stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement and the merger.

        Coastway Bancorp's Board of Directors has unanimously agreed to recommend that Coastway Bancorp's stockholders vote in favor of approval of the Merger Agreement
and the merger. However, the Board of Directors may withdraw, modify or change its recommendation if it determines, in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel, that
such action is reasonably necessary for it to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, as described below under "—Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers."

        Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers.    Coastway Bancorp has agreed that it and its affiliates, including its officers, directors and representatives, will not solicit, initiate,
knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any merger or acquisition proposals, offers or inquiries from a third party, or furnish to a third party any information or access to
Coastway Bancorp's businesses, properties, assets or personnel in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating a third party acquisition proposal or any
inquires, proposals or offers that could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, if before the Coastway Bancorp
special meeting of stockholders, Coastway Bancorp receives an unsolicited third party acquisition proposal that the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a superior
proposal, and Coastway Bancorp's Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under Maryland law, then Coastway Bancorp may furnish information to and engage in
discussions and negotiations with the third party making such proposal.

        Coastway Bancorp must notify HarborOne Bancorp within 24 hours if it receives any third-party acquisition proposal, offer or inquiry and provide a copy of any
information about the proposal, offer or inquiry, including the identity of the party. Coastway Bancorp thereafter will keep HarborOne informed on a current basis (daily) of the
status of any material developments.

Table of Contents

        If Coastway Bancorp receives a superior proposal prior to the approval of the Merger Agreement by the Coastway Bancorp stockholders, it may not terminate the Merger
Agreement and the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors may not change its recommendation that Coastway Bancorp stockholders vote to approve the Merger Agreement and
the merger, until the fifth business day following delivery of written notice to HarborOne Bancorp that it intends to make an adverse recommendation change. During such five-
business day period (or three business day period if an amended proposal), Coastway Bancorp will, to the extent requested by HarborOne Bancorp, negotiate with HarborOne
Bancorp in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement as would enable Coastway Bancorp to maintain the Board of Director's
recommendation and not to terminate the Merger Agreement. Following such period, if Coastway Bancorp's Board of Directors have determined in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into consideration any amendments to the Merger Agreement proposed by HarborOne Bancorp, that the failure to
make an adverse recommendation change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Maryland law and that such acquisition proposal
continues to be a superior proposal, then Coastway Bancorp may change its recommendation and terminate the Merger Agreement.

        For purposes of the Merger Agreement, an "acquisition proposal" means any bona fide written offer or proposal from any third party involving (i) the acquisition or
purchase, directly or indirectly, of 20% or more of any class of outstanding voting or equity securities of Coastway Bancorp, or any tender offer or exchange offer that would
result in such third party beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of outstanding voting or equity securities of Coastway Bancorp, (ii) any merger, amalgamation,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, acquisition, license, joint venture or other similar transaction involving Coastway Bancorp or Coastway Community Bank,
the business of which constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of Coastway Bancorp and Coastway Community Bank, taken as a whole, (iii) any
liquidation, dissolution, recapitalization, extraordinary dividend or other significant corporate reorganization of Coastway Bancorp or Coastway Community Bank, the business
of which constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of Coastway Bancorp and Coastway Community Bank, taken as a whole, (iv) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, acquisition, license, joint venture, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar transaction involving Coastway Bancorp
pursuant to which the stockholders of Coastway Bancorp immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 80% of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting entity of
such transaction or (v) any combination of the foregoing.

        For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a "superior proposal" means a bona fide written acquisition proposal (with all of the percentages included in the definition of
acquisition proposal increased to 50%) received after the date of the Merger Agreement that was not solicited or negotiated in breach of the Merger Agreement, that the Board of
Directors of Coastway Bancorp determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel such proposal (in each case taking into
account any changes to the Merger Agreement proposed by HarborOne Bancorp in response to such proposal) (i) is reasonably capable of being completed in accordance with its
terms, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, including all conditions contained therein and the person making such proposal, and
(ii) is more favorable to the stockholders of Coastway Bancorp from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

        Indemnification and Directors' and Officers' Insurance.    HarborOne Bancorp has agreed that it will indemnify current and former directors and officers of Coastway
Bancorp to the fullest extent such person would have been indemnified pursuant to Coastway Bancorp's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws following the completion of the
merger, and, prior to closing, Coastway Bancorp will cause to be maintained for a period of six years after the effective time of the merger under the current directors' and
officers' liability insurance extended insurance coverage of acts or omissions occurring at

or prior to the effective time of the merger with respect to the officers and directors of Coastway Bancorp, subject to a limit on premium payments. See "—Financial Interests of
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Indemnification" and "—Financial Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Directors' and Officers'
Insurance" above for a complete description.

        Employees and Benefit Plans.    HarborOne Bancorp has agreed to provide employees of Coastway Bancorp and Coastway Community Bank who remain employed after
the effective time with at least the types and levels of employee benefits comparable in the aggregate to those maintained by Coastway Bancorp and Coastway Community Bank
for similarly situated employees, excluding certain retiree health or life insurance benefits. HarborOne Bancorp will treat the service of the continuing employees as service with
HarborOne Bank for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, but not for benefit accrual in certain cases, under HarborOne Bancorp's and HarborOne Bank's benefit
plans. With respect to HarborOne Bancorp's health plans, continuing employees will receive credit towards deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket expenses upon delivery
of appropriate documentation, subject to the terms and conditions of such programs. No continuing employees will lose health coverage under a Coastway health plan until such
time as such continuing employees and their dependents are eligible for coverage under the health plans of HarborOne Bancorp and HarborOne Bank.

        HarborOne Bancorp has agreed to honor and perform, in accordance with their terms, all contractual rights of current and former employees of Coastway Bancorp and
Coastway Community Bank existing as of the effective time, including under any employment, severance, deferred compensation and change in control agreements. After
closing, HarborOne Bancorp will have sole discretion whether to terminate, merge or continue any Coastway Bancorp or Coastway Community Bank employee benefit plan or
program, subject to limits under applicable law. In addition, HarborOne Bancorp has agreed to provide severance benefits to certain employees who are not covered by an
employment agreement or other agreement providing for severance benefits, provided that the terminated employee enters into a separation agreement containing a release of
claims. HarborOne Bancorp has also agreed that, in consultation with Coastway Bancorp, that HarborOne Bancorp will designate certain employees to receive a retention bonus,
provided that such employees remain continuing employees for the period determined by HarborOne Bancorp, which may extend to the systems conversion date.

        If requested by HarborOne Bancorp no later than 30 days prior to the closing, Coastway Bancorp has agreed to terminate Coastway Bank's 401(k) plan effective as of the
day prior to the effective time and continuing employees will be entitled to immediately participate in HarborOne Bancorp's 401(k) plan. Coastway Bancorp has also agreed to
terminate the Coastway Community Bank ESOP, effective as of or immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and to repay the outstanding share acquisition loan
obtained from Coastway Bancorp with unallocated shares held in the ESOP suspense account, assuming a value equal to the merger consideration. Coastway Bancorp and
HarborOne Bancorp have agreed to work with the ESOP trustee to coordinate the preparation of the necessary documentation to file a request with the Internal Revenue Service
for a determination letter on the termination.

        Coastway Cares Charitable Foundation II.    Coastway Bancorp has agreed to recommend to the Board of Directors of the Foundation that the current Board of Directors
of the Foundation resign as of the closing of the merger and that, following the completion of the merger, the Board of Directors of the Foundation consist of two representatives
of HarborOne Bancorp who also serve on the Board of Directors of The HarborOne Foundation, William A. White, and one other person designated by Coastway Bancorp. In
addition, Coastway Bancorp has agreed to recommend to the Foundation that the Foundation change its name to "The HarborOne Foundation Rhode Island" and that the
Foundation should continue its focus of charitable giving in Rhode Island.

• the receipt of required regulatory approvals and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods, which approvals must not include any "burdensome condition,"

appropriate party.

Termination of the Merger Agreement 

        The Merger Agreement can be terminated at any time before completion of the merger by mutual consent of the parties, or by either party in the following circumstances:

• if the Coastway Bancorp stockholders fail to approve the Merger Agreement and the merger at the special meeting of stockholders.

        HarborOne Bancorp may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, withdraws, modifies or
changes, in any manner adverse to HarborOne Bancorp, its recommendation that Coastway Bancorp stockholders vote to approve the Merger Agreement, or if Coastway Bancorp
has materially breached its covenant not to solicit any other acquisition proposals from third parties.

        In addition, Coastway Bancorp may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors, in the exercise of its fiduciary duties following the
receipt of a superior acquisition proposal from a third party, withdraws, modifies or changes, in any manner adverse to HarborOne Bancorp, its recommendation that Coastway
Bancorp stockholders vote to approve the Merger Agreement, provided that Coastway Bancorp has complied with its obligations to provide notice of such superior proposal to
HarborOne Bancorp and to renegotiate the Merger Agreement with HarborOne Bancorp, and only if Coastway Bancorp pays a termination fee of $5.025 million in connection
with the termination of the Merger Agreement.

Effect of Termination 

        If the Merger Agreement is terminated, it will become void, except that (1) any liability of either HarborOne Bancorp or Coastway Bancorp for any willful breach of their
respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under the Merger Agreement or fraud will survive the termination, and (2) certain provisions of the Merger
Agreement will survive the termination, including those relating to payment of fees and expenses and the confidential treatment of information.

        If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Coastway Bancorp must pay HarborOne Bancorp in immediately available funds a termination fee of
$5.025 million.

        Coastway Bancorp must pay the termination fee if:

• HarborOne Bancorp terminates the Merger Agreement because the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors withdraws, modifies or changes, in any manner adverse
to HarborOne Bancorp, its recommendation that Coastway Bancorp stockholders vote to approve the Merger Agreement, or because Coastway Bancorp has
materially breached its covenant not to solicit any other acquisition proposals from third parties; 

• Coastway Bancorp terminates the Merger Agreement because the Coastway Bancorp Board of Directors following the receipt of a superior acquisition proposal
from a third party, withdraws, modifies or changes, in any manner adverse to HarborOne Bancorp, its recommendation that Coastway Bancorp stockholders vote
to approve the Merger Agreement; 

• either party terminates the Merger Agreement because the Coastway Bancorp stockholders have failed to approve the Merger Agreement or the merger is not

stockholders meeting or prior to December 31, 2018, as applicable, and (2) within 12 months following the termination of the Merger Agreement, Coastway

PROPOSAL 2—ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        If there are not sufficient votes to constitute a quorum or to approve Proposal 1 at the time of the special meeting, the proposal may not be approved unless the special
meeting is adjourned or postponed to a later date or dates to permit further solicitation of proxies. To allow proxies that have been received by Coastway Bancorp at the time of
the special meeting to be voted for an adjournment or postponement, if necessary, Coastway Bancorp has submitted the question of adjournment to its stockholders as a separate
matter for their consideration. The special meeting may be postponed or adjourned to solicit additional proxies. The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that
stockholders vote "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal. If it is necessary to adjourn or postpone the special meeting, no notice of the adjourned special meeting is required to be
given to stockholders (unless a new record date is fixed), other than an announcement at the special meeting of the hour, date and place to which the special meeting is adjourned.

        Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares cast at the special meeting.

OTHER MATTERS

Meeting of Stockholders is changed by more than 30 days, any stockholder proposal must be received at a reasonable time before we print or mail proxy materials for such
meeting. Any such proposals shall be subject to the requirements of the proxy rules adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

ADVANCE NOTICE OF BUSINESS TO BE CONDUCTED AT AN ANNUAL MEETING

ARTICLE II—MERGER CONSIDERATION;
EXCHANGE PROCEDURES 

        2.1    Merger Consideration.    Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Buyer, the Company and Merger LLC or any stockholder of the Company:

        (a)   Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Buyer ("Buyer Common Stock") that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain issued and outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

        (b)   Each membership interest of Merger LLC immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time without any conversion
thereof, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

        (c)   Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Buyer Company Stock) shall become and be
converted into, as provided in and subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the right to receive $28.25 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration").

        2.2    Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers.    All shares of Company Common Stock, when converted as provided in Section 2.1(c), shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate or direct registration statement (a "Certificate") previously evidencing such shares shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive, for each such share of Company Common Stock, the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common
Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided under this Article II. After
the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock, other than transfers of Company Common
Stock that have occurred prior to the Effective Time.

        2.3    Exchange Procedures.    

        (a)   On or before the Closing Date, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, Buyer shall deliver, or shall cause to be delivered, to a bank or trust company
designated by Buyer and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), an aggregate amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable under Section 2.1(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
make all such payments, Buyer shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in
the amount of funds required to make such payments.

        (b)   As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, and provided that the
Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all information which is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its obligations as
specified herein, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates, a form of letter of transmittal in a form reasonably satisfactory to
the Buyer and the Company (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) of this Agreement. Upon proper
surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check representing that amount of

cash to which such former holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to
this Agreement, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), each Certificate shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration provided in Section 2.1. No interest shall be paid
or accrued on any cash constituting Merger Consideration.

        (c)   The Exchange Agent or Buyer, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to deliver cash to which a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be
entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided
in this Section 2.3, or an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond in an amount as may be required in each case by Buyer or the Exchange
Agent.

        (d)   Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for twelve months after the Effective Time (as well as any
interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore
complied with Section 2.3(b) shall thereafter look only to Buyer for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such
stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of Company Common Stock
are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed on or before the day prior to the date on which such cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law, become the property of Buyer
(and to the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the
Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration
paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer
books of the Company to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock represented by any Certificate, Buyer and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with
respect to any claims thereto.

        (e)   Buyer (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under applicable law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Buyer.

        2.4    Options and Other Stock-Based Awards.    

        (a)   Each option to purchase Company Common Stock (collectively, the "Company Stock Options") granted under the Coastway Bancorp, Inc. 2015 Equity
Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Company Equity Plan"), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which has not
been exercised or canceled prior thereto shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled and, as of the Effective Time, the Company shall pay to the holder thereof cash in an
amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock provided for in such Company Stock Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger

Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock provided for in such Company Stock Option, which cash payment shall be made without
interest and shall be net of all applicable withholding taxes. At the Effective Time, the Company Equity Plan shall terminate and shall be of no further force and effect and
shall be deemed to be deleted. The Company shall take all actions necessary in order to effect the provisions of this Section 2.4, including, without limitation, seeking all
necessary approvals and providing any notices required under the Company Equity Plan.

        (b)   As of the Effective Time, all restricted stock awards granted under the Company Equity Plan shall vest in full so as to no longer be subject to any forfeiture or
vesting requirements, and all such shares of Company Common Stock shall be considered outstanding shares for all purposes of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, for purposes of the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto.

        (c)   The Company and the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Equity
Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary or appropriate actions in order to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.4.

        2.5    Reservation of Right to Revise Structure.    Buyer may at any time change the method of effecting the business combination contemplated by this Agreement if and to
the extent that it deems such a change to be desirable; provided, however, that no such change shall (a) alter or change the amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to
holders of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options as Merger Consideration as contemplated in this Agreement, (b) reasonably be expected to materially impede or
delay consummation of the Merger, (c) require submission to or approval of the Company's stockholders after receipt of the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock in order to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Company Stockholder Approval") or (d) result in materially adverse
tax consequences to be realized by the stockholders of the Company. In the event that Buyer elects to make such a change, the parties agree to execute appropriate documents to
reflect the change.

predecessors or the predecessors of its Subsidiaries, respectively, and any reference to the Company shall be deemed to include its Subsidiaries, including any predecessors of its
Subsidiaries, except where explicitly inconsistent with the language of this Section 3.13. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule:

        (a)   The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed all Tax Returns that it was required to file under applicable laws and regulations, other than Tax Returns that

time within which to file any Tax Return and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries currently has any open tax years ending before December 31, 2014. No
claim has ever been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where the Company does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There

        (d)   The Company has made available to Buyer true and complete copies of the United States federal, state, local, and foreign income Tax Returns filed with respect

letter rulings, technical advice memoranda, and similar documents, and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by the Company filed for the years ended
on or after December 31, 2014. The Company has timely and properly taken such actions in response to and, in compliance with notices, the Company has received from
the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") in respect of information reporting and backup and nonresident withholding as are required by law.

liability for the Taxes of any individual, bank, corporation, partnership, association, joint stock company, business trust, limited liability company, or unincorporated
organization (other than the Company) under Reg. Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or
otherwise.

        (g)   The unpaid Taxes of the Company (i) did not, as of December 31, 2017, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (which reserve is distinct and different from any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Company Financial Statements (rather than
in any notes thereto), and (ii) do not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company in filing its
Tax Returns. Since December 31, 2017, the Company has not incurred any liability for Taxes arising from extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP,
outside the ordinary course of business consistent with past custom and practice.

determination or approval letter from the IRS with respect to such qualification, or may rely on an opinion letter issued by the IRS with respect to a prototype plan
adopted in accordance with the requirements for such reliance, or has time remaining for application to the IRS for a determination of the qualified status of such
Company Employee Program for any period for which such Company Employee Program would not otherwise be covered by an IRS determination and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no event or omission has occurred that would cause any Company Employee Program to lose such qualification.

        (d)   Each Company Employee Program is, and has been operated, in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations and is and has been administered in

effect and all claims thereunder have been filed in a due and timely manner and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no such claim has been denied. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is in breach of or default under any insurance policy, and there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would

that notwithstanding anything else to the contrary herein, the Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Meeting (A) with the consent of Buyer, (B) if, on a date on which

any amendment or supplement thereto), or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Buyer and its counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall consider Buyer's comments in good faith. The Company shall ensure that the Proxy Statement

other parties hereto and to obtain such party's consent but has been unable to do so prior to the time such press release or public statement is so required to be issued or made,
(ii) the Company will not be obligated to engage in such consultation with respect to communications that are (1) principally directed to employees, customers, partners or

involving Buyer or Buyer Bank, and Buyer shall be reasonably responsive to requests by the Company for information relating to the Buyer's representations, warranties
and covenants set forth in this Agreement. Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access

Company and the Company Board may not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change except as permitted by Section 6.6(b)(ii); and (iii) making any disclosure that
constitutes a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, which

Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Regulatory Approvals, and (b) to comply

on the future operation by Buyer and its Subsidiaries of their business, taken as a whole (together, the "Burdensome Conditions"). Provided that the Company has cooperated as
required above, Buyer agrees to file the requisite applications or notices to be filed by it with the FRB, the FDIC and the Commissioner. Each of Buyer and the Company shall
have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
with respect to, all material written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that it will consult with the other
parties hereto with respect to the obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other parties reasonably apprised of the status of material matters relating to

law as in effect as of the date hereof with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, including without limitation the right to advancement of expenses,

        (b)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance coverage for the Company's directors and officers in a form acceptable to the Company which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six
years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms at least as favorable to, the insured persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company, so long as the aggregate cost is not more than 200% of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such insurance (the "Premium Limit"). In the event that the Premium Limit is insufficient for such coverage, the Company may enter into an agreement
to spend up to that amount to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount.

        (c)   In the event Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.

        6.10    Employees and Benefit Plans.    

        (a)   After the Effective Time, Buyer agrees to provide the employees of the Company and Company Bank who remain employed after the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Continuing Employees") with at least the types and levels of employee benefits comparable in the aggregate to those then maintained by Buyer for
similarly-situated employees of Buyer (but excluding any retiree health or life insurance benefit, in each case only to the extent that other newly hired employees of Buyer
are not eligible for such benefits). Buyer will treat, and cause its applicable Buyer Employee Programs to treat, the service of the Continuing Employees as service
rendered to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for level of benefits (but not for benefit accrual under any defined benefit
plan for purposes of severance benefits, for any purposes under any post-termination/retiree welfare benefit plan or for purposes of any equity based compensation)
attributable to any period before the Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing, but subject to the terms and conditions of Buyer's applicable Buyer Employee
Programs, Buyer shall cause the Company's employees to receive credit for their prior service for eligibility and vesting purposes in Buyer's 401(k) plan and for purposes
of determining the length of vacation, sick time, paid time off and severance under the Buyer's applicable plan or policy. Buyer shall also ensure that Continuing
Employees shall not be treated as "new" employees for purposes of any exclusions under any health or similar plan of Buyer for a pre-existing medical condition to the
extent that any such exclusion did not apply under a health or similar plan of the Company or Company Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time, and to provide that
any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket expenses paid under any of the Company's or Company Bank's health plans shall be credited towards deductibles, co-
payments or out-of-pocket expenses under Buyer's health plans upon delivery to Buyer of appropriate documentation, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable
Buyer Employee Program. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.10, service and other amounts shall not be credited to Continuing Employees (or
their eligible dependents) to the extent the crediting of such service or other amounts would result in the duplication of benefits. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to
the contrary, none of the provisions contained herein shall operate to duplicate any benefit provided to any Continuing Employee or the funding of any such benefit.

        (b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer shall have sole discretion with respect to the determination as to whether or when to
terminate, merge or continue any employee benefit plans and programs of the Company, subject to limitations set forth under applicable law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, unless a Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage (or causes coverage to terminate) under a Company or Company Bank health plan prior to the
time such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in the Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary health plan, no coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their
dependents shall terminate under any of the Company or Company Bank health plans prior to the time such Continuing Employees and their dependents become eligible
to participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees of the Buyer or Buyer Subsidiary and their dependents.

        (c)   From and after the Effective Time, Buyer agrees to honor and perform, in accordance with their terms, all contractual rights of current and former employees of
the Company or Company Bank existing as of the Effective Time, including, without limitation, all employment, severance, deferred compensation and change in control
agreements of the Company and Company Bank listed in Schedule 6.10(c).

        (d)   If requested by Buyer no later than 30 days prior to Closing, the Company shall terminate its 401(k) plan effective as of the day prior to the Effective Time (but
contingent upon the occurrence thereof) and adopt all required compliance amendments pursuant to written resolutions, the form and substance of which shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. If the

Company 401(k) plan is terminated, Buyer agrees to permit participants in the Company 401(k) plan who are continuing employees of the Buyer to roll over their account
balances and outstanding loan balances from such plan to the Buyer's 401(k) plan, and such continuing employees who satisfy the eligibility requirements of Buyer's
401(k) plan (taking into account credit for prior years of service with the Company pursuant to Section 6.10(a)) shall be eligible to immediately participate in the Buyer's
401(k) plan.

        (e)   Buyer agrees to honor the severance guidelines attached as Schedule 6.10(e) in connection with the termination of employment of any employee of the
Company or Company Bank, other than an employee who is a party to an employment agreement, change in control agreement or other separation agreement that
provides a benefit on a termination of employment, whose employment is terminated involuntarily (other than for Cause, as defined in Schedule 6.10(e)) within one year
following the Effective Time, by providing a lump sum severance payment in such amounts, at such times and upon such conditions as set forth on said Schedule,
including without limitation the effectiveness of a separation agreement with the terminated employee of the Company or Company Bank in a form as determined by
Buyer, which includes, without limitation, a release of legal claims.

        (f)    Within 45 days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall designate, in consultation with the Company, certain employees of the Company or Company Bank
who will be entitled to receive a retention bonus from Buyer in the event such employee remains a Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date and/or through a post-
Closing transition period to be determined by Buyer, including systems conversion, if applicable.

        (g)   From the date hereof through the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Bank to, provide Buyer with reasonable access (at reasonable times,
upon reasonable notice and in a manner that will not materially interfere with the normal operations of the Company) to the (i) employees of the Company and Company
Bank and (ii) the Company's human resources personnel and personnel records (to the extent not prohibited by applicable law) for purposes of (A) facilitating an orderly
transition of such employees from and after the Closing, (B) making announcements concerning, and preparing for the consummation of, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (C) engaging, communicating or meeting with and/or presenting to such employees on either an individual or group basis with respect to matters
related to their prospective continued employment with Buyer on and after the Closing. The Company and Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to consult with each
other, and will consider in good faith each other's advice, prior to sending any notices or other communication materials to the employees of the Company and Company
Bank regarding this Agreement, the Merger or the effects thereof on the employment, compensation or benefits of such employees and, in any case, any such notice or
communication materials shall comply with applicable law.

        (h)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 6.10 shall (h) be treated as an amendment of any particular Employee Program or any other
employee benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement or (ii) give any third party, including any Continuing Employee, any former employee of the Company
or Company Bank or any beneficiary representative thereof, any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.10. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to
(x) confer upon any employee of the Company or Company Bank, any Continuing Employee or any other Person any right to continued employment after the Effective
Time or (y) prevent Buyer or any of its Affiliates from amending, modifying or terminating any Employee Program or any other employee benefit plan, program, policy,
agreement or arrangement in accordance with the terms of such Employee Program.

        (i)    The ESOP shall be terminated, effective as of or immediately prior to the Effective Time and the outstanding ESOP obligation shall be repaid to the Company,

Time, the Buyer Bank shall cause the Committee (as defined in the ESOP) and the ESOP Trustee to take all other actions and prepare all documents necessary in
furtherance of the termination and the administration of the ESOP until all assets thereunder are distributed, including, without limitation, preparing and filing all

Board of Directors
Coastway Bancorp, Inc.
One Coastway Boulevard
Warwick, RI 02886

Ladies and Gentlemen:

        Coastway Bancorp, Inc. ("Company"), HarborOne Bancorp, Inc. ("Buyer") and Massachusetts Acquisitions, LLC, a limited liability company of which Buyer is the sole
member ("Merger LLC"), are proposing to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") pursuant to which Merger LLC will merge with and into Company
with Company as the surviving entity and, immediately thereafter, the Company will merge with and into Buyer with Buyer as the surviving entity (the "Merger"). Pursuant to
the terms of the Agreement, on the Effective Date each issued and outstanding share of Company common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Company Common Stock"), shall
become and be converted into the right to receive $28.25 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the
meanings assigned to them in the Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement. You have requested our opinion as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to the holders of Company Common Stock.

        Sandler O'Neill & Partners, L.P. ("Sandler O'Neill", "we" or "our"), as part of its investment banking business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of financial institutions
and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions. In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed and considered, among other
things: (i) a draft of the Agreement, dated March 9, 2018; (ii) certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of Company that we
deemed relevant; (iii) certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of Buyer that we deemed relevant; (iv) internal financial
projections for Company for the years ending December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2021, as provided by the senior management of Company; (v) the pro forma financial
impact of the Merger on Buyer's capital ratios given certain assumptions relating to estimated transaction expenses and purchase accounting adjustments, as provided by the
senior management of Buyer; (vi) a comparison of certain financial information for Company with similar financial institutions for which information is publicly available;
(vii) the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the bank and thrift industry (on a regional and nationwide basis), to the extent publicly available; (viii) the
current market environment generally and the banking environment in particular; and (ix) such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial,
economic and market criteria as we considered relevant. We also discussed with certain members of the senior management of Company

the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of Company and held similar discussions with certain members of the senior management of Buyer and its
representatives regarding the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of Buyer.

        In performing our review, we have relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information that was available to and reviewed by us from
public sources, that was provided to us by Company or Buyer or their respective representatives or that was otherwise reviewed by us and we have assumed such accuracy and
completeness for purposes of rendering this opinion without any independent verification or investigation. We have relied on the assurances of the respective managements of
Company and Buyer that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make any of such information inaccurate or misleading. We have not been asked to and
have not undertaken an independent verification of any of, such information and we do not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof. We did
not make an independent evaluation or perform an appraisal of the specific assets, the collateral securing assets or the liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Company or Buyer
or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. We render no opinion or evaluation on the collectability of
any assets or the future performance of any loans of Company or Buyer or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries. We did not make an independent evaluation of the
adequacy of the allowance for loan losses of Company or Buyer or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries, or the combined entity after the Merger, and we have not
reviewed any individual credit files relating to Company or Buyer or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries. We have assumed, with your consent, that the respective
allowances for loan losses for Company, Buyer and their respective affiliates or subsidiaries are adequate to cover such losses and will be, adequate on a pro forma basis for the
combined entity.

        In preparing its analyses, Sandler O'Neill used internal financial projections for Company for the years ending December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2021, as provided
by the senior management of Company. Sandler O'Neill also received and used in its pro forma analyses certain assumptions relating to estimated transaction expenses and
purchase accounting adjustments, as provided by the senior management of Buyer. With respect to the foregoing information, the respective senior managements of Company
and Buyer confirmed to us that such information reflected the best currently available projections and estimates of those respective senior managements of the future financial
performance of Company and Buyer, respectively, and we assumed that such performance would be achieved. We express no opinion as to such projections or estimates, or the
assumptions on which they are based. We have also assumed that there has been no material change in Company's or Buyer's, or any of their respective affiliates' or subsidiaries',
assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects since the date of the most recent financial statements made available to us. We have assumed in all respects
material to our analysis that Company and Buyer will remain as going concerns for all periods relevant to our analyses.

        We have also assumed, with your consent, that (i) each of the parties to the Agreement will comply in all material respects with all material terms and conditions of the
Agreement and all related agreements, that all of the representations and warranties contained in such agreements are true and correct in all material respects, that each of the
parties to such agreements will perform in all material respects all of the covenants and other obligations required to be performed by such party under such agreements and that
the conditions precedent in such agreements are not and will not be waived, (ii) in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases
with respect to the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Company, Buyer or the Merger or any related
transaction, and (iii) the Merger and any related transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement without any waiver, modification or amendment
of any material term, condition or agreement thereof and in compliance with all applicable laws and other requirements. Finally, with your consent, we have relied

upon the advice that Company has received from its legal, accounting and tax advisors as to all legal, accounting and tax matters relating to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Agreement. We express no opinion as to any such matters.

        Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events
occurring after the date hereof could materially affect this opinion. We have not undertaken to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw this opinion or otherwise comment upon
events occurring after the date hereof.

        We have acted as Company's financial advisor in connection with the Merger and will receive a fee for our services, a significant portion of which is contingent upon
consummation of the Merger. We will also receive a fee for rendering this opinion, which opinion fee will be credited in full towards the portion of the transaction fee which will
become payable to Sandler O'Neill upon consummation of the Merger. Company has also agreed to indemnify us against certain claims and liabilities arising out of our
engagement and to reimburse us for certain of our out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with our engagement. We have not provided any other investment banking
services to Company in the two years preceding the date hereof. As we have previously advised you, we have provided investment banking services to, and received fees from,
Buyer in the two years preceding the date hereof In 2016, in connection with Buyer's reorganization into a two-tier mutual holding company structure, Sandler O'Neill was
retained by Buyer to manage the subscription offering and community offering and to also perform records management services in connection therewith. In addition, in the
ordinary course of our business as a broker-dealer, we may purchase securities from and sell securities to Company, Buyer and their respective affiliates. We may also actively
trade the equity and debt securities of Company, Buyer and their respective affiliates for our own account and for the accounts of our customers.

        Our opinion is directed to the Board of Directors of Company in connection with its consideration of the Agreement and Merger and does not constitute a recommendation
to any shareholder of Company as to how any such shareholder should vote at any meeting of shareholders called to consider and vote upon the adoption of the Agreement and
approval of the Merger. Our opinion is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to the holders of Company Common Stock and
does not address the underlying business decision of Company to engage in the Merger, the form or structure of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated in the
Agreement, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative transactions or business strategies that might exist for Company or the effect of any other
transaction in which Company might engage. We express no opinion as to the amount of compensation to be received in the Merger by any Company or Buyer officer, director or
employee, or any class of such persons, if any, relative to the amount of compensation to be received by any other shareholder. This opinion has been approved by Sandler
O'Neill's fairness opinion committee. This opinion may not be reproduced without Sandler O'Neill's prior written consent; provided, however, Sandler O'Neill will provide its
consent for the opinion to be included in regulatory filings to be completed in connection with the Merger.

        Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Company Common Stock.
