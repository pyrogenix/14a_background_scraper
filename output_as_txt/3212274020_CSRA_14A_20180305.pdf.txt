in cash, net of applicable withholding taxes and without interest (the “Offer Price”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to

Table of Contents

The Offer and withdrawal rights will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on April 2, 2018 (the “Expiration Time”, unless Purchaser has
extended or earlier terminated the period during which the Offer is open in accordance with the Merger Agreement (defined below), in which event,
“Expiration Time” will mean the latest time and date at which the Offer, as so extended by Purchaser, will expire).

The Offer is being made pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 9, 2018 (as it may be amended or supplemented from
time to time, the “Merger Agreement”), between CSRA, Parent and Purchaser. A summary of the material terms of the Merger Agreement is contained
in Section 13—“The Transaction Documents—The Merger Agreement” of the Offer to Purchase.

The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions, which are described further in
Section 15—“Conditions to the Offer” of the Offer to Purchase:
 

 
(i) the number of Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn, when added to the Shares owned by Parent and its

subsidiaries as of the Expiration Time, represents at least one Share more than 50% of the Shares on a fully diluted basis as of the Expiration
Time (without giving effect to the closing of the Top-Up Option (as defined below)) (the “Minimum Condition”);

 

 

(ii) the number of Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and its
subsidiaries as of the Expiration Time, represents, when added to the number of Shares authorized and available for issuance and sale by
CSRA to Purchaser in connection with an exercise of the Top-Up Option, one Share more than 90% of the Shares on a fully diluted basis
(assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Shares (as defined below));

 

 
(iii) the waiting period applicable to the Transactions under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the

rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the “HSR Act”) will have expired or been terminated, and any approvals, consent or
clearance required in connection with the Transactions will have been obtained, in each case, under or in relation to the HSR Act;

 

 
(iv) no governmental entity having jurisdiction over any party to the Merger Agreement will have issued any order (whether preliminary,

temporary or permanent) or taken any other action, in each case restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the
Transactions (defined below) nor will any law be in effect that makes consummation of the Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibited; and

 

 (v) the Merger Agreement having not been terminated in accordance with its terms.

The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all the conditions of the Offer, promptly (and, in
any event, no later than the first business day) after the Expiration Time, Purchaser will accept for payment all Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Time (the time of such acceptance, the “Offer Acceptance Time”).

On or after the Expiration Time, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Parent and Purchaser have an option (the “Top-Up Option”) to
purchase, at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, a number of newly issued Shares (the “Top-Up Shares”) equal to the lesser of (a) the number of
Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent and Purchaser at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one Share
more than 90% of the number of Shares on a fully diluted basis that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all Shares subject to
the Top-Up Option (the “Short-Form Merger Threshold”) or (b) the aggregate number of Shares that the Company is authorized to issue under its
articles of incorporation but that are not issued and outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued) at the time of exercise
of the Top-Up Option. If Parent, Purchaser and their affiliates own Shares representing at least the Short–Form Merger Threshold, including through the
exercise of the Top-Up Option, Parent will take all appropriate action to cause Purchaser to be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”)
without a vote of the stockholders of the Company in accordance with Nevada Revised Statutes (“NRS”), Chapter 92A, with the Company continuing as
the surviving corporation (the “Surviving Corporation”) in the Merger and thereby becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

Table of Contents

The Merger Agreement also provides that the Merger may be consummated regardless of whether the Offer is completed, but if the Offer is not
completed or if the Offer is completed but the Short-Form Merger Threshold is not met, the Merger will only be consummated after the stockholders of
the Company have adopted and approved the Merger Agreement at a meeting of stockholders. Upon the consummation of the Merger (the “Effective
Time”), the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. A copy of the Merger
Agreement is filed as Exhibit (e)(1) to this Schedule 14D-9 and is incorporated herein by reference.

As a result of the Merger, each outstanding Share (other than Shares (i) owned by Parent, Purchaser or any other direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, (iii) that are Dissenting Shares (defined below), if any, and (iv) in respect of stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units)
will be converted automatically into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, net of applicable withholding taxes and without interest. The Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are collectively referred to as the “Transactions.”

The Offer is made only for Shares and is not made for any Options, RSUs or PSUs (collectively, the “Company Equity Awards”). Options will
automatically be, immediately prior to the Effective Time, vested in full, cancelled and converted into the right to receive a lump-sum cash payment
equal to the excess of the Offer Price over the per Share exercise price or strike price, as applicable. PSUs will automatically be, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, vested (solely to the extent of their target levels), cancelled and converted into the right to receive a lump-sum cash payment equal to the
Offer Price plus the value of any dividend equivalents accumulated or retained by the Company in respect of the applicable PSU award. RSUs will
automatically be, immediately prior to the Effective Time, vested in full, cancelled and converted into the right to receive a lump-sum cash payment
equal to the Offer Price plus the value of any dividend equivalents accumulated or retained by the Company in respect of the applicable RSU award
(except in the case of RSUs awarded to employees in 2018, which will instead be converted into restricted stock units subject to the shares of common
stock of Parent and a right to cash payments of any dividend equivalents accumulated or retained by the Company prior to the Merger). All payments
with respect to Company Equity Awards will be paid by the Company without interest and net of any applicable withholding of taxes. As soon as
practicable after the date of the Merger Agreement, our Board of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock
Plan or the Director Stock Plan) is required to adopt resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of the Merger
Agreement with respect to the Company Equity Awards. See “Item 3. Past Contacts, Transactions, Negotiations and Agreements—Arrangements
between the Company and its Executive Officers, Directors and Affiliates—Treatment of Company Equity Awards,” which is incorporated by reference
herein.

According to the Offer to Purchase, the principal office address of Parent and Purchaser is located at 2941 Fairview Park Drive, Suite 100, Falls
Church, VA 22042, and their telephone number is (703) 876-3554.

For the reasons described below, our Board of Directors unanimously supports the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions and recommends
that the Company’s stockholders tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer.

 
Item 3. Past Contacts, Transactions, Negotiations and Agreements.

Conflicts of Interest

Except as set forth or incorporated by reference in this Schedule 14D-9, or otherwise incorporated herein by reference, to our knowledge, as of the
date of this Schedule 14D-9, there are no material agreements, arrangements or understandings, nor any actual or potential conflicts of interest between
(i) the Company or any of its affiliates, on the one hand and (ii) (x) any of its executive officers, directors or affiliates, or (y) Parent or Purchaser or any
of their respective executive officers, directors or affiliates, on the other hand.

Table of Contents

(a) Arrangements between the Company and its Executive Officers, Directors and Affiliates.

Our executive officers, directors and affiliates may be deemed to have interests in the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and in the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, which may be different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally. These interests
may create potential conflicts of interest. Our Board of Directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in reaching its
decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the Transactions (see “Item 4. The Solicitation or Recommendation—Reasons for Recommendation” of
this Schedule 14D-9). As described in more detail below, these interests include:
 

 
•  the accelerated vesting and payment in respect of Company Equity Awards, subject to certain exceptions with respect to vesting

acceleration;
 

 
•  the potential receipt of certain payments and benefits under individual employment agreements and severance policies upon certain types of

terminations of employment following the consummation of the Transactions, or in the case of Mr. Prior, prior to but in anticipation of the
consummation of the Transaction;

 

 •  receipt of certain payments pursuant to the terms of certain transaction bonus agreements;
 

 •  the accelerated payment of annual bonuses;
 

 •  the grant of 2018 RSU awards; and
 

 •  the entitlement to indemnification benefits in favor of directors and executive officers of the Company.

For further information with respect to the arrangements between the Company and certain executive officers, directors and affiliates described in
this Item 3, as well as other arrangements between the Company and its executive officers, directors and affiliates, please see the information under the
heading “Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of
Certain Officers” of the Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by the Company on August 10, 2017 and February 28, 2018, the Information Statement
attached as Annex III to this Schedule 14D-9, and the information under the heading “Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement” of the
Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on February 12, 2018, which excerpts are incorporated herein by reference as Exhibits (e)(14), (e)
(15) and (e)(16), respectively.

Outstanding Shares Held by Directors and Executive Officers

If our executive officers and directors who own Shares tender their Shares for purchase pursuant to the Offer, they will receive the same cash
consideration on the same terms and conditions as our other stockholders.

The following table sets forth (i) the number of Shares beneficially owned as of March 1, 2018, by each of our executive officers and directors
(which, for clarity, excludes Shares subject to issuance pursuant to granted and outstanding Options, RSUs and PSUs) and (ii) the aggregate cash
consideration that would be payable for such Shares pursuant to the Offer based on the Offer Price.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards

Options. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable,
will be cancelled as of such time. The holder of any such Option will be entitled only to the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of
(x) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the per Share exercise price (meaning, in the case of a stock appreciation right, the per Share “strike” or
base price) of such Option and (y) the number of Shares subject to such Option. The Company agreed that it will pay to holders of Options such cash
payment, if any, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time and in any case within 10 business days thereafter, without interest and less all applicable
taxes to be withheld in respect of such payment.

Performance Share Units. Under the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the Company Stock Plan, as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding PSU will become vested—solely to the extent of its “target” level as of such time—and cancelled in exchange for only the right
to receive from the Company an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price and the value of any dividend equivalents accumulated or retained by the
Company in respect of such PSU. The Company agreed that it will pay to holders of PSUs such cash payment as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time and in any case within 10 business days thereafter, without interest and less all applicable taxes to be withheld in respect of such payment.

Restricted Stock Units Granted to Employees Prior to 2018. Under the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the Company Stock Plan, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding RSU granted to an employee prior to 2018 will become fully vested and cancelled in
exchange for only the right to receive from the Company an amount equal to the Offer Price and the value of any dividend equivalents accumulated or
retained by the Company in respect of such RSU. The Company agreed that it will pay to holders of RSUs such cash payment as soon as practicable
after the Effective Time and in any case within 10 business days thereafter, without interest and less all applicable taxes to be withheld in respect of such
payment.

Table of Contents

Restricted Stock Units Granted to Employees in 2018. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, RSUs granted to employees during calendar year 2018
(“2018 RSUs”) will, following the Effective Time, be converted into (i) restricted stock units that are subject to shares of the common stock of Parent
(par value $0.001 per share) and (ii) a right to a cash payment of any dividend equivalents accumulated or retained by the Company prior to the
Effective Time, which cash payment shall be made as soon as practicable after the Effective Date and in any case within 10 business days thereafter,
without interest and less applicable taxes to be withheld in respect of such payment. Each RSU granted to an employee in 2018 will be converted into
restricted stock units of Parent by multiplying the number of Shares subject to each such RSU by the fraction determined by dividing (A) the Offer Price
of $40.75 per Share by (B) the average of the volume-weighted average price per share of Parent’s common stock trading on the New York Stock
Exchange (the “NYSE”) for each of the 20 consecutive business days ending on (and including) the date of the Merger (such converted award, the
“Converted RSUs”). The terms and conditions of such restricted stock units of Parent will, following the conversion of the RSUs granted to employees
in 2018, be the same as the terms and conditions that applied to the corresponding awards of such RSUs prior to the Effective Time. The Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will not, alone, give rise to either full or partial accelerated vesting of
Company RSUs awarded in 2018. The RSUs awarded in 2018 (as converted, if applicable) will, however, accelerate in full upon a termination of
employment for death, disability, or by the Company (or, following a change in control, the surviving corporation) without “cause” or due to an
employee’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the Company’s Executive Officer Employment Separation Policy, without regard
to whether such employee is covered by such policy).

Restricted Stock Units Granted to Non-Employee Directors. Under the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the Director Stock Plan, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding RSU awarded under the Director Stock Plan will become fully vested and cancelled in
exchange for only the right to receive from the Company an amount equal to the Offer Price and the value of any dividend equivalents accumulated or
retained by the Company in respect of such RSU. The Company agreed that it will pay to holders of RSUs such cash payment as soon as practicable
after the Effective Time and in any case within 10 business days thereafter, without interest.

With respect to any amount payable that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), to the extent that payment of such amount would otherwise cause the imposition of a tax or penalty under Section 409A
of the Code, such payment will instead be made at the earliest time permitted under the Merger Agreement and the terms of the corresponding award
that will not result in the imposition of such tax or penalty.

Since January 4, 2018 (the period commencing 60 days prior to the filing of this Schedule 14D-9), none of our executive officers or directors have
sold Shares received upon the exercise of Options, or the vesting or settlement of RSUs or PSUs, other than as provided in Item 6 of this
Schedule 14D-9. Our executive officers and directors may exercise their Options prior to the consummation of the Offer to the extent that such Options
are vested in accordance with their terms.

The table below sets forth, for each of our executive officers holding Options as of March 1, 2018 (i) the aggregate number of Shares subject to
such Options and (ii) the value of cash amounts payable in respect of such Options on a pre-tax basis as of the consummation of the Offer, calculated by
multiplying the excess of the Offer Price over the respective per-Share exercise prices of the applicable Options by the number of Shares subject to such
Options.

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company may, prior to the Effective Time, in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, grant each of our employees (including our executive officers) 2018 RSUs and each of our non-employee directors RSUs (i.e., awards in
respect of the Company’s fiscal 2019 annual equity program). On February 22, 2018, the Company granted the following number of 2018 RSUs: (i)
32,209 2018 RSUs to Mr. Keffer, (ii) 26,994 2018 RSUs to Mr. Haynes, (iii) 13,791 2018 RSUs to Mr. Reing, (iv) 19,632 2018 RSUs to Mr. Nedzbala,
(v) 17,669 2018 RSUs to Mr. Deutsch, (vi) 18,160 2018 RSUs to Ms. Palmer, (vii) 19,632 2018 RSUs to Mr. Batsakis, (viii) 7,362 2018 RSUs to
Mr. Dancy, (ix) 9,202 2018 RSUs to Mr. Marrone and (x) 3,558 2018 RSUs to Mr. Luebke. In addition, on February 26, 2018, the Company granted: (i)
62,380 2018 RSUs to Mr. Prior and (ii) 3,900 RSUs to each non-employee director (except for Ms. Killefer, who received a grant of 5,400 RSUs).

The table below sets forth, for each of our executive officers and directors holding RSUs as of March 1, 2018, (i) the aggregate number of Shares
subject to such RSUs that will be settled in connection with the transaction, (ii) the value of cash amounts payable in respect of such RSUs on a pre-tax
basis as of the consummation of the Transaction, calculated by multiplying the Offer Price by the number of Shares subject to such RSUs and (iii) the
value of cash dividend equivalents accumulated or retained by the Company in respect of such RSUs prior to the Effective Time. The amounts in the
table below do not include any value received in respect of Company Equity Awards held by the executive officer that are vested prior to the
consummation of the Transactions.

the exception of the cash payment of any dividend equivalents accumulated or retained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, the 2018

the common stock of Parent. For this reason, these 2018 RSUs were not included in the above table.

under the CSRA Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan.

Employment Arrangements

Each of our executive officers, other than Mr. Prior, is entitled to certain severance benefits pursuant to either the Executive Officer Employment
Separation Policy (the “Separation Policy”). In addition, Messrs. Prior and Luebke are entitled to severance benefits under an individual employment or
transaction incentive agreement, respectively, the terms of which are described below. The Transactions, if and when consummated, will constitute a
change in control under the applicable employment arrangement and will provide for the enhanced severance described in further detail below.

Employment Agreement. Mr. Prior entered into an employment agreement with the Company on December 20, 2016. If Mr. Prior’s employment
with the Company is terminated without “cause” (other than due to this death or disability) or due to his resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are
defined in the employment agreement), in each case within two years following a change in control transaction, Mr. Prior would receive, in addition to
accrued benefits, the following:
 

 
•  cash lump-sum payment equal to two and one-half times the sum of (i) Mr. Prior’s then-current annual base salary plus (ii) his target annual

bonus for the year of termination;
 

 

•  cash lump-sum payment equal to the annual bonus, based on actual performance, that would have been paid had he not been terminated,
prorated based on the number of months Mr. Prior was employed during the year of termination (rounded up to the next whole month),
which amount is payable at such time as the bonus is otherwise paid to similarly situated executives but no later than March 15 of the year
following the year of termination; and

 

 •  continued coverage for 30 months in the Company’s medical, dental and health plans at the Company’s expense.

If, prior to a change in control but at the request or suggestion of the buyer in contemplation of a change in control transaction, Mr. Prior’s
employment with the Company is terminated without cause (other than due to his

Table of Contents

death or disability) or due to his resignation for good reason, then within ten days after the change in control, Mr. Prior is entitled to, in addition to
continuation of the severance payable pursuant to his employment agreement (which, absent a change in control, is equal to 24 months of base salary
continuation, a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination of employment and continued coverage for 24 months in the Company’s medical, dental and
health plans, at active employee rates) a special payment equal to the excess of (i) the product of two and one-half times the sum of his base salary and
target annual bonus over (ii) two times his base salary, less applicable withholding and taxes.

Mr. Prior’s termination of employment with the Company is deemed for “good reason” if it occurs as a result of any of the following without
Mr. Prior’s express written consent: (i) a material decrease in Mr. Prior’s base salary (other than as part of an across the board reduction equally
applicable on a percentage basis to all executive officers of the Company); (ii) a relocation of Mr. Prior’s principal office by more than 50 miles, unless
the Company agrees to reimburse Mr. Prior for reasonable moving expenses and other customary relocation benefits incurred by him and his family with
respect to their relocation from their primary residence in connection with such a relocation, subject to customary documentation requirements; or (iii) a
material diminution in Mr. Prior’s position, duties, responsibilities or reporting lines. “Good reason” will not occur unless Mr. Prior provides a detailed
written notice to the Company of any fact or circumstance believed to constitute good reason within 30 days following the occurrence of such fact or
circumstance, the Company is given at least 30 days to cure such fact or circumstance, and Mr. Prior’s employment with the Company terminates
immediately following such 30 day cure period in the event the Company fails to cure such fact or circumstance.

In addition, to the extent that any payment to be made to Mr. Prior (a) constitutes a “parachute payment” under Section 280G of the Code and
(b) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then such payment will either be made (i) in full or (ii) in such lesser
amount that would result in no portion of such payment being subject to the Section 4999 excise tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts (taking into
account all applicable taxes), results in Mr. Prior’s receipt on an after-tax basis of the greatest amount of total compensation, notwithstanding that all or
some portion of the awards may be taxable under Section 4999. Such a provision, including as applied under any other plans, agreements or
arrangements to any executive officer or other vesting or payment events, is referred to in this Schedule 14D-9 as a “Golden Parachute Modified
Cutback.”

Payment of the amounts contemplated above are conditioned upon Mr. Prior’s execution (and non-revocation) of a release of claim against the
Company and its affiliates in substantially the form attached to his employment agreement and material compliance with applicable restrictive
covenants.

Separation Policy. Each of the Company’s executive officers, other than Mr. Prior, is covered by the Separation Policy, which provides certain
severance benefits in the event of a termination without “cause” (other than due to an executive officer’s death or disability) or, following a change in
control, a right to enhanced severance upon a termination without “cause” or a resignation for “good reason.” The entitlement to enhanced severance is
available to an executive officer whose employment is terminated (i) by the Company without cause (other than due to his or her due death or disability)
at any time within three years following the change in control or (ii) by the executive officer for good reason at any time within two years following the
change in control (any such termination, a “Qualifying Termination”).

If an executive officer’s employment is terminated as a result of a Qualifying Termination, he or she is entitled to the following payments and
benefits: (i) a one-time lump-sum payment equal to two times the sum of (a) the participant’s then-current annual base salary plus (b) the average of the
three most recent annual awards paid under the Company’s Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (annualizing any prior year bonus that was pro-rated
to account for an executive officer’s partial year of employment) and (ii) Company subsidized COBRA coverage for 24 months. To the extent that any
payments hereunder are subject to potential delay in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code, any such payments will be credited earnings
during such delay.

Table of Contents

An executive officer’s termination of employment with the Company is deemed for “good reason” if it occurs within six months of the occurrence
of any of the following events without the executive officer’s express written consent: (i) a substantial change in the nature, or diminution in the status,
of the executive officer’s duties or position from those in effect immediately prior to the change in control; (ii) a reduction by the Company in the
executive officer’s annual base salary or target total cash as in effect on the date of the change in control or as in effect thereafter if such compensation
has been increased and such increase was approved prior to the change in control; (iii) a failure to continue in effect any stock option or other equity-
based or non-equity based incentive compensation plan in effect immediately prior to the change in control, or a reduction in the executive officer’s
participation in any such plan, unless the executive officer is afforded the opportunity to participate in an alternative incentive compensation plan of
reasonably equivalent value; (iv) a failure to provide the participant the same number of paid vacation days per year available to him or her prior to the
change in control, or any material reduction or the elimination of any material benefit or perquisite enjoyed by the participant immediately prior to the
change in control; (v) any material breach by the Company of any provision of the Separation Policy or of any agreement entered into pursuant to the
Separation Policy or any stock or restricted stock agreement; (vi) conduct by the Company, against the executive officer’s volition, that would cause the
participant to commit fraudulent acts or would expose the participant to criminal liability; or (vii) any failure by the Company to obtain the assumption
of the Separation Policy or any agreement entered into pursuant to the Separation Policy by any successor or assign of the Company.

In addition, General Dynamics has agreed that the Company may amend agreements applicable to the executive officers to provide that payments
to be made in respect of the Separation Policy or otherwise will be subject to a Golden Parachute Modified Cutback, and such Golden Parachute
Modified Cutback was included in the award agreements for the 2018 RSUs.

Payment of the amounts contemplated above are conditioned upon an executive officer’s execution (and non-revocation) of a release of claim
against the Company and its affiliates and compliance with restrictive covenants consistent with the Company’s standards (generally a 12 month post-
termination non-competition covenant and a 24 month post-employment non-solicitation of employees and clients covenant).

Depending on their respective titles, roles and responsibilities, as applicable, our executive officers may have the right to assert good reason,
resign and collect severance benefits as described above, following the completion of the Merger.

Transaction Incentive Agreement. Mr. Luebke entered into a transaction incentive agreement with the Company on January 15, 2018, which
provides for a transaction bonus of $140,250 to be paid 30 days following the consummation of a transaction. In addition, the transaction incentive
agreement provides that if Mr. Luebke’s employment is terminated by the Company or the surviving corporation without “cause” (as defined below),
within 12 months following the Transactions, Mr. Luebke would receive a lump-sum payment equal to six-months base salary plus employer paid
contribution of his currently elected medical and dental benefits, subject to Mr. Luebke’s execution (and non-revocation) of a release. For purposes of
Mr. Luebke’s transaction incentive agreement, “cause” means Mr. Luebke engaging in any of the following: (i) the commission of any material act
constituting financial dishonesty against the Company or the surviving corporation; (ii) engagement in any other act of dishonesty, fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, moral turpitude, illegality or harassment; (iii) repeated willful or negligent non-performance of any material duty in connection with
his position; or (iv) any material breach of the covenants contained in his transaction incentive agreement.

Payment of Fiscal 2018 Bonus. General Dynamics has agreed that, to the extent that any participant in the Company’s 2018 annual cash bonus
plans (including any participation in such plans by our executive officers) has not been paid his or her 2018 annual bonus at the Effective Time, the
Company will pay any amounts due based on (i) actual Company performance and (ii) assuming a personal score for each participant of 1.0x. The
payment of such 2018 annual cash bonus will be on the earlier of (a) the business day immediately preceding the closing date of the Merger or
(b) May 15, 2018. The actual amounts of the 2018 annual cash bonuses will not be determined until close to the end of the Company’s 2018 fiscal year.

Table of Contents

We estimate that the aggregate amount payable to our executive officers pursuant to the terms of (i) Mr. Prior’s employment agreement, (ii) the
Separation Policy (excluding the value of accelerating Company Equity Awards) and (iii) pursuant to Mr. Luebke’s transaction incentive agreement,
would equal approximately $20,841,911, assuming that the consummation of the Transactions occurs on March 31, 2018, and that each executive officer
incurs a severance-qualifying termination of employment immediately following the consummation of the Transactions.

Treatment of Equity. As described in more detail in “—Treatment of Company Equity Awards,” all unvested Options, RSUs (except for 2018
RSUs) and PSUs (to the extent of their “target” levels) will vest as of immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan

As of March 1, 2018, Ms. Sullivan has an account balance of $938,236 in the CSRA Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the “NQDC
Plan”). This entire balance is scheduled for payment in a lump sum on May 11, 2018 (i.e., the six-month anniversary of her termination of employment
with the Company). Mr. Haynes has elected to defer a portion of his fiscal year 2018 bonus into the NQDC Plan. As of March 1, 2018, he has made no
other deferrals.

Golden Parachute Compensation—Quantification of Potential Payments to the Company’s Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Transactions

Background

This section sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information regarding the
compensation for each of our “named executive officers” whose compensation was disclosed in the Company’s Definitive Proxy Statement on
Schedule 14A, filed by the Company on June 27, 2017, that is based on or otherwise relates to the Offer and the Merger. This compensation is referred
to as “golden parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the Transaction-related
compensation payable to our named executive officers.

To the extent that any of our named executive officers’ compensation arrangements are described in “—Arrangements between the Company and
its Executive Officers, Directors and Affiliates—Employment Arrangements” of this Schedule 14D-9, they are incorporated herein by reference. The
amounts set forth in the table below, which represent an estimate of each named executive officer’s golden parachute compensation as of March 1, 2018
calculated in accordance with the SEC’s rules on disclosing golden parachute compensation, assume the following:
 

 •  consummation of the Transactions constitutes a change in control for purposes of the applicable compensation plan or agreement;
 

 •  the change in control was consummated on March 1, 2018, the latest practicable date prior to the filing of this Schedule 14D-9;
 

 •  each named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination immediately following the change in control; and
 

 
•  the value of the accelerated vesting of the named executive officers’ Company Equity Awards is calculated using the cash Offer Price of

$40.75 per Share.

Table of Contents

The amounts reported below are estimated based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including the assumptions described
above and elsewhere in this Schedule 14D-9. As a result, the transaction-related compensation, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may
materially differ from the amounts set forth below. The amounts in the table below do not include any value received in respect of Company Equity
Awards held by the named executive officer that are vested prior to the consummation of the Transactions.

(1) Under relevant SEC rules, we are required to provide information in this table with respect to our “named executive officers,” who are generally

the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the next three most highly compensated executive officers.
(2) The amount listed in this column represents the pre-tax value of the cash severance amount payable to the named executive officers, calculated as

follows:
 

 
(a) Mr. Prior’s cash severance is equal to the sum of (a) two and one-half times the sum of (i) base salary for the year of termination and

(ii) target annual incentive bonus, and (b) his pro-rated annual incentive bonus based upon actual performance. For purposes of this
calculation, we assumed termination on March 1, 2018 and target performance achievement.

 

 
(b) For the named executive officers other than Mr. Prior, cash severance is equal to two times the sum of (a) base salary for the year of

termination, and (b) the average annual bonus payment for the last three fiscal years (annualizing any prior year bonus that was pro-rated to
account for an executive officer’s partial year of employment).

All components of the cash amount are “double-trigger” (i.e., they are contingent upon a qualifying termination of employment that occurs within
two years (three years for a termination without cause for the named executive officers other than Mr. Prior) following the consummation of the
Transactions). As a condition of receiving the severance benefits, each named executive officer must execute a release of claims and comply with
restrictive covenants applicable to him or her.

The estimated amount of each component of the cash payment is set forth in the table below, with the target annual bonus for Mr. Prior and the
average annual bonus payment for the last three fiscal years for the other named executive officers, as well as a pro-rated bonus for the year of
termination based on actual achievement for Mr. Prior. Each of these amounts other than the pro-rated bonus will be multiplied by the applicable
multiple for the named executive officer.

represent the aggregate pre-tax amounts payable to each named executive officer pursuant to the Merger Agreement as a result of the Transactions,
on a “single-trigger” basis with respect to all unvested Options, RSUs and target PSUs held by such named executive officer as of March 1, 2018
the latest practicable date before the filing of this Schedule 14D-9, as well as on a “double-trigger” basis with respect to all unvested 2018 RSUs
held by such named executive officers as of such date upon a qualifying termination as described below. Such unvested Company Equity Awards
are valued based on the Offer Price of $40.75 per Share in respect of Shares subject to such Options, RSUs and target PSUs on a pre-tax basis at
the Effective Time. With respect to Options, this amount represents the value of cash amounts payable in respect of such Options, calculated on a
pre-tax basis by multiplying (i) the excess of the Offer Price over the respective per-Share exercise prices of the Options by (ii) the number of
unvested Shares subject to such Options. With respect to RSUs, this amount represents the value of cash amounts payable in respect of such RSUs
(and the value of any dividend equivalents accumulated or retained by the Company in respect of such RSUs (including the 2018 RSUs)),
calculated on a pre-tax basis by multiplying the Offer Price by the number of Shares subject to such RSUs. With respect to PSUs, this amount
represents the value of cash amounts payable in respect of such PSUs (and the value of any dividend equivalents accumulated or retained by the
Company in respect of such PSU), calculated on a pre-tax basis by multiplying the Offer Price by the number of Shares subject to such PSUs
assuming target performance achievement. As described in more detail in “—Arrangements between the Company and its Executive Officers,
Directors and Affiliates—Treatment of Company Equity Awards,” the Company is permitted to grant RSUs to its executive officers in 2018 (i.e.,
the 2018 RSUs, which represent the equity awards that would otherwise have been granted in respect of the fiscal year 2019 equity award
program) that will be converted into restricted stock units subject to the common stock of General Dynamics, on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable to such 2018 RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to a number of shares of common stock of General
Dynamics determined on the basis of an exchange ratio described in further detail above. The 2018 RSUs, which were granted on February 22,
2018 (February 26, 2018 for Mr. Prior) (as converted, if applicable) are, however, “double-trigger” and accelerate in full upon a termination of
employment for death, disability by the Company (or, following a change in control, the surviving corporation) without “cause” or due to an
employee’s resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the Separation Policy, without regard to whether such employee is covered
by the policy).

(4) Upon a qualifying termination of employment, the Company is required to provide continued coverage for 24 months (30 months for Mr. Prior) in
the Company’s medical, dental and health plans. Such benefits are “double-trigger” and are subject to the same conditions as the cash severance
payment described above.

Continuing Employee Benefits

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, from and after the Effective Time, General Dynamics is required to honor, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor, all employee plans and all employment, severance, change in control, bonus and other agreements and plans, and will assume any
employee plans that require or contemplate assumption by their terms by an acquirer or successor, but subject to any provisions thereof related to
termination or amendment of such agreements and plans.

General Dynamics will provide, or will cause to be provided, to each Company employee immediately before the Effective Time (including any of
our executive officers) who is employed by the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary thereof immediately following the Effective Time, other than an
employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries whose conditions of employment are governed by a collective bargaining agreement, the terms and
conditions of which will be respected by General Dynamics and the Surviving Corporation (which we refer to as “Continuing Employees”) for a period
of one year following the Effective Time, (i) base salary or wages that are no less favorable than the base salary or wages provided to each such
Continuing Employee by the Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) annual cash bonus or other short-term or long-
term cash or equity incentive compensation opportunities, as applicable, that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the annual cash bonus or other
short-term or long-term cash or

equity incentive compensation opportunities provided to each such Continuing Employee by the Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than those that would have been provided to each such Continuing Employee by the
Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iv) employee benefits (except to the extent otherwise covered by clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) above) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the employee benefits provided to each such Continuing Employee by the Company
and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

To the extent General Dynamics causes a Continuing Employee to cease to be eligible to participate in a Company benefit plan and instead
provides for such Continuing Employee to be eligible to participate in a benefit plan sponsored or maintained by General Dynamics or one of its
affiliates (all such plans, “Replacement Plans”), if such Replacement Plan is a group health plan, General Dynamics will credit (or cause to be credited)
such Continuing Employee, for the year during which such coverage under such Replacement Plan begins, with any deductibles and copayments already
incurred during such year under the comparable Company Benefit Plan. Moreover, General Dynamics or its affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) will (i) recognize (or cause the recognition of) each Continuing Employee’s years of service and level of seniority with the Company and
its subsidiaries (including service and seniority with any other employer that was recognized by the Company and its subsidiaries) for purposes of terms
of employment and eligibility, vesting and benefit determination (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or eligibility for
any retiree health or welfare benefit) under the Replacement Plans and (ii) cause each Replacement Plan to waive any preexisting condition exclusion or
restriction with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to a Continuing Employee to the extent such exclusion or restriction did
not apply with respect to such employee under the corresponding plan of the Company and its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time.

General Dynamics or its applicable affiliate will assume and honor all vacation and other paid time off days accrued or earned but not yet taken by
each Continuing Employee as of the Effective Time.

Section 16 Matters

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company is required to take all actions to the extent reasonably necessary to cause any dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) by each individual who is a Company director or officer, and who would otherwise be subject to Rule
16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), to be exempt under Exchange Act Rule 16b-3.

Potential for Future Arrangements

There have been preliminary discussions between General Dynamics Information Technology and certain executive officers of the Company
regarding post-closing employment arrangements and it is possible that additional members of our current management team will enter into new
employment or consulting arrangements with General Dynamics or its affiliates. Such arrangements may include the right to purchase or participate in
the equity of General Dynamics or its affiliates. Any such arrangements with our existing management team will not become effective until after the
Merger is completed, if at all. There can be no assurance that the applicable parties will reach an agreement on any terms, or at all.

To our knowledge, except for certain agreements described in this Schedule 14D-9, or in the documents incorporated by reference herein, between
the Company and its executive officers and directors, no employment, equity contribution or other agreement, arrangement or understanding between
any executive officer or director of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective affiliates or the Company, on the other
hand, existed as of the date of this Schedule 14D-9, and neither the Offer nor the Merger is conditioned upon any executive officer or director of the
Company entering into any such agreement, arrangement or understanding.

Director Compensation

Annual compensation for our non-employee directors for fiscal year 2018 is as follows:
 

 •  An annual cash retainer of $90,000 paid in cash; and
 

 
•  For each term of service after the initial term, an annual equity retainer with a grant date value of $160,000 ($220,000 for Ms. Killefer), paid

in the form of RSUs. The annual equity retainer will generally vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant (subject to continued service)
or the next annual meeting of stockholders.

In addition to the foregoing remuneration (i) our non-executive chair of the Board of Directors is entitled to receive an additional $80,000 annual
retainer paid in cash; (ii) chair of each of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance Committee is entitled to
receive an additional annual cash retainer of $30,000, $20,000 and $15,000, respectively; (iii) directors serving on each of the Audit Committee,
Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance Committee, other than the chairs of such committees, receive an additional annual cash
retainer of $10,000; and (iv) each director is entitled to receive an additional attendance fee of $2,500 for each meeting, project or assignment that
involves travel after the director has exceeded (a) an aggregate of eight Board meetings, projects and assignments or (b) an aggregate of committee
meetings, projects and assignments equal to six times the number of committees on which the director serves.

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company may, prior to the Effective Time, in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, grant each of our non-employee directors RSUs in respect of the annual equity program for fiscal year 2019. On February 26, 2018, the
Company granted Ms. Killefer 5,400 RSUs and each other non-employee director 3,900 RSUs. The terms of these awards are substantially consistent
with the terms described above, provided that such equity awards are subject to accelerated vesting as provided by the Merger Agreement and shall vest
upon the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the date of grant and (ii) the second annual meeting of shareholders following the date of grant, as
described in more detail in “—Arrangements between the Company and its Executive Officers, Directors and Affiliates—Treatment of Company Equity
Awards” of this Schedule 14D-9.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan

Each of Ms. Killefer and Mr. Alexander participate in the NQDC Plan, pursuant to which they have, respectively, elected to defer settlement of
7,700 and 6,200 restricted stock units previously granted to them in respect of their prior services. Ms. Killefer’s account balance will be settled in a
lump sum within 30 days of her termination of services (or, if earlier, her death). A portion of Mr. Alexander’s account balance will be settled in equal
installments over a period of five years following the termination of his services (or, if earlier, in a lump sum upon his death), with the remaining portion
to be distributed in annual installments from August 2022 to August 2027. In addition, each of Messrs. Ventling and Frantz have elected to defer the
receipt of shares in respect of RSUs they received in calendar year 2017 (which are scheduled to vest in 2018); as of March 1, 2018, neither has made
other deferrals.

Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance

The Merger Agreement provides that from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer or
director of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) in connection with any proceeding and any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities, costs, indemnification expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest,
assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom, subject to certain limitations more
fully described in the Merger Agreement. In addition, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent will (subject to the next sentence)
maintain in full effect the current directors’ and officers’ liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies covering the

Table of Contents

Indemnified Parties (but may substitute therefor other policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no
less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties so long as that substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with respect to matters occurring
on or before the Effective Time, but Parent is not required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premiums paid therefor prior to
the date of the Merger Agreement and will purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for that amount if the coverage described
would cost in excess of that amount. The Company may, on or prior to the Effective Time, purchase a tail policy with respect to acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified Parties in
their capacity as such in coverage and amount no greater than the policies currently in place so long as the total premiums paid would not exceed the
maximum aggregate amount of premiums contemplated to be paid under the previous sentence for such six-year period; provided that (i) the Company
will give Parent a consultation right in the selection of such “tail” policy and the Company will give good faith consideration to any comments made by
Parent with respect thereto, and (ii) if such tail policy is so purchased, Parent will be relieved of its obligations under the previous sentence.

In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that the Surviving Corporation will assume, without further action, at the Effective Time, all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing
in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Company’s organizational documents or the Company’s subsidiaries’ organizational documents
and that such rights will survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. In addition, from the Effective Time
through the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, subject to certain exceptions, the Surviving Corporation’s organizational documents and each
Company subsidiary’s organizational documents are required to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses, exculpation and limitations on liability of directors and officers than are set forth in the Company’s organizational documents and each
Company subsidiary’s organizational documents as in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement.

(b) Arrangements with Purchaser and Parent and their Affiliates.

Merger Agreement

On February 9, 2018, the Company, Parent and Purchaser entered into the Merger Agreement. The summary of the material provisions of the
Merger Agreement contained in Section 13 —“The Transaction Documents—The Merger Agreement” and the description of the conditions of the Offer
contained in Section 15 —“Conditions to the Offer” of the Offer to Purchase, which is filed as Exhibit (a)(1)(A) of Schedule TO, are incorporated herein
by reference. Such summary and description are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit (e)(1) hereto
and is incorporated herein by reference.

The Merger Agreement has been filed as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on February 12, 2018
to provide stockholders with information regarding its terms. The assertions embodied in the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the
Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, and may
be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by information in a confidential disclosure letter provided by
the Company to General Dynamics in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the
Merger Agreement were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as
material to stockholders, or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, the
representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement should not be relied on by any persons as characterizations of the actual state of facts and
circumstances about the Company, Parent or Purchaser at the time they were made or otherwise, and information in the Merger Agreement should be
considered in conjunction with the entirety of the factual disclosure about the Company in the Company’s public reports filed with the SEC. Information

representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in
the Company’s public disclosures. The Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but should instead be read in conjunction with the other information
regarding the Offer, the Merger, the Company, Parent, Purchaser, their respective affiliates and their respective businesses that are contained in, or
incorporated by reference into, the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO and related exhibits, including the Offer to Purchase, and this
solicitation/recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9, as well as in the Company’s other public filings.

Confidentiality Agreement

On December 13, 2017, the Company and Parent entered into a customary Confidentiality Agreement (the “Confidentiality Agreement”) in
connection with a possible transaction involving CSRA. Under the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and the Company agreed that, subject
to certain exceptions, Parent and its representatives would keep the “Evaluation Material” (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) strictly
confidential and would not (except as required by law, stock exchange rules or court order but only after compliance with the Confidentiality Agreement
or with the Company’s prior written consent) disclose any Confidential Information in any manner whatsoever, and would not use any Confidential
Information other than in connection with evaluating, negotiating or facilitating a possible transaction with the Company.

The Confidentiality Agreement includes a standstill provision for the benefit of the Company that expires on December 13, 2018, but which does
not restrict Parent from making any proposal for a possible transaction with the Company to directly or indirectly acquire all or a controlling portion of
the Company’s equity securities or all or substantially all of the Company’s assets but only if either (i) the Company or any of its representatives invites
Parent to do so in writing or (ii) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a transaction with a person or “group” of persons
(excluding the Company’s affiliates) involving the direct or indirect acquisition by such person or group of all or a controlling portion of the Company’s
equity securities or all or substantially all of the Company’s assets (whether by merger, consolidation, business combination, tender or exchange offer or
otherwise).

This summary and description of the Confidentiality Agreement is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
Confidentiality Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit (e)(2) hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

 
Item 4. The Solicitation or Recommendation.

On February 9, 2018, our Board of Directors unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement and the Transactions are advisable, fair to
and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) adopted, approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the Transactions,
(iii) approved the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (iv) authorized and approved the Top-Up Option
and the issuance of the Top-Up Shares in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, (v) directed that, if required by applicable law, the
Merger Agreement be submitted to the holders of Shares for approval and (vi) recommended that the holders of Shares accept the Offer and tender their
Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer and, if required by applicable law, approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and the Merger. Accordingly,
and for other reasons described in more detail below, our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that stockholders tender their Shares to
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer.

(i) Background of the Offer and the Merger

The Board of Directors, together with CSRA’s management and with the assistance of CSRA’s advisors, has periodically reviewed and assessed
CSRA’s operations, financial performance and competitive position in the context of CSRA’s long-term strategic goals and plans. The Board of
Directors regularly reviews potential opportunities to enhance stockholder value and engages in discussions as to whether the continued execution of

Table of Contents

CSRA’s strategy as a stand-alone company or the possible sale of CSRA to, or combination of CSRA with, a third party offered the best avenue to
enhance stockholder value, and the potential benefits and risks of any such transaction.

In early 2017, Mr. Lawrence B. Prior III, President and Chief Executive Officer of CSRA, and a member of senior management of a U.S.
government contracting company (referred to as “Company A”) met, at Company A’s request, to discuss Company A’s interest in a potential acquisition
of CSRA. Company A did not make any specific proposal at this initial meeting. On February 22, 2017, Company A and CSRA executed a
nondisclosure agreement to facilitate further discussion of a potential transaction between Company A and CSRA. On March 1, 2017, representatives of
Company A attended presentations by CSRA’s senior management.

On March 13, 2017, Company A submitted a letter to CSRA stating Company A’s interest in a potential business combination with CSRA.
Company A’s offer letter proposed a valuation range of approximately $34.00 to $37.00 per share of CSRA common stock and stated that Company A
would offer consideration consisting of a combination of stock and cash. With the assistance of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (“Paul,
Weiss”), CSRA’s legal counsel, and Evercore Group L.L.C. (“Evercore”), one of CSRA’s financial advisors, the Board of Directors carefully reviewed
and considered Company A’s proposal. Following their discussions, the Board of Directors determined that execution of CSRA’s strategic plan as a
standalone company was likely to provide greater value to stockholders than the proposed business combination upon the terms set forth in Company
A’s offer letter. Upon instruction from the Board of Directors, CSRA’s senior management contacted Company A and responded accordingly on
March 17, 2017.

On November 8, 2017, Mr. Prior met with a representative of Company A and a representative of Company A’s financial advisor. During the
course of that meeting, the representative of Company A and the representative of Company A’s financial advisor outlined potential improvements to
Company A’s March 13 proposal, including an increase in the proposed valuation to “up to $40” per share of CSRA common stock.

In early November 2017, a representative of another U.S. government contracting company (referred to as “Company B”) contacted Mr. Prior to
arrange a meeting between Company B and CSRA to discuss Company B’s interest in pursuing a potential business combination with CSRA. On
November 13, 2017, the Chief Executive Officer of Company B and Mr. Prior had an introductory meeting.

On November 17, 2017, a representative of Evercore, acting on behalf of CSRA, contacted a member of senior management of General Dynamics
to discuss whether General Dynamics would be interested in a potential business combination transaction involving CSRA.

On November 20, 2017, Company B and CSRA executed a nondisclosure agreement to facilitate further discussion.

Also on November 20, 2017, a representative of Evercore, acting as CSRA’s financial advisor, contacted Ms. Phebe N. Novakovic, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of General Dynamics, to follow up on the prior discussion and determine whether General Dynamics might be interested in
evaluating a potential acquisition of CSRA.

On November 21, 2017, Ms. Novakovic contacted Evercore in response to the November 20, 2017 inquiry and advised that General Dynamics
would make an internal assessment of the potential acquisition opportunity and respond as appropriate.

On November 30, 2017, representatives of Company B and representatives of CSRA met to discuss Company B’s interest in a potential
acquisition of CSRA.

On December 8, 2017, a representative of Company B called Mr. Prior to express interest in Company B’s acquisition of all of the outstanding
shares of CSRA common stock for a mix of cash and stock consideration

with an implied valuation of approximately $31.93 per share of CSRA’s common stock based on the closing price of CSRA common stock and
Company B common stock on December 7, 2017. Following the call, a representative of the financial advisor to Company B delivered a letter to
Evercore, confirming the terms of Company B’s offer.

Also on December 8, 2017, a representative of Stone Key Group LLC (“Stone Key”), financial advisor to General Dynamics, contacted CSRA on
behalf of General Dynamics to express General Dynamics’ interest in initiating a discussion of the terms under which General Dynamics might be
willing to engage in a dialogue regarding the potential acquisition of CSRA.

On December 9, 2017, Ms. Novakovic and Mr. Prior discussed General Dynamics’ potential interest in acquiring all of the outstanding stock of
CSRA. On December 13, 2017, General Dynamics and CSRA executed a nondisclosure agreement to facilitate further discussion regarding a potential
transaction.

On December 13, 2017, Company A submitted a letter containing an updated proposal to CSRA. Company A’s letter proposed a valuation range
of $38.00 to $40.00 per share of CSRA’s common stock and stated that Company A would again offer consideration consisting of a combination of a
fixed amount of cash consideration and stock consideration at a fixed exchange ratio.

On December 13 and 14, 2017, the Board of Directors held regularly scheduled meetings in Bossier City, Louisiana, Members of CSRA’s senior
management and representatives of Evercore and representatives of Paul, Weiss also attended portions of the meetings. During the December 13
meeting, Mr. Prior led a discussion of CSRA’s financial model and the financial aspects of CSRA’s strategic plan. Representatives of Evercore provided
the Board of Directors with a summary of the offers received from Company A and Company B and an update on the status of discussions with General
Dynamics, Company A and Company B. A representative of Paul, Weiss then reviewed with CSRA’s Board of Directors its fiduciary duties in
considering a merger of CSRA with a third party and in connection with the evaluation of the offers from Company A and Company B and a potential
offer from General Dynamics.

During the remainder of the December 13–14 meetings, the Board of Directors continued its review and discussion with CSRA’s senior
management of a variety of topics relating to CSRA’s strategic direction, including strategic priorities in certain key segments of CSRA’s business, the
competitive landscape for CSRA’s business, macro trends and challenges, CSRA’s financial performance, growth initiatives, potential M&A activity and
alternatives for the creation of stockholder value.

To enhance efficiency, at the December 13–14, 2017 meetings, CSRA’s Board of Directors decided to create a special committee (the
“Coordination Committee”) to coordinate and oversee CSRA’s interactions with Company A, Company B, and General Dynamics, as well as CSRA’s
strategic alternatives more generally. The Coordination Committee was comprised of Nancy Killefer, Craig Martin, Billie I. Williamson and Mark A.
Frantz. These directors were chosen for their extensive experience in corporate finance and strategic development, as well as their knowledge of CSRA
and its industry.

On December 18, 2017, members of management of General Dynamics and members of management of CSRA, and representatives of Stone Key,
representatives of Evercore and representatives of Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. (“Macquarie Capital”), one of CSRA’s financial advisors, met to
discuss the potential acquisition by General Dynamics of CSRA and the potential combination of CSRA’s business with General Dynamics’ information
technology business.

Later in the day on December 18, 2017, the Coordination Committee held a special telephonic meeting, which was attended by all members of the
Coordination Committee, to discuss the status of CSRA’s interactions with Company A, Company B and General Dynamics, as well as to discuss other
potential counterparties. Members of CSRA’s senior management and representatives of Paul, Weiss also participated.

On January 3, 2018, Ms. Novakovic informed Mr. Prior by telephone that General Dynamics would be interested in pursuing an acquisition of
CSRA at a price of between $39.50 and $40.00 per share of CSRA common stock, but due to General Dynamics’ concerns regarding CSRA’s ongoing
litigation with the State of Maryland regarding the Medicaid Enterprise Restructuring Project contract (the “Maryland Litigation”), it was electing not to
pursue discussions regarding a potential transaction unless CSRA was able to resolve such dispute.

On January 5, 2018, the Coordination Committee held a special telephonic meeting, which was attended by all members of the Coordination
Committee, as well as other members of the Board of Directors. Members of CSRA’s senior management and representatives of Paul, Weiss also
participated. Representatives of Paul, Weiss described the current status of discussions with each of the three potential buyers. Mr. Prior then led the
Coordination Committee in a discussion of General Dynamics’ request with respect to the Maryland Litigation. The Coordination Committee instructed
senior management and Paul, Weiss to engage with the State of Maryland regarding a potential resolution of the Maryland Litigation, solely to preserve
flexibility with respect to potential counterparties.

On or about January 8, 2018, Mr. Prior contacted Ms. Novakovic by telephone and indicated that CSRA was exploring the possibility of a
potential resolution of the Maryland Litigation.

On January 9, 2018, CSRA received a revised offer from Company B reflecting a proposed valuation of $40.00 per share of CSRA’s common
stock, consisting of a combination of stock and cash. Later that day, the Chief Executive Officer of Company B and Mr. Prior participated in a call to
discuss Company B’s revised offer.

On January 10, 2018, CSRA received a revised offer from Company A. The offer letter proposed an increased amount of cash consideration and
stock consideration at a fixed exchange ratio, with an implied valuation of $39.00 per share based on the closing price of Company A common stock on
January 9, 2018.

On January 12, 2018, Ms. Novakovic contacted Mr. Prior by telephone and indicated that General Dynamics would be interested in pursuing an
acquisition of CSRA, and Ms. Novakovic subsequently sent a letter to Mr. Prior confirming General Dynamics’ interest in the potential acquisition of
CSRA for $40.00 per share, subject to settlement of the Maryland Litigation, with a corresponding adjustment in the proposed purchase price to account
for the financial impact associated with settling the Maryland Litigation, among other conditions. In this letter, it was noted that General Dynamics was
proposing an all cash transaction and was prepared to come to terms expeditiously.

Later in the day on January 12, 2018, the Coordination Committee held a special telephonic meeting, which was attended by all members of the

management provided the Coordination Committee with an update on the status of discussions with the State of Maryland. After discussion with the
advisors and members of the Company’s senior management, the Coordination Committee instructed representatives of Evercore, representatives of
Macquarie Capital and representatives of Paul, Weiss to distribute a draft merger agreement to each of the three bidders.

Following the Coordination Committee meeting, on January 12, 2018, a draft merger agreement was distributed to outside legal counsels of
Company A and Company B. On January 13, 2018, a draft merger agreement was distributed to General Dynamics through Stone Key.

On January 15, 2018, CSRA formally engaged Evercore to act as one of its financial advisors in connection with CSRA’s review of a potential
transaction.

On January 18, 2018, a representative of Company B’s outside legal counsel sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Paul, Weiss on behalf
of Company B. On the next day, a representative of Company A’s outside legal counsel sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Paul, Weiss on
behalf of Company A.

On January 19, 2018, the Coordination Committee held a special telephonic meeting, which was attended by all members of the Coordination
Committee, as well as other members of the Board of Directors. Members of CSRA’s senior management and representatives of Paul, Weiss also
participated. During this meeting, representatives of Paul, Weiss compared the terms of the revised merger agreement drafts submitted by Company A
and Company B and senior management updated the Coordination Committee on the status of discussions with the State of Maryland.

On January 22, 2018, Paul, Weiss sent revised drafts of the merger agreement to each of outside legal counsel to Company A and outside legal
counsel to Company B on behalf of CSRA.

On or about January 23, 2018, a member of management of CSRA informed a member of management of General Dynamics that CSRA
management believed that it was close to having the option to resolve the Maryland Litigation.

On January 24, 2018, outside legal counsel to Company A sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Paul, Weiss on behalf of Company A.

On January 25, 2018, CSRA received an updated offer letter from Company A. The letter proposed a fixed amount of cash consideration and a
fixed exchange ratio for stock consideration based on the volume weighted average price (“VWAP”) of Company A’s common stock for the ten
(10) consecutive trading days preceding the signing date, with an implied valuation of $40.00 per share based on the VWAP of Company A’s common
stock for the ten (10) consecutive trading days preceding the date of the offer letter.

On January 25, 2018, the Board of Directors met in Dulles, Virginia, with members of CSRA’s senior management and representatives of Wolf
Den Associates, LLC (“Wolf Den”), CSRA’s due diligence advisors, with Paul, Weiss, Evercore and Macquarie Capital participating, to discuss and
consider the proposals made by Company A, Company B and General Dynamics.

The Board of Directors engaged in an extensive discussion regarding CSRA’s review of its strategic alternatives. During this meeting,
representatives of Evercore and representatives of Macquarie Capital reviewed financial aspects of the offers from General Dynamics, Company A and
Company B, representatives of Paul, Weiss compared the terms of the revised merger agreement drafts submitted by Company A and Company B and
Wolf Den reviewed the results of their due diligence findings. The Board of Directors considered the types and amounts of consideration offered by the
potential buyers, the perceived deal certainty, including that each of the transactions proposed by Company A and Company B would require the
approval of the potential buyer’s stockholders and, in each case, the potential buyer would have the ability to terminate the merger agreement for a
superior transaction proposal, the market risk associated with the proposals and the potential remedies available to the Company if the potential buyers
were unable to complete a transaction. After discussion, the Board of Directors determined that, because the prices offered by General Dynamics,
Company A and Company B were so close in value, the advisors should promptly contact each of the three bidders and seek to obtain enhanced offers.

Members of the Company’s senior management then led the Board of Directors in a discussion of the merger opportunities with Company A and
Company B, including a review of each party’s business offerings and capabilities, possible synergies and certain financial, regulatory and timing
considerations relating to a potential combination with either Company A or Company B.

Company A and Company B, and, as directed by the Board of Directors, requested that each submit best and final offer price by the evening of
February 1, 2018 for the Board of Directors’ consideration. Concurrently, representatives of Paul, Weiss contacted the respective outside legal counsels
to Company A and Company B and requested that each of them submit a revised draft of the merger agreement as part of the improved offer. The
representatives of Paul, Weiss highlighted specific provisions in each potential buyer’s mark-up of the merger agreement that should be improved.

Also on January 26, 2018, representatives of Evercore and representatives of Macquarie Capital contacted Stone Key and requested that General
Dynamics submit a further revised merger agreement and offer by February 2, 2018 for the Board of Directors’ consideration.

On January 26, 2018, Jenner & Block LLP (“Jenner & Block”), General Dynamics’ outside legal counsel, sent a revised draft of the merger
agreement to Paul, Weiss on behalf of General Dynamics.

On January 29, 2018, Paul, Weiss sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Jenner & Block on behalf of CSRA. Over the course of the
following eleven (11) days, representatives of Paul, Weiss and representatives of Jenner & Block and members of management of each of CSRA and
General Dynamics continued to negotiate the terms of the merger agreement and other transaction documents.

On January 30, 2018, outside legal counsel to Company A sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Paul, Weiss on behalf of Company A.
Also on January 30, 2018, outside legal counsel to Company B sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Paul, Weiss on behalf of Company B.

During the month of January 2018, each of General Dynamics, Company A and Company B was provided with access to an electronic data room
that contained non-public information regarding CSRA, and representatives of each of these parties attended presentations by CSRA’s senior
management. Additionally, CSRA was provided with access to electronic data rooms that contained non-public information regarding each of Company
A and Company B, respectively, and representatives of CSRA attended presentations by the senior management of each of these parties. Throughout the
month of January and the first two weeks of February, each of General Dynamics, Company A and Company B conducted due diligence investigations
of CSRA and CSRA conducted due diligence investigations of Company A and Company B, each of which included the review of numerous documents
and participation in numerous calls and meetings with the party’s senior management and with representatives of the party’s legal counsel and financial
advisors.

On February 1, 2018, CSRA received an updated offer letter from Company B. The letter proposed a fixed amount of cash consideration and stock
consideration at a fixed exchange ratio, with an implied valuation of $42.00 per share based on the closing price of Company B’s common stock on the
date immediately prior to the offer letter.

Also on February 1, 2018, a representative of Company A submitted a revised written proposal, pursuant to which Company A increased its
proposed valuation of CSRA’s common stock to $41.00 per share. The letter proposed the same fixed amount of cash consideration as in Company A’s
prior proposal and a fixed exchange ratio for stock consideration based on the VWAP of Company A’s common stock for the ten (10) consecutive
trading days preceding the signing date.

On February 2, 2018, Ms. Novakovic communicated with Mr. Prior and informed him that General Dynamics was offering to acquire CSRA at a
price of $40.50 per share, payable in cash. This offer was subsequently confirmed in a letter of the same date from Ms. Novakovic to Mr. Prior.

Also on February 2, 2018, the Board of Directors held a special telephonic meeting, which was attended by all members of the Board of Directors.

Weiss, representatives of Evercore and representatives of Macquarie Capital also participated. A member of CSRA’s senior management informed the
Board of Directors of the status of discussions with the State of Maryland and informed the Board of Directors of the amount of the settlement offer
proposed by the State of Maryland with respect to the Maryland Litigation. Representatives of Evercore, representatives of Macquarie Capital and
representatives of Paul, Weiss then reviewed with the Board of Directors the material terms of the latest proposals that had been received from General
Dynamics, Company A and Company B. The Board of Directors compared the all-cash $40.50 per share proposal from General Dynamics and the
mixed consideration proposals from Company A and Company B, valued at $41.00 and $42.00, respectively, as indicated in the proposals. At the
request of the Board of Directors, representatives of Evercore and representatives of Macquarie Capital then led a discussion with the Board of Directors
to assist the Board of Directors in comparing the proposals from General Dynamics, Company A and Company B, including the type of consideration.
Representatives of Evercore and representatives of Macquarie Capital also noted that the price of Company A and Company B common stock had
decreased since the time at which each party’s proposal had been made, resulting in a decrease in the then current value of each of Company A’s and
Company B’s proposal. The Board of Directors, with the assistance of the advisors, compared the risks associated with the proposals from General
Dynamics, Company A and Company B, including the provisions in the respective merger agreements applicable to regulatory matters, the risk that a
potential buyer’s financing becomes unavailable and the remedies available to the Company in that circumstance, as well as the market risk relating to
the portion of the consideration Company A and Company B proposed to pay in stock. After discussion of these and other factors, and taking into
account the considerations discussed with Evercore and Macquarie Capital, the Board of Directors determined that the $40.50 all-cash proposal from
General Dynamics was superior to the Company’s other alternatives. The Board of Directors, with the assistance of the advisors, then considered
whether it would be beneficial to seek further price improvements from the potential buyers and discussed the potential benefits and risks of doing so,
including the risk of losing the current offer from General Dynamics and, in the case of the offers from Company A and Company B, the desire to
safeguard the value of the potential stock consideration payable at closing. The Board of Directors also discussed that price increases from Company A
and Company B may not be desirable for CSRA’s stockholders as additional cash consideration would require additional leverage that could place
additional strain on the post-closing combined company, of which the current CSRA stockholders would own a majority of the stock outstanding, and
additional stock consideration could make it more difficult to obtain the approval of the stockholders of the potential buyer. After these discussions, the
Board of Directors instructed senior management to work with Paul, Weiss to be in a position to resolve the Maryland Litigation in advance of the
signing of a merger agreement with General Dynamics. The Board of Directors then instructed senior management to work with Evercore, Macquarie
Capital and Paul, Weiss to inform General Dynamics that CSRA expected the Maryland Litigation to be in a position to be resolved in advance of the
signing of a merger agreement. The Board of Directors further instructed senior management and the advisors to seek a price increase from General
Dynamics and to continue to negotiate with General Dynamics regarding certain key terms and to report back to the Board of Directors.

On February 3, 2018, Mr. Prior communicated with Stone Key to indicate that General Dynamics would need to increase the value of its offer in
order to proceed with further discussions regarding an acquisition of CSRA. Later on February 3, 2018, Ms. Novakovic informed Mr. Prior that General
Dynamics was willing to increase its offer price to $40.75 per share, payable in cash. Ms. Novakovic indicated in the course of this conversation that this
represented General Dynamic’s best and final offer.

On February 7, 2018, representatives of the financial advisor to Company A informed representatives of Evercore and representatives of
Macquarie Capital that Company A remained interested in a potential transaction.

On February 8, 2018, Company A sent a letter to Mr. Prior confirming that its February 1 offer remained valid.

Also on February 8, 2018, Company B contacted Mr. Prior to indicate its continued interest in a potential acquisition of CSRA.

Also on February 8, 2018, Ms. Novakovic called Mr. Prior and informed Mr. Prior that the board of directors of General Dynamics had approved
the potential transaction with CSRA, subject to the resolution of the Maryland Litigation.

Later on the evening of February 8, 2018, the Board of Directors held a special meeting, attended by all of the members of the Board of Directors.
During this meeting, representatives of Evercore and representatives of Macquarie Capital, reviewed financial aspects of the offers from Company A,
Company B and General Dynamics. Representatives of Paul, Weiss compared the terms of the revised merger agreement drafts submitted by the
respective bidders and reviewed in detail the provisions of the proposed merger agreement and other transaction documents relating to General
Dynamics. The Board of Directors considered the respective forms of consideration offered by the potential buyers, the perceived deal certainty and
market risk associated with the proposals and the potential remedies available to CSRA if the potential buyers were unable to complete a transaction.
Representatives of Evercore and representatives of Macquarie Capital noted that although the public market price of Company A common stock and
Company B common stock could increase or decrease between the signing and closing of a transaction, both had continued to decline since the Board of
Directors’ February 2 meeting, resulting in a further decrease in the then current value of each party’s proposal, based on the closing price of Company
A common stock and Company B common stock on February 8, 2018 to $40.58 and $38.67, respectively.

On February 9, 2018, CSRA and the State of Maryland entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the Maryland Litigation.

Also on February 9, 2018, the Board of Directors reconvened to consider further the proposed transaction. Members of CSRA’s senior
management and representatives of Paul, Weiss, representatives of Evercore and representatives of Macquarie Capital also participated. Paul, Weiss then
updated the Board of Directors on changes to the proposed merger agreement and other transaction documents related to General Dynamics.
Representatives of each of Evercore and Macquarie Capital then reviewed and discussed its respective financial analyses of the proposed transaction
with General Dynamics. Thereafter, at the request of the Board of Directors, Evercore rendered its oral opinion to the Board of Directors (which was
subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Evercore’s written opinion addressed to the Board of Directors, dated as of February 9, 2018), as to, as
of such date, the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of CSRA common stock other than excluded holders, of the proposed
consideration to be received by such holders in the tender offer or the merger pursuant to the merger agreement. Macquarie Capital also rendered its oral
opinion to the Board of Directors (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Macquarie Capital’s written opinion addressed to the
Board of Directors, dated as of February 9, 2018), as to, as of such date, the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of shares of CSRA
common stock other than excluded holders, of the proposed consideration to be received by such holders in the tender offer and/or the merger pursuant
to the merger agreement.

After discussing potential reasons for and against the proposed merger described above and in the section entitled “—Reasons for
Recommendation” beginning on page 27, CSRA’s Board of Directors unanimously approved and declared advisable the merger agreement, the merger
and all of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; declared that it is in the best interests of CSRA and its stockholders that CSRA
enter into the merger agreement and consummate the merger and all of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and recommended
that the stockholders of CSRA tender their shares pursuant to the tender offer by the subsidiary of General Dynamics to purchase the outstanding shares
of CSRA and, if applicable, vote in favor of the approval of the merger and the merger agreement.

Representatives of Paul, Weiss then reviewed with CSRA’s Board of Directors the terms of, and considerations with respect to, a forum selection
bylaw, including the scope of forum selection bylaws, the enforceability of forum selection bylaws and the potential benefits of adopting a forum
selection bylaw. CSRA’s

Board of Directors then approved an amendment of CSRA’s bylaws to provide that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for certain legal actions involving CSRA will be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).

Also on February 9, 2018, a member of management of CSRA reported to a member of management of General Dynamics that, at a special
meeting held on that date, the Board of Directors met to consider the proposed transaction and approved the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby. On that same day, representatives of Paul, Weiss and representatives of Jenner & Block and members of management of each of
CSRA and General Dynamics finalized the merger agreement and other transaction documents, and thereafter the merger agreement was executed and
delivered by the parties. The merger agreement provided for the commencement of a tender offer for all of the shares of CSRA common stock at a price
per share of $40.75, subject to customary conditions.

Subsequent to the execution of the merger agreement with General Dynamics and in advance of public announcement of the transaction, each of
Company A and Company B sought to engage with CSRA regarding negotiation of a potential transaction. In accordance with the terms of the merger
agreement, CSRA did not engage with Company A and Company B.

Prior to the opening of markets in the United States on February 12, 2018, CSRA and General Dynamics issued a joint press release announcing
the signing of the merger agreement and the forthcoming commencement of the tender offer.

Later in the day on February 12, 2018, outside legal counsel to Company A and outside legal counsel to Company B informed Paul, Weiss that
Company A and Company B, respectively, had withdrawn their offers.

(ii) Reasons for Recommendation

Our Board of Directors consulted with senior management of the Company regarding, among other things, the Company’s industry and its
business and prospects as an independent company. In the course of reaching its unanimous determination, our Board of Directors consulted with its
legal advisors regarding the Board of Directors’ legal duties, the terms of the Merger Agreement and related issues, consulted with its financial advisors
regarding certain financial aspects of the Offer and the Merger and carefully considered the following reasons that weighed positively in favor of its
decision, among others and not necessarily in order of relative importance:
 

 

•  Premium to Market Price. Our Board of Directors considered the current and historical market prices of the Shares, including the market
performance of the Shares relative to those of other participants in the Company’s industry and general market indices, and the fact that the
Offer Price represents a compelling premium to historical market prices of the Shares, including (1) a 33.4% premium to the closing price of
the Shares on February 6, 2018; (2) a 27.2% premium to the VWAP for the Shares over the 30-day period ended February 6, 2018; (3) a
31.0% premium to the VWAP for the Shares over the 60-day period ended February 6, 2018; (4) a 35.3% premium to the VWAP for the
Shares over the 90-day period ended February 6, 2018; and (5) a 21.0% and 48.0% premium to the highest and lowest, respectively, trading
prices for the Shares over the 52-week period ended February 6, 2018.

 

 
•  Certainty of Value. Our Board of Directors considered that the Offer Price is all cash, so that the Transactions provide certainty, immediate

value and liquidity to our stockholders for their Shares, especially when viewed against any internal or external risks and uncertainties
associated with the Company’s standalone strategy.

 

 
•  No Financing Condition. The Board of Directors considered the fact that Parent and Purchaser would have sufficient cash resources to pay

the amounts required to be paid under the Merger Agreement and that the Transactions are not subject to a financing condition.

9/28/2019 SC 14D9

Table of Contents

 

•  The Company’s Operating and Financial Condition; Prospects of the Company. Our Board of Directors considered the Company’s business,
financial condition and results of operations. Our Board of Directors considered, among other factors, that the holders of the Shares would
continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties of the Company if it remained independent. These risks and uncertainties included risks
relating to reduced spending levels and changing budget priorities of the Company’s largest customer, the U.S. government; the Company’s
ability to maintain strong relationships with the U.S. government and other contractors and subcontractors; possible delays or overturning of
the Company’s U.S. government contract awards due to bid protests; failure of the Company’s customers to fund contracts or exercise their
options to extend contracts, or the Company’s inability to execute awarded contracts successfully; and other risks and uncertainties,
including the risk factors set forth in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 and subsequent
quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

 

 
•  Likelihood and Speed of Consummation. Our Board of Directors considered the likelihood of completion of the Transactions to be high,

particularly in light of the terms of the Merger Agreement and the closing conditions to the Offer and the Merger, including:
 

 •  the conditions to the Offer and the Merger being specific and limited;
 

 •  the size and financial strength of Parent and its ability to fund the Offer Price with cash;
 

 •  the likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals;
 

 
•  the remedy of specific performance available to the Company under the Merger Agreement in the event of breaches by Parent and

Purchaser;
 

 
•  the fact that the Offer and the Merger are not subject to the conditionality and execution risk of any required approval by Parent’s

stockholders; and
 

 •  the fact that the termination date under the Merger Agreement allows for sufficient time to consummate the Offer and the Merger.
 

 

•  Flexibility Provided by the Structure of the Transaction. The structure of the transaction as a two-step transaction potentially enables the
Company’s stockholders to receive the Offer Price pursuant to the Offer in a relatively short time frame (and potentially reduces the
uncertainty during the pendency of the transaction), followed by the Merger in which stockholders who do not tender their Shares into the
Offer will receive the same cash price as is paid pursuant to the Offer. In addition, the Merger Agreement permits the use of a one-step
transaction, with a merger following the approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders, which may in certain
circumstances be more expedient than the two-step transaction. If a sufficient number of Shares are tendered into the Offer, Purchaser will
be able, subject to certain conditions, to exercise the Top-Up Option to purchase additional Shares sufficient to cause Purchaser to own one
more than 90% of the then-outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis, which would permit Purchaser to close the Merger (as a merger of
parent into subsidiary under Nevada law) more quickly than a one-step merger requiring the approval of the Company’s stockholders.

 

 
•  Competitive Process. Our Board of Directors considered the fact that the Company received proposals from and engaged in significant

arm’s-length negotiations with three parties that it believed were logical potential buyers, including Parent. See Item 4. “The Solicitation or
Recommendation—Background of the Offer and the Merger.”

 

 

•  Negotiation Process. Our Board of Directors considered the enhancements that the Company and its advisors were able to obtain as a result
of robust arm’s-length negotiations with Parent, including the increases in the Offer Price proposed by Parent from the time of its initial
indication of interest to the end of the negotiations, and inclusion of provisions in the Merger Agreement that increase the likelihood of
completing the Offer and consummating the Merger.

Table of Contents

 

•  Best Strategic Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value. Our Board of Directors determined, after a thorough review of strategic
alternatives and discussions with our management and its financial and legal advisors, that the Offer Price is more favorable to the
Company’s stockholders than the potential value that might have resulted from other strategic options available, including, but not limited
to, remaining a standalone public company.

 

 
•  Opportunity to Receive Unsolicited Proposals, Change Recommendation or Terminate the Transactions in Order to Accept a Superior

Proposal. Our Board of Directors considered the terms of the Merger Agreement permitting the Company to receive unsolicited proposals,
and the other terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including:

 

 
•  that the Company may, subject to certain conditions, furnish any information and reasonable access to third parties making such a

proposal and participate or engage in negotiations or discussions with such third parties regarding unsolicited proposals that are
made prior to the time that the Offer is consummated;

 

 

•  the provisions of the Merger Agreement allowing our Board of Directors in certain circumstances to terminate the Merger
Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to an unsolicited superior proposal, subject to payment of a
termination fee of $204 million, which amount the directors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and taking into
account the range of such termination fees in similar transactions, and the unlikelihood that a fee of such size would be a meaningful
deterrent to other acquisition proposals; and

 

 

•  its ability under the Merger Agreement to withdraw or modify its recommendation that the Company’s stockholders tender their
Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer in certain circumstances, including in connection with a superior proposal or an event,
occurrence or fact occurring or arising after the date of the Merger Agreement that was not known to our Board of Directors as of the
date of the Merger Agreement.

 

 
•  Other Terms of the Merger Agreement. Our Board of Directors considered other terms of the Merger Agreement, as more fully described in

Section 13—“The Transaction Documents—The Merger Agreement” of the Offer to Purchase. Certain provisions of the Merger Agreement
that the Board of Directors considered important included:

 

 

•  Termination Date. The termination date under the Merger Agreement on which either Parent or the Company, subject to certain
exceptions, can terminate the Merger Agreement, which is anticipated to allow for sufficient time to consummate the Offer and the
Merger while minimizing the length of time during which the Company would be required to operate subject to the restrictions on
interim operations set forth in the Merger Agreement.

 

 
•  Cooperation. The Merger Agreement requires Parent and Purchaser to use their reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer and

the Merger.
 

 
•  Industry and Economy. Our Board of Directors considered the current state of the economy and assessed the stage of the U.S. public sector

market industry cycle, financing markets, uncertainty in public sector contract pricing and uncertainty surrounding forecasted economic
conditions both in the near term and the long term, generally and within the Company’s industry in particular.

 

 
•  Certain Management Projections. Our Board of Directors considered certain forecasts for the Company prepared by senior management of

the Company, which reflected certain assumptions of the Company’s senior management. For further discussion, see “—Certain Unaudited
Prospective Financial Information.”

 

 •  Opinions of Financial Advisors
 

 
•  Evercore: The financial analyses reviewed by Evercore with our Board of Directors as well as the oral opinion of Evercore rendered

to our Board of Directors on February 9, 2018 (which was

subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Evercore’s written opinion addressed to our Board of Directors dated February 9,
2018), as to, as of February 9, 2018, the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common Stock other than Parent,
Purchaser and their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Excluded Holders”), of the consideration to be received by such holders in
the Offer and the Merger.

 

 

•  Macquarie Capital: The financial analyses reviewed by Macquarie Capital with our Board of Directors as well as the oral opinion of
Macquarie Capital rendered to our Board of Directors on February 9, 2018 (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by
delivery of Macquarie Capital’s written opinion addressed to our Board of Directors dated February 9, 2018), as to, as of February 9,
2018, the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common Stock other than the Excluded Holders of the
consideration to be received by such holders in the Offer and/or the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Our Board of Directors also considered a variety of risks and other potentially adverse factors in determining whether to approve the Merger
Agreement and the Transactions, including the following, which are not necessarily listed in order of relative importance:
 

 
•  the fact that the Company would no longer exist as an independent, publicly traded company, and the Company’s stockholders would no

longer participate in any future earnings or growth of the Company or benefit from the successful execution of the Company’s current
strategy as a public company;

 

 
•  the potential risk of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of the Company’s business and towards completion of

the Offer and the Merger;
 

 •  the risk of incurring substantial expenses related to the Offer and the Merger;
 

 
•  the risk that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the Offer and the Merger are not satisfied, and as a result, the Merger is not

completed;
 

 
•  the risks and costs to the Company if the Transactions do not close, including uncertainty about the effect of the proposed Offer and Merger

on the Company’s employees, customers and key relationships, which may impair the Company’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key
personnel, and could cause customers, suppliers and others to seek to change existing business relationships with the Company;

 

 •  the possibility that another party might have been willing to pay a higher purchase price for the Company than the Offer Price;
 

 •  the possibility that under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $204 million;
 

 
•  the possibility that, although the Offer and the Merger provide the Company’s stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium to the price

at which the Company’s Common Stock traded prior to the public announcement of the proposed transaction, the price of the Company’s
Shares might have increased in the future to a price greater than the Offer Price;

 

 
•  the potential conflict of interest created by the fact that the Company’s executive officers and directors have financial interests in the Offer

and the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of other stockholders, as more fully described in “Item 3. Past Contacts,
Transactions, Negotiations and Agreements—Arrangements between the Company and its Executive Officers, Directors and Affiliates”;

 

 
•  the fact that the gain realized by the Company’s stockholders as a result of the Offer and the Merger generally will be taxable to the

stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 
•  the restrictions in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of the Company’s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, which may

delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business or other opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger;

•  the potential effect of the public announcement of the Merger Agreement, including effects on the Company’s revenues, customers,

operating results and share price and the Company’s ability to attract and retain key management and personnel;
 

 
•  the risk of litigation in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the completion of the Offer and the consummation of the

Merger; and
 

 •  the fact that the Merger Agreement precludes the Company from actively soliciting alternative transaction proposals.

Our Board of Directors concluded that the risks, uncertainties, restrictions and potentially negative reasons associated with the Offer and Merger
were outweighed by the potential benefits of the Offer and Transactions.

The foregoing discussion of our Board of Directors’ reasons for its recommendation to accept the Offer is not meant to be exhaustive, but
addresses the material information and factors considered by our Board of Directors in connection with its recommendation. In view of the wide variety
of reasons considered by our Board of Directors in connection with the evaluation of the Offer and the complexity of these matters, our Board of
Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific reasons considered in reaching its
determination and recommendation. Rather, our directors made their determinations and recommendations based on the totality of the information
presented to them, and the judgments of individual members of our Board of Directors may have been influenced to a greater or lesser degree by
different reasons.

The foregoing description of the consideration by our Board of Directors of the reasons supporting the Merger Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
and the other Transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is forward-looking in nature. This information should be read in light of the factors
discussed in the Section entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” below.

(iii) Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information

Except for annual guidance, the Company does not, as a matter of course, publicly disclose forecasts or projections as to future performance,
earnings or other results due to the inherent unpredictability of the underlying assumptions, estimates and projections. In the normal course of its
financial planning, management of the Company prepared and provided to Parent, other potential transaction counterparties, our Board of Directors,
Evercore and Macquarie Capital financial forecasts. The Company’s management subsequently provided to Parent and other potential transaction
counterparties guidance regarding management’s expectations on the impact on such forecasts of the recent enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (as
defined below) and separately provided to our Board of Directors, Evercore and Macquarie Capital financial forecasts that were revised upward,
adjusted to reflect the expected impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as requested by Evercore and Macquarie Capital, as well as other adjustments that
were immaterial when taken as a whole, in addition to extrapolations derived from such forecasts (together, the “projections”), and directed each of
Evercore and Macquarie Capital to use the projections in connection with rendering its fairness opinion to our Board of Directors and performing its
related financial analysis, as described above under the heading “—Opinions of Financial Advisors”.

The projections were prepared by our management for internal use. The projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure and,
accordingly, do not necessarily comply with published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation and presentation of financial forecasts, or generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Neither the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other independent accountants, have audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures
with respect to the projections or expressed any opinion or any form of assurance related thereto. The summary of the projections is included in this
Schedule 14D-9 solely to give the Company’s stockholders access to certain financial projections that were made available to Parent, other potential
transaction counterparties, the Board of Directors, Evercore and Macquarie Capital, and is not being

included in this Schedule 14D-9 to influence a Company stockholder’s decision whether to tender Shares in the Offer or for any other purpose.

The projections, while presented with numerical specificity, necessarily were based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently
uncertain and many of which are beyond the control of the Company’s management. Because the projections cover multiple years, by their nature, they
also become subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. The projections presented below were primarily based on a contract waterfall of
the Company’s existing engagements and assuming that such engagements would continue in the ordinary course. Important factors that may affect
actual results and result in the projections not being achieved include, but are not limited to, reduced spending levels and changing budget priorities of
the U.S. government, failure of the Company’s customers to fund contracts or exercise their options to extend contracts, competition from other market
participants, the Company’s inability to execute awarded contracts successfully and adverse results of audits and investigations conducted for various
agencies with which the Company contracts and other risk factors described in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2017, subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. In addition, the projections may be affected by the
Company’s ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over the applicable period. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the
projections will be realized, and actual results may vary materially from those shown.

The inclusion of the projections in this Schedule 14D-9 should not be regarded as an indication that the Company or any of its affiliates, advisors,
officers, directors or representatives considered or considers the projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and the projections
should not be relied upon as such. Neither the Company nor any of its respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives has made or
makes any representation to any of the Company’s stockholders or any other person regarding the ultimate performance of the Company compared to
the information contained in the projections or can give any assurance that actual results will not differ materially from the projections, and none of them
undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date the projections were
generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the projections are shown to be in
error. The Company does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the projections, except as otherwise required by law.
Neither the Company nor any of its respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors or representatives has made or makes any representation to any of
the Company’s stockholders or any other person regarding the ultimate performance of the Company compared to the information contained in the
projections or that the projections will be achieved.

Certain of the projected financial information set forth herein may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures
should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial
measures as used by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts used by other companies.

All financial projections are forward-looking statements. These and other forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by
the risks and uncertainties identified above and the cautionary statements contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
March 31, 2017 and quarterly and current reports on Form 10-Q and 8-K. Please consider carefully the discussion entitled “Cautionary Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” under “Item 8. Additional Information”.

In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the projections, the Company’s stockholders are cautioned not to place
undue, if any, reliance on the projections.

Adjusted EBITDA is based on our credit agreement, and may differ from other companies. Adjusted EBITDA differs from Adjusted EBITDA
disclosed in the Company’s reports filed with the SEC (“Reported Adjusted EBITDA”) because Reported Adjusted EBITDA does not include
expenses associated with stock based compensation.

(iv) Opinions of Financial Advisors

Opinion of Evercore

CSRA retained Evercore to act as its financial advisor in connection with evaluating strategic and financial alternatives, including the Offer and
subsequent merger (taken together, the “transaction”). As part of this engagement, CSRA requested that Evercore evaluate the fairness, from a financial
point of view, of the transaction consideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock, other than Parent, Purchaser and their respective
affiliates, entitled to receive such consideration. At a meeting of our Board of Directors held on February 9, 2018, Evercore rendered its oral opinion to
our Board of Directors, which opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 9, 2018, that, as of the date thereof,
and based upon and subject to the factors, procedures, assumptions, qualifications, limitations and other matters set forth in its written opinion, the
transaction consideration to be received by the holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration was fair, from a financial point of view,
to such holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such consideration.

The full text of Evercore’s written opinion, dated February 9, 2018, which sets forth, among other things, the factors considered,
procedures followed, assumptions made and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Evercore in rendering its
opinion, is attached as Annex I to this Schedule 14D-9 and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. CSRA urges you to read the
opinion carefully and in its entirety. Evercore’s opinion was addressed to, and for the information and benefit of, our Board of Directors in
connection with its evaluation of the transaction. Evercore’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the transaction as compared to other
business or financial strategies that might be available to CSRA, nor did it address the underlying business decision of CSRA to engage in the
transaction. Evercore’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation to our Board of Directors or to any other persons in respect of the
transaction, including as to how any holder of shares of Common Stock should vote or act with respect to the transaction. The summary of
Evercore’s opinion set forth in this Schedule 14D-9 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion attached as Annex I to
this Schedule 14D-9. Evercore has consented to the inclusion of its opinion as Annex I to this Schedule 14D-9.

In connection with rendering its opinion, Evercore, among other things:
 

 
•  reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to CSRA that Evercore deemed to be relevant, including

publicly available research analysts’ estimates;
 

 
•  reviewed certain non-public historical financial statements and other non-public historical financial and operating data relating to CSRA

prepared and furnished to Evercore by management of CSRA;
 

33

Table of Contents

 
•  reviewed certain non-public historical and projected operating data relating to CSRA prepared and furnished to Evercore by management of

CSRA as described in “—Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” above;
 

 
•  discussed the past and current operations, financial projections and current financial condition of CSRA with management of CSRA

(including their views on the risks and uncertainties of achieving such projections);
 

 •  reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of Common Stock;
 

 
•  compared the financial performance of CSRA and its stock market trading multiples with those of certain other publicly traded companies

that Evercore deemed relevant;
 

 
•  compared the financial performance of CSRA and the valuation multiples relating to the transaction with those of certain other transactions

that Evercore deemed relevant;
 

 
•  reviewed a draft of the merger agreement, dated February 6, 2018, which Evercore assumed was in substantially final form and from which

Evercore assumed the final form would not vary in any respect material to Evercore’s analysis; and
 

 •  performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that Evercore deemed appropriate.

For purposes of its analysis and opinion, Evercore assumed and relied upon, without undertaking any independent verification of, the accuracy
and completeness of all of the information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with, or
reviewed by Evercore, and Evercore assumed no liability therefor. With respect to the projected financial data relating to CSRA referred to above,
Evercore assumed that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of CSRA
management as to the future financial performance of CSRA. Evercore expressed no view as to any projected financial data relating to CSRA or the
assumptions on which they are based.

For purposes of rendering its opinion, Evercore assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the representations and warranties of each
party contained in the Merger Agreement were true and correct, that each party would perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be
performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the merger would be satisfied without material waiver or
modification thereof. Evercore further assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases necessary for the
consummation of the Merger would be obtained without any material delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on
CSRA or the consummation of the Merger or materially reduce the benefits to the holders of Common Stock of the Merger.

Evercore did not make or assume any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of CSRA, nor
was Evercore furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor did Evercore evaluate the solvency or fair value of CSRA under any state or federal
laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Evercore’s opinion was necessarily based upon information made available to Evercore as of
the date thereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed and as could be evaluated on the date thereof. It was understood
that subsequent developments could affect Evercore’s opinion and that Evercore did not and does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm
its opinion.

Evercore was not asked to pass upon, and expressed no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness to the holders of Common
Stock, from a financial point of view, of the transaction consideration. Evercore did not express any view on, and its opinion did not address, the fairness
of the proposed transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other securities, creditors or other
constituencies of CSRA, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or
employees of CSRA, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the

transaction consideration or otherwise. Evercore assumed that any modification to the structure of the transaction would not vary in any respect material
to its analysis. Evercore’s opinion did not address the relative merits of the transaction as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be
available to CSRA, nor did it address the underlying business decision of CSRA to engage in the transaction. Evercore’s opinion did not constitute a
recommendation to our Board of Directors or to any other persons in respect of the transaction, including as to how any holder of shares of Common
Stock should vote or act in respect of the transaction. Evercore is not a legal, regulatory, accounting or tax expert and has assumed the accuracy and
completeness of assessments by CSRA and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.

Summary of Material Financial Analyses

The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses that Evercore reviewed with our Board of Directors on February 9, 2018, in
connection with rendering Evercore’s opinion. The following summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by
Evercore. The order of the analyses described and the results of these analyses do not represent relative importance or weight given to these analyses by
Evercore or our Board of Directors. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is
based on market data that existed on or before February 6, 2018 and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to summary
description.

In arriving at its opinion, Evercore did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,
Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of the
analyses. Considering selected portions of the analyses and reviews in the summary set forth below, without considering the analyses and reviews as a
whole, could create an incomplete or misleading view of the analyses and reviews underlying Evercore’s opinion.

For purposes of its analyses and reviews, Evercore considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions
and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of CSRA. No company, business or transaction used in Evercore’s analyses and reviews as a
comparison is identical to CSRA, the transaction or the transaction consideration, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses and reviews is not
entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses and reviews involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating
characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions used in
Evercore’s analyses and reviews. The estimates contained in Evercore’s analyses and reviews, and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular
analysis or review, are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less
favorable than those suggested by Evercore’s analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating to the value of companies, businesses or
securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the
estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s analyses and reviews are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

The following summary of material financial analyses includes information presented in tabular format. These tables must be read
together with the full text of each summary in order to understand fully the summary of material financial analyses performed by Evercore.
The tables are not intended to stand alone and alone do not constitute a complete description of the material financial analyses performed by
Evercore. Considering the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the material financial analyses, including the
methodologies and assumptions underlying such analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Evercore’s financial analyses.

Table of Contents

In performing the financial analyses summarized below, Evercore utilized and relied upon projected financial data though the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2021 and projections extrapolated based on that data for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, in each case prepared
and furnished to Evercore by CSRA’s management and as described in the section entitled “—Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information”
above.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

As part of its analysis, Evercore performed a discounted cash flow analysis of CSRA. This is a method used to estimate the implied present value
of an asset by calculating the present value of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows to be generated by that asset. The present value of those
future unlevered free cash flows is then obtained by discounting those future unlevered free cash flows or amounts by a discount rate that takes into
account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital and other appropriate factors. The “unlevered free cash flow”
refers to a calculation of the future cash flows generated by an asset without including in such calculation any debt servicing costs. Specifically,
unlevered free cash flow for this purpose represents earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, less income tax expense, capital expenditures, increases
in net working capital and certain other cash expenses, as applicable, plus depreciation and amortization.

Evercore’s discounted cash flow analysis was intended to estimate the implied present value, as of March 31, 2018, of (1) the future unlevered free
cash flow that CSRA would generate during the period from April 1, 2018, through March 31, 2023, plus (2) the estimated terminal value of CSRA as
of March 31, 2023, using both the perpetuity growth methodology and the terminal value methodology. Evercore performed its discounted cash flow
analysis for CSRA on a standalone basis and assumed the mid-year cash flow discounting convention. Evercore’s discounted cash flow analyses include
value attributable to the pre-tax value of certain tax attributes of $734 million outstanding as of March 31, 2018, which we refer to collectively as the
“tax attributes.” Evercore incorporated the present value of the savings generated from the use of the tax attributes into its discounted cash flow analysis.
Evercore conducted its discounted cash flow analysis using financial forecasts provided by CSRA’s management. At the direction of CSRA’s
management, Evercore conducted a discounted cash flow analysis that excluded CSRA’s $404 million unfunded pension liability, net of taxes at 24%
(which we refer to as the “pension liability”), and a discounted cash flow analysis that included the pension liability.

Under the perpetuity growth methodology, Evercore estimated a terminal value for CSRA by applying a perpetuity growth rate of 2.0% to 3.0% to
the estimated unlevered free cash flow of CSRA for the terminal year, which assumed, among other things, projected levels of tax expense, capital
expenditure, changes in net working capital, and depreciation and amortization. The cash flows and terminal value were then discounted to present value
using a range of discount rates from 7.5% to 9.5%, based on an estimate of CSRA’s weighted average cost of capital. Evercore estimated CSRA’s
weighted average cost of capital based on application of the capital asset pricing model and its professional judgment given the nature of CSRA’s
business and its industry. The resulting range of implied enterprise values for CSRA was then reduced by the amount of CSRA’s projected net debt
(calculated as debt less cash and cash equivalents) as of December 29, 2017, the amount of CSRA’s noncontrolling interests (calculated as the
noncontrolling interest balance as of December 29, 2017, based on available public filings) and, in the analysis including the pension liability, the
amount of the pension liability, and increased by the present value of the savings generated from the use of the tax attributes (based on assumptions
provided by CSRA’s management), to produce a range of implied equity values for CSRA. Under the perpetuity growth methodology excluding pension
liabilities, Evercore’s discounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied per-share equity value for CSRA on a standalone basis of approximately
$29.50 to $56.95. Under the perpetuity growth methodology including pension liabilities, Evercore’s discounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied
per-share equity value for CSRA on a standalone basis of approximately $27.70 to $55.15.

Under the terminal value multiple methodology, Evercore estimated a terminal value for CSRA by applying a multiple range of 10.0x to 12.0x to
the projected Adjusted EBITDA of CSRA in a projected steady-state

terminal year. Evercore estimated the terminal value multiple based on the financial forecasts provided by CSRA’s management, the trading multiples
for the companies included in the selected publicly traded companies analysis described below, and its professional judgment given the nature of CSRA
and its business and industry. The cash flows and terminal value were then discounted to present value using the same range of discount rates as
described above, and converted to implied equity value using the same adjustments as described above. Under the terminal value multiple methodology
excluding pension liabilities, Evercore’s discounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied per share equity value for Common Stock on a standalone
basis of approximately $32.00 to $43.45. Under the terminal value multiple methodology including pension liabilities, Evercore’s discounted cash flow
analysis indicated an implied per share equity value for Common Stock on a standalone basis of approximately $30.15 to $41.60.

Evercore compared the results of this analysis to the transaction consideration of $40.75 per share of Common Stock.

Precedent Transactions Analysis

Evercore reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information relating to 13 precedent transactions involving companies that Evercore
considered to be relevant to CSRA’s business and industry, which we refer to as the “precedent transactions.” Evercore selected the precedent
transactions because they represented transactions of which Evercore was aware that were announced between May 2010 and January 2018 involving
companies in the government services vertical. Evercore considered, in its professional judgment and experience, these transactions most relevant to the
transaction. No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to CSRA or the transaction. Accordingly, an
evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the relative values of the selected companies.

Evercore reviewed, among other things, the transaction value of each precedent transaction as a multiple of the target company’s earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which we refer to as “EBITDA,” (in each case, to the extent publicly available and calculated for the
twelve month period ending prior to the date of announcement of the transaction, which we refer to as “LTM EBITDA”). The financial data used by
Evercore for the precedent transactions was based on publicly available information, which in some cases was incomplete and required Evercore to
make certain assumptions it deemed appropriate in connection with its analysis. The transaction values reflected exclude the full value of disclosed tax
benefits, except as noted below.

(2) SRA LTM EBITDA reflects Adjusted Operating Income per SRA public company filings and adjustments for cost savings initiatives and the

annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions occurring during the twelve month period ended December 21, 2010 per subsequent disclosure.

Based on the multiples it derived for the precedent transactions and based on its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied a
transaction value to LTM EBITDA multiple reference range of 9.5x to 12.0x to CSRA’s Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve month period ended
December 29, 2017. This analysis implied an equity value range per share of Common Stock of $27.75 to $39.50. Evercore compared the results of this
analysis to the transaction consideration of $40.75 per share of Common Stock.

Although the precedent transactions were used for comparison purposes, none of those transactions is identical or directly comparable to the
transaction, and none of the target companies in the precedent transactions is identical or directly comparable to CSRA. In evaluating the precedent
transactions, Evercore made judgments and assumptions with regard to general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters,
many of which are beyond the control of CSRA, such as the impact of competition on the business of CSRA and the industry generally, industry growth
and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial conditions and prospects of CSRA, the industry or in the financial markets in general.
Mathematical analysis, such as determining the mean or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using the transaction data of the precedent
transactions.

Peer Group Trading Multiples Analysis

In performing a trading multiple analysis of CSRA, Evercore reviewed publicly available financial and market information for CSRA and the
selected public companies listed in the table below, which we refer to as

“selected public companies.” Evercore deemed the selected public companies most relevant to consider in relation to CSRA, based on its professional
judgment and experience, because they include businesses that provide government services with operations that, for purposes of its analysis, Evercore
considered similar to the operations of CSRA. However, Evercore noted that none of the selected public companies is identical to CSRA because of
inherent differences in the businesses, operations, performance, financial conditions and prospects of each company.

For each of the selected public companies identified below, Evercore calculated multiples of total enterprise value, which we refer to as “TEV,” to
estimated Adjusted EBITDA, TEV to estimated Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures and share price to estimated adjusted earnings per share for
calendar years 2018 and 2019 based on closing stock prices as of February 6, 2018. The financial data of the selected public companies used by
Evercore for this analysis were consensus estimates based on publicly available equity research analysts’ projections.

The analysis indicated the following with respect to the peer group:

(2) Engility enterprise value net of estimated $220 million value of tax attributes reflecting $370 million value per Company disclosure adjusted for
21% tax rate.

Based upon the information presented in the tables above and the application of Evercore’s experience and professional judgment, Evercore
selected reference multiple ranges of TEV to estimated Adjusted EBITDA of 10.0x to 12.0x for calendar year 2018 and 10.0x to 11.5x for calendar year
2019, TEV to estimated Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure of 12.5x to 14.0x for calendar year 2018 and 12.0 to 13.5x for calendar year 2019
and share price to estimated adjusted earnings per share of 12.5x to 15.0x for calendar year 2018 and 12.0x to 14.0x for calendar year 2019. These
ranges were then applied to CSRA’s estimated Adjusted EBITDA, estimated Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure and estimated adjusted earnings
per share for calendar years 2018 and 2019 of $2.01 and $2.28, respectively, as estimated by management.

Using this analysis, Evercore derived the following ranges of implied equity values per share of Common Stock:
 

   CY18E    CY19E  
TEV / Adjusted EBITDA Multiple   $ 30.55 – $40.55   $ 31.35 – $38.60 
TEV / Adjusted EBITDA – Capex Multiple   $ 33.10 – $39.10   $ 33.90 – $40.25 
Price / Adjusted EPS Multiple   $ 27.30 – $32.75   $ 28.35 – $33.05 

Evercore compared the results of this analysis to the transaction consideration of $40.75 per share of Common Stock.

Premiums Paid Analysis

Evercore reviewed, for reference and informational purposes only and not as part of its financial analysis in connection with rendering its advice,
the premiums paid for (i) acquisitions by strategic buyers of U.S. public targets with an aggregate transaction value between $5 billion and $15 billion
announced through February 6, 2018 where the consideration was 100% cash, of which there were 19, and (ii) acquisitions by strategic buyers of U.S.
public targets with an aggregate transaction value between $5 billion and $15 billion announced through February 6, 2018, regardless of the form of
consideration, of which there were 13, in each case excluding acquisitions of financial, pharmaceutical, REIT and MLP targets, mergers of equals,
leveraged buyouts and transactions leaked more than one month prior to signing. Using information from Securities Data Corp., Evercore calculated the
premiums paid as the percentage by which the per share consideration paid in each such transaction exceeded the closing market share prices of the
target companies one day and four weeks prior to announcement of each transaction.

Top Quartile    44.1%   43.8% 
High    70.2%   77.0% 

Based on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment and experience, Evercore applied a range of premiums of 25.0% to 35.0% to the
closing price per share of Common Stock of $31.00 as of February 6, 2018, which resulted in an implied value range of $38.20 to $41.25 per share.

Evercore compared the results of this analysis to the transaction consideration of $40.75 per share of Common Stock.

Historical Trading Range Analysis

Evercore reviewed, for reference and informational purposes only and not as part of its financial analysis in connection with rendering its advice,
historical trading prices of shares of Common Stock during the 52-week period ended February 6, 2018. Evercore noted that the low and high closing
prices during such period ranged from $27.38 to $33.79 per share of Common Stock, as compared to the transaction consideration of $40.75 per share of
Common Stock.

Present Value of Research Analyst Price Targets Analysis

Evercore reviewed, for reference and informational purposes only and not as part of its financial analysis in connection with rendering its advice,
publicly available research analyst estimates of potential future value for shares of Common Stock, or “price targets,” known to Evercore as of
February 6, 2018. Evercore assumed an 11.4% cost of equity, calculated using the capital asset pricing model, for each of the lowest analyst price target
estimate of $29.00 per share and the highest analyst price target of $42.00 per share. Evercore noted that the present value of research analyst price
targets ranged from $26.05 to $37.70 per share of Common Stock, as compared to the transaction consideration of $40.75 per share of Common Stock.

General

In connection with the review of the transaction by our Board of Directors, Evercore performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for
purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, is not readily
susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary described above, without considering the
analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Evercore’s opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Evercore
considered the results of all the analyses and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one analysis or factor considered by it for
purposes of its opinion. Rather, Evercore made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering
the results of all the analyses. In addition, Evercore may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and
may have considered various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. The range of valuations resulting from any particular analysis
or combination of analyses described above should therefore not be taken to be Evercore’s view of the actual value of the shares of Common Stock. No
company used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to CSRA, and no transaction used is directly comparable to the transaction.
Further, Evercore’s analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that
could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies or transactions used, including judgments and assumptions with regard to
industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of CSRA or
its advisors. Rounding may result in total sums set forth in this section not equaling the total of the figures shown.

Evercore prepared these analyses solely for the purpose of providing an opinion to our Board of Directors as to the fairness of the transaction
consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common Stock, other than Parent, Purchaser and their respective affiliates, entitled to
receive such consideration. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals of CSRA or to necessarily reflect the prices at which CSRA or its securities
actually may be sold. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more
or less favorable than those suggested by such estimates. Accordingly, estimates used in, and the results derived from, Evercore’s analyses are inherently
subject to substantial uncertainty, and Evercore assumes no responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted in such
estimates. The issuance of the fairness opinion was approved by an opinion committee of Evercore.

to our Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Pursuant to the terms of its engagement letter, Evercore is entitled to receive (1) an opinion
fee of $5,000,000, regardless of the conclusion reached therein, which was earned upon delivery of its fairness opinion and which is fully creditable, to
the extent previously paid, against any transaction fee payable and (2) a transaction fee, comprised of a success fee and a discretionary component,
currently estimated to total approximately $40,000,000 which Evercore will earn subject to and upon the consummation of the merger. In addition,
CSRA has agreed to reimburse Evercore for its expenses in an amount up to $50,000 (including external legal fees, expenses and disbursements)
incurred in connection with its engagement and to indemnify Evercore and any of its members, partners, officers, directors, advisors, representatives,
employees, agents, affiliates or controlling persons, if any, against certain liabilities and expenses arising out of Evercore’s engagement, any services
performed by Evercore in connection therewith or any transaction contemplated thereby.

Prior to this engagement, Evercore and its affiliates provided financial advisory services to CSRA and had received fees for the rendering of these
services including the reimbursement of expenses. During the two-year period prior to the date of Evercore’s opinion, no material relationship existed
between Evercore and its affiliates and General Dynamics pursuant to which compensation was received by Evercore or its affiliates as a result of such
relationship. Evercore or its affiliates may provide financial or other services to CSRA or General Dynamics in the future and in connection with any
such services Evercore and its affiliates may receive compensation.

In the ordinary course of business, Evercore or its affiliates may actively trade the securities, or related derivative securities, or financial
instruments of CSRA, General Dynamics and their respective affiliates for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly, may
at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or instruments.

Our Board of Directors engaged Evercore to act as its financial advisor based on its qualifications, experience and reputation. Evercore is an
internationally recognized investment banking firm and is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses in connection with mergers and acquisitions,
leveraged buyouts, competitive biddings, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

Opinion of Macquarie Capital

On February 9, 2018, Macquarie Capital rendered its oral opinion to our Board of Directors (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by
delivery of Macquarie Capital’s written opinion addressed to our Board of Directors dated the same date) as to, as of February 9, 2018, the fairness,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common Stock, other than the Excluded Holders, of the consideration to be received by such holders in
the Offer and/or the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Macquarie Capital’s opinion was directed to our Board of Directors (in its capacity as such), and only addressed the fairness, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Common Stock, other than the Excluded Holders, of the consideration to be received by such holders in
the Offer and/or the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement and did not address any other aspect or implication of the Offer or the Merger.
The summary of Macquarie Capital’s opinion in this Schedule 14D-9 is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of its written
opinion, which is included as Annex II to this Schedule 14D-9, and sets forth the procedures followed, assumptions made, qualifications and
limitation on the review undertaken and other matters considered by Macquarie Capital in preparing its opinion. However, neither Macquarie
Capital’s written opinion nor the summary of its opinion and the related analyses set forth in this Schedule 14D-9 are intended to be, and they
do not constitute, a recommendation to our Board of Directors, any security holder of the Company or any other person as to whether or not to
tender any shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer or how to act or vote with respect to any matter relating to the Offer or the Merger.

In connection with its opinion, Macquarie Capital, among other things:
 

 •  reviewed a draft, dated February 9, 2018, of the Merger Agreement;
 

 •  reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information regarding the Company;
 

 
•  reviewed certain other financial and operating information relating to the Company, including financial projections and extrapolations of

such projections prepared or approved by the management of the Company (the “Company Projections”);
 

 
•  reviewed certain estimates prepared by the management of the Company as to the tax savings expected by such management to be achieved

as a result of the amortization of certain assets of the Company (the “Estimated Tax Savings”);
 

 
•  discussed the Offer and the Merger and the business, operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company with members of the

management of the Company;
 

 
•  reviewed certain financial and stock market data with respect to the Company and compared that data with similar data for other companies

with publicly traded equity securities that Macquarie Capital deemed relevant;
 

 
•  reviewed the publicly available financial terms of certain other business combinations and other transactions that Macquarie Capital deemed

relevant; and
 

 
•  performed such other financial analyses and considered such other information and factors that Macquarie Capital deemed appropriate for

purposes of its opinion.

Macquarie Capital did not undertake any responsibility for independently verifying, and did not independently verify, any of the foregoing
information and Macquarie Capital assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information. Management of the Company
advised Macquarie Capital, and Macquarie Capital assumed, that the Company Projections were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting
such management’s best currently available estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance and condition of the Company and the
Estimated Tax Savings were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting such management’s best currently available estimates and judgments
as to such tax savings, in each case including the potential impact of recent changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations pursuant to H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”), on the future financial performance of the Company and such tax savings,
as to which impact Macquarie Capital expressed no view or opinion. The Company advised Macquarie Capital and Macquarie Capital assumed that the
Company Projections and the Estimated Tax Savings were a reasonable basis on which to evaluate the Company and the Offer and the Merger and, at
the Company’s direction, Macquarie Capital used and relied upon the Company Projections and the Estimated Tax Savings for purposes of its analyses
and opinion. Macquarie Capital expressed no view or opinion as to the Company Projections or the Estimated Tax Savings or the assumptions upon
which they were based. Macquarie Capital further noted that (i) the actual and estimated financial and operating performance and the share price data
Macquarie Capital reviewed for the companies with publicly traded equity securities that Macquarie Capital deemed relevant and (ii) the financial terms
of certain other business combinations and other transactions that Macquarie Capital deemed relevant might not, in whole or in part, have reflected the
potential impact of recent changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Further, Macquarie Capital relied upon and
assumed, without independent verification, that there had been no change in the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations,
cash flows or prospects of the Company since the respective dates of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise,
provided to Macquarie Capital that would be material to its analysis or opinion, and that there was no information or any facts that would make any of
the information reviewed by Macquarie Capital incomplete or misleading. In connection with its opinion, Macquarie Capital did not make, or assume
any responsibility for making, any physical inspection, independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of
the Company, nor was Macquarie Capital furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals.

Macquarie Capital relied upon and assumed that the representations and warranties of each party in the Merger Agreement were true and correct,
that each party would fully and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement, that all
of the conditions to the consummation of the Offer and the Merger would be satisfied, and that the Offer and the Merger would be consummated in a
timely manner in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any terms or provisions
thereof. Macquarie Capital further assumed, with the Company’s consent, that the Offer and the Merger would be consummated in a manner that
complies in all respects with all applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations and that all governmental, regulatory, third-party and other
consents, approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the Offer and the Merger would be obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction
or condition (including the disposition of businesses or assets) that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits of the
proposed Offer and/or the Merger. In addition, Macquarie Capital assumed that the final form of the Merger Agreement would not differ from the draft
of the Merger Agreement reviewed by it.

Macquarie Capital’s opinion did not address the underlying business decision of our Board of Directors or the Company to effect the Offer and/or
the Merger or the relative merits of the Offer and/or the Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions available to the
Company. Macquarie Capital’s opinion was necessarily based on information made available to Macquarie Capital as of the date of the opinion and
financial, economic, market and other conditions as they existed and could be evaluated on the date of the opinion. Macquarie Capital does not have any
obligation to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its opinion or to otherwise comment on or consider events occurring or coming to its attention after the
date of its opinion.

Macquarie Capital’s opinion only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common Stock other than the Excluded
Holders of the consideration to be received by such holders in the Offer and/or the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement and did not address any
other aspect or implication of the Offer or the Merger or any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in connection therewith or otherwise
including, without limitation, (i) the form or structure of the Offer and/or the Merger, or any portion thereof, and (ii) the fairness of the amount or nature
of, or any other aspect relating to, any compensation or consideration to be paid or payable to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the
Offer or the Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration or otherwise. Macquarie Capital did not provide any advice or opinion as
to matters that require legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance, executive compensation, tax or other similar professional advice. Macquarie Capital
assumed that the Company had obtained or would obtain such advice or opinions from appropriate professional sources. Furthermore, Macquarie
Capital relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the assessments by the Company, Parent and their respective advisors with respect to all legal,
regulatory, accounting, insurance, executive compensation and tax matters. Macquarie Capital did not express any opinion as to whether or not the
Company, Parent, their security holders or any other party was receiving or paying reasonably equivalent value in the Offer and/or the Merger, the
solvency, creditworthiness or fair value of the Company or any other participant in the Offer and/or the Merger, or any of their respective assets, under
any applicable laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar matters. Macquarie Capital’s opinion does not constitute a
recommendation to the Board of Directors, the Company, the holders of Common Stock or any other person as to how to act or vote with respect to any
matter relating to the Offer or the Merger including whether or not to tender shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer.

Under the terms of its engagement, neither Macquarie Capital’s opinion nor any other advice or services rendered by it in connection with the
proposed Offer and Merger or otherwise, should be construed as creating, and Macquarie Capital will not be deemed to have, any fiduciary, agency or
similar duty to our Board of Directors, the Company, Parent, any security holder or creditor of the Company, Parent or any other person, regardless of
any prior or ongoing advice or relationships. Under the terms of its engagement, Macquarie Capital was retained by the Company as an independent
contractor and the opinion and other advice rendered by Macquarie Capital were provided solely for the use and benefit of our Board of Directors (in its
capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the proposed Offer and Merger. As a matter of state law, Macquarie

Capital believes the opinion and other advice of Macquarie Capital may not be used or relied upon by any other person without its prior written consent.
See e.g., Joyce v. Morgan Stanley, 538 F.3d 797 (7th Cir. 2008), HA2003 Liquidating Trust v. Credit Suisse Secs. (USA) LLC, 517 F.3d 454 (7th Cir.
2008) and Collins v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 224 F.3d 496 (5th Cir. 2000). By limiting the foregoing statement to matters of state law, Macquarie
Capital is not, and should not be deemed to be, admitting that Macquarie Capital has any liability to any persons with respect to its advice or opinion
under the federal securities laws. Furthermore such statement is not intended to affect the rights and responsibilities of our Board of Directors under
governing state law or the federal securities laws. Any claims under the federal securities laws against Macquarie Capital or our Board of Directors will
be subject to adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses reviewed by Macquarie Capital with our Board of Directors in connection with the
rendering of its opinion to our Board of Directors on February 9, 2018. The summary does not contain all of the financial data holders of Common Stock
may want or need for purposes of making an independent determination of fair value. Holders of Common Stock are encouraged to consult with their
own financial and other advisors before making an investment decision in connection with the proposed Offer and/or the Merger. The analyses
summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the analyses, as well as
the methodologies underlying, and the assumptions, qualifications and limitations affecting, each analysis, could create a misleading or incomplete view
of Macquarie Capital’s analyses.

For purposes of its analyses, Macquarie Capital reviewed a number of financial metrics including:
 

 

•  enterprise value – generally the value as of a specified date of the relevant company’s outstanding equity securities (taking into account its
options and other outstanding convertible securities) plus the value as of such date of its net debt (the value of its outstanding indebtedness,
preferred stock, capital lease obligations and non-controlling interests less the amount of cash on its balance sheet), which, except to the
extent reflected in the value of the Company’s outstanding equity securities, did not include the net present value of the tax savings expected
by the Company’s management to be achieved as a result of the amortization of certain assets of the Company based on the Estimated Tax
Savings.

 

 
•  adjusted EBITDA – generally the amount of the relevant company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for a

specific time period, as adjusted for certain non-recurring items and treating stock based compensation as an expense.
 

 
•  adjusted EBITDA – Capex – generally the amount of the relevant company’s adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures for a specific time

period.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, (1) share prices for the selected companies used in the selected companies analysis described below were as of
February 8, 2018, (2) the transaction values for the selected transactions used in the selected transactions analysis described below were calculated on an
enterprise value basis based on the consideration proposed to be paid in the selected transactions as of the date of the announcement, (3) estimates of
future financial performance of the Company were based on the Company Projections and (4) estimates of future financial performance for the selected
companies listed below were based on publicly available research analyst estimates for those companies.

Selected Companies Analysis

Macquarie Capital considered certain financial data for the Company and selected companies with publicly traded equity securities Macquarie
Capital deemed relevant. The financial data reviewed included:
 

 •  enterprise value as a multiple of estimated revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, or “FY 2019E Revenue”;
 

 •  enterprise value as a multiple of estimated adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, or “FY 2019E Adj. EBITDA”; and

FY 2019E Revenue, 10.0x to 12.0x to the Company’s FY 2019E Adj. EBITDA and 11.5x to 14.0x to the Company’s FY 2019E Adj. EBITDA – Capex.
The selected companies analysis indicated an implied value reference range of $21.20 to $30.97 per share of Common Stock based on the Company’s
FY 2019E Revenue, $30.41 to $40.07 per share of Common Stock based on the Company’s FY 2019E Adj. EBITDA, and $29.32 to $39.59 per share of
Common Stock based on the Company’s FY 2019E Adj. EBITDA – Capex, in each case as compared to the consideration of $40.75 per share of
Common Stock in the Offer and the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Taking into account the results of the selected transactions analysis, Macquarie Capital applied a multiple range of 9.0x to 12.7x to the Company’s
calendar year 2017 adjusted EBITDA and 10.0x to 13.5x to the Company’s calendar year 2017 adjusted EBITDA – Capex. The selected companies
analysis indicated an implied value reference range of $25.21 to $42.63 per share of Common Stock based on the Company’s calendar year 2017
adjusted EBITDA and $22.68 to $36.88 per share of Common Stock based on the Company’s calendar year 2017 adjusted EBITDA – Capex, in each
case as compared to the consideration of $40.75 per share of Common Stock in the Offer and the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Macquarie Capital performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company by calculating the estimated net present value of the projected
after-tax unlevered, free cash flow of the Company based on the Company Projections and the net present value of the tax savings expected by Company
management to be achieved as a result of the amortization of certain assets of the Company based on the Estimated Tax Savings. Macquarie Capital
applied a range of terminal value multiples of 9.0x to 11.0x to the Company’s estimated adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023
based on the Company Projections and then estimated the net present value of the projected after-tax unlevered free cash flows based on the Company
Projections and the terminal values using discount rates ranging from 6.5% to 8.5%. An estimate of the net present value of the tax savings expected by
Company management to be achieved as a result of the amortization of certain assets of the Company based on the Estimated Tax Savings was also
calculated using a discount rate of 3.68%. The discounted cash flow analysis indicated an implied value reference range of $29.40 to $41.38 per share of
Common Stock, as compared to the consideration of $40.75 per share of Common Stock in the Offer and the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Other Matters

Macquarie Capital acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Offer and/or the Merger and will receive a transaction fee for
its services based on the value of the transaction upon the earlier of the acceptance of shares of Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer and
the Merger, which transaction fee, inclusive of a discretionary component agreed to by the Company, will be approximately $15,000,000. Macquarie
Capital also became entitled to a fee of $5,000,000 upon the delivery of its opinion, which is creditable to the extent previously paid against the
transaction fee. In certain circumstances Macquarie Capital will be entitled to receive a portion of any termination, breakup, topping or other similar fee
or any other form of compensation or expense reimbursement payable to the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement. In addition, the Company
agreed to reimburse Macquarie Capital for certain of its expenses and to indemnify Macquarie Capital and certain related parties against certain
liabilities arising out of its engagement. Macquarie Capital has in the past and may in the future seek to expand its business and commercial
relationships with the Company, Parent, any other company that may be involved in the Offer and/or the Merger and their respective affiliates. In the
ordinary course of business, Macquarie Capital and its affiliates may acquire, hold, sell or trade

debt, equity and other securities and financial instruments (including derivatives, loans and other obligations) of the Company, Parent, any other
company that may be involved in the Offer and/or the Merger and their respective affiliates, for its and their own accounts and for the accounts of its and
their customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or financial instruments. Macquarie Capital and its
affiliates provide a wide range of investment banking advice and services, including financial advisory services, securities underwritings and
placements, securities sales and trading, brokerage advice and services, and loans.
 
 (v) Intent to Tender

To the knowledge of the Company after making reasonable inquiry, all of the Company’s executive officers and directors currently intend to
tender all of the Shares that they hold of record or beneficially own in the Offer. The foregoing does not include any Shares over which, or with respect
to which, any such executive officer or director acts in a fiduciary or representative capacity or is subject to the instructions of a third party with respect
to such tender.

 
Item 5. Person/Assets Retained, Employed, Compensated or Used.

Neither the Company nor any person acting on its behalf has or currently intends to directly or indirectly employ, retain or compensate any person
to make solicitations or recommendations to the Company’s stockholders on its behalf with respect to the Offer.

The Company retained Evercore as its financial advisor in connection with the Company’s consideration of potential strategic transactions and not
to make any solicitation or recommendation in connection with any transactions. For information regarding the Company’s retention of Evercore, see
“Item 4. The Solicitation or Recommendation—Reasons for Recommendation—Opinion of Evercore.”

The Company retained Macquarie Capital as its financial advisor in connection with the Company’s consideration of potential strategic
transactions, including the Transactions, and not to make any solicitation or recommendations in connection with any transactions. For information
regarding the Company’s retention of Macquarie Capital, see “Item 4. The Solicitation or Recommendation—Reasons for Recommendation—Opinion
of Macquarie Capital.”

We have retained Computershare Trust Company, N.A. to act as the tabulation agent (the “Tabulation Agent”) on behalf of the Company for the
purpose of receiving and tabulating Shares beneficially held under the 401(k) Plan that are tendered in connection with the Offer. The Tabulation Agent
will also deliver materials relating to the Offer to beneficial owners of Shares held under the 401(k) Plan. The Company estimates that the Tabulation
Agent will receive approximately $20,000 for its services. The Tabulation Agent will be reimbursed for certain reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and
will be indemnified against certain liabilities in connection therewith.

 
Item 6. Interest in Securities of the Subject Company.

Other than the grant of the 2018 RSU awards and other grants in the ordinary course of business in connection with the Company’s employee
benefit plans or as otherwise described in this Item 6, no transactions in the Shares have been effected during the past 60 days by the Company, or, to the
best knowledge of the Company, by any of the Company’s directors, executive officers, subsidiaries or affiliates, except for the transactions set forth in
the chart below.

Item 7. Purposes of the Transaction, Plans or Proposals.

Except as set forth in this Schedule 14D-9 (including in the exhibits and annexes hereto) or as incorporated by reference in this Schedule 14D-9,
the Company is not undertaking or engaged in any negotiations in response to the Offer that relate to or would be expected to result in:
 

 •  a tender offer or other acquisition of our securities by the Company, any subsidiary of the Company or any other person; or
 

 
•  (i) any extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Company or any subsidiary of the Company,

(ii) any purchase, sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or (iii) any material
change in the present dividend rate or policy, or indebtedness or capitalization of the Company.

We have agreed that from the date of the Merger Agreement to the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which the Merger Agreement is
terminated, we will not, among other matters, solicit alternative acquisition offers. In addition, we have agreed to certain procedures that we must follow
in the event we receive an unsolicited acquisition proposal. The information set forth in Section 13—“The Transaction Documents—The Merger
Agreement” of the Offer to Purchase, which is filed as Exhibit (a)(1) of Schedule TO, is incorporated herein by reference.

Except as set forth in this Schedule 14D-9 (including in the exhibits and annexes hereto) or as incorporated in this Schedule 14D-9 by reference,
there are no transactions, resolutions of our Board of Directors, agreements in principle or signed contracts in response to the Offer that relate to or
would result in one or more of the matters referred to in this Item 7.

 
Item 8. Additional Information.

Golden Parachute Compensation

See “Item 3. Past Contacts, Transactions, Negotiations and Agreements—Arrangements between the Company and its Executive Officers,
Directors and Affiliates—Golden Parachute Compensation,” which is incorporated by reference herein.

Conditions of the Offer

The information set forth in Section 15—“Conditions to the Offer” of the Offer to Purchase, which is filed as Exhibit (a)(1) of Schedule TO, is
incorporated herein by reference.

Appraisal Rights

The Company’s stockholders will not have appraisal or dissenters’ rights as a result of the Offer and it is expected that the Company’s
stockholders will not have appraisal or dissenters’ rights in connection with the Merger. The Company is a Nevada corporation, and therefore the
existence or lack of appraisal or dissenters’ rights is governed by the NRS. Pursuant to Chapter 92A of the NRS, a stockholder of a Nevada corporation
is generally entitled to dissenters’ rights and to demand payment of the fair value (as defined in NRS 92A.320) for shares upon the consummation of a
merger to which the Nevada corporation is a party if (i) stockholder approval is required for the merger pursuant to applicable provisions of the NRS or
(ii) the Nevada corporation is a subsidiary that has merged with its parent entity pursuant to the short-form merger provisions of NRS 92A.180.
Notwithstanding this general rule, however, there are no appraisal or dissenters’ rights with respect to a merger in favor of any holder of any class or
series of shares that, on the day before the effective date of such merger (if no meeting of the stockholders is held to act upon the merger), or on the
record date fixed by the corporation’s board of directors to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the stockholder meeting
at which such plan of merger is to be acted upon (if a meeting of the stockholders is held to act upon the merger),

9/28/2019 SC 14D9

Table of Contents

are listed on the NYSE or other national securities exchange, unless such holder is required by such merger to accept any merger consideration other
than cash or securities meeting certain qualifications under NRS 92A.390(3). In the Merger, each issued and outstanding Share that is not purchased by
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price and no other form of consideration.
It also is anticipated that Shares will continue to be listed on the NYSE on the day before the effective date of the Merger (if no meeting of the
stockholders is held to act upon the Merger), or on the record date of the stockholders’ meeting (if any such stockholders’ meeting is held to act upon the
approval of the Merger Agreement). Accordingly, it is expected that holders of Shares will not have appraisal or dissenters’ rights as a result of the
Merger.

If, however, it is determined that such a right to dissent is not eliminated by applicable laws, including NRS 92A.390, Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has
properly demanded payment (such Shares, collectively, the “Dissenting Shares”) will not be converted into a right to receive the Offer Price, and the
holders of the Dissenting Shares will be entitled to only such rights as are granted by NRS 92A.300 through 92A.500, inclusive.

Anti-Takeover Statute

Combinations with Interested Shareholders. Sections 78.411-78.444, inclusive, of the NRS contain provisions governing Combinations with
Interested Shareholders. For purposes of the NRS, “Combinations” include: (i) any merger or consolidation with any Interested Stockholder, (ii) any
sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition to any Interested Shareholder of corporate assets with an aggregate market value
equal to 5% or more the aggregate market value of the corporation’s consolidated assets, 5% or more of the outstanding shares of the corporation or 10%
or more of the earning power or net income of the corporation, (iii) the issuance to any Interested Shareholder of voting shares (except pursuant to a
share dividend or similar proportionate distribution) with an aggregate market value equal to 5% or more of the aggregate market value of all the
outstanding shares of the corporation, (iv) the dissolution of the corporation if proposed by or on behalf of any Interested Shareholder, (v) any
reclassification of securities, recapitalization or corporate reorganization that will have the effect of increasing the proportionate share of the
corporation’s outstanding voting shares held by any Interested Shareholder and (vi) any receipt by the Interested Stockholder of the benefit (except
proportionately as a stockholder) of any loan, advance, guarantee, pledge or other financial assistance. For purposes of the NRS, an “Interested
Stockholder” is defined to include any beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of the voting securities of a Nevada corporation and any person
who is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and was at any time during the preceding three years the beneficial owner or more than 10% of any
class of the voting securities of the Nevada corporation.

Subject to certain exceptions, the provisions of the NRS statute governing Combinations with Interested Stockholders provide that a Nevada
corporation may not engage in a Combination with an Interested Stockholder for two years after the date that the person first became an Interested
Stockholder unless the Combination or the transaction by which the person first became an Interested Stockholder is approved by the board of directors
before the person first became an Interested Stockholder.

As a part of the Board of Directors’ adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including the Offer and the Merger, the Board of Directors also took action to make the provisions of the Combinations with Interested Stockholders
statute not applicable to the acquisition of Shares by Purchaser and Parent pursuant to the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up Option and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Control Share Acquisitions. The NRS also contains a “control share acquisitions statute.” If applicable to a Nevada corporation this statute
restricts the voting rights of certain stockholders referred to “acquiring persons,” that acquire or offer to acquire ownership of a “controlling interest” in
the outstanding voting stock of an “issuing

Table of Contents

corporation.” For purposes of these provisions a “controlling interest” means with certain exceptions the ownership of outstanding voting stock
sufficient to enable the acquiring person to exercise one-fifth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority, or a majority or
more of all voting power in the election of directors and “issuing corporation” means a Nevada corporation that has 200 or more stockholders of record,
at least 100 of whom have addresses in Nevada appearing on the stock ledger of the corporation, and which does business in Nevada directly or through
an affiliated corporation. The voting rights of an acquiring person in the affected shares will be restored only if such restoration is approved by a
majority of the voting power of the corporation’s stockholders. The NRS allows a corporation to “opt-out” of the control share acquisitions statute by
providing in such corporation’s articles of incorporation or bylaws that the control share acquisitions statute does not apply to the corporation or to an
acquisition of a controlling interest specifically by types of existing or future stockholders, whether or not identified. The Company does not believe that
it is an “issuing corporation” and, as a result, does not believe that the control shares acquisition statute applies. In addition, the Company’s bylaws opt
out of the control share acquisition statute, thus rendering the control share acquisitions statute inapplicable to the acquisition of Shares by Purchaser
and Parent pursuant to the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up Option and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

State Takeover Statutes. A number of states have adopted laws that purport, to varying degrees, to apply to attempts to acquire corporations that
are incorporated in, or which have substantial assets, stockholders, principal executive offices or principal places of business or whose business
operations otherwise have substantial economic effects in, such states. The Company, directly or through subsidiaries, conducts business in a number of
states throughout the United States, some of which may have enacted such laws. Except as described herein, the Company does not know whether any
of these laws will, by their terms, apply to the Offer or the Merger, and the Company has not complied with any such laws. To the extent that certain
provisions of these laws purport to apply to the Offer or the Merger, the Company believes that there are reasonable bases for contesting such laws.]

Vote Required to Approve Merger; Short-Form Merger

The Board of Directors has adopted the Merger Agreement and approved the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement in accordance with the NRS. Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, if Purchaser owns one Share more
than 90% of the fully diluted Shares after completion of the Offer, including any “subsequent offering period,” and any exercise of the Top-Up Option,
Purchaser will merge with and into the Company through a “short form” merger in accordance with the applicable provisions of the NRS without prior
notice to, or any action by, any other stockholder of the Company. If Purchaser acquires, pursuant to the Offer or otherwise, 90% or less of the
outstanding Shares, and in certain other circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement, a record date will be fixed by the Board of Directors to
determine the Company’s stockholders entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, a special meeting of stockholders to vote on the approval of the
Merger Agreement. In such event, the affirmative vote of the Company’s stockholders holding a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding
Shares approving the Merger Agreement will be required under the NRS to effect the Merger.

Top-Up Option

The Company has granted to Parent and Purchaser the Top-Up Option to purchase that number of newly issued Top-Up Shares equal to the lesser
of (i) the Short-Form Merger Threshold or (ii) the aggregate number of Shares that the Company is authorized to issue under its articles of incorporation
but that are not issued and outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option.
For purposes of this Schedule 14D-9, the words “fully diluted,” when referring to Shares mean, as of any particular time, a determination based on the
total number of outstanding Shares (assuming the conversion or exercise of all derivative securities or other rights to acquire Shares regardless of the
conversion or exercise price, the vesting schedule or other terms and conditions thereof). The Top-Up Option will be exercisable at any time on or after
the Expiration Time. The Company will not be obligated to deliver the Top-Up Shares unless (i) immediately following the exercise of the Top-Up
Option, the number of Shares owned

Table of Contents

in the aggregate by Parent and Purchaser constitutes at least one share more than 90% of the number of fully diluted Shares that would be outstanding
immediately after the issuance of all Top-Up Shares and (ii) the Minimum Condition will have been satisfied.

If the Top-Up Option is exercisable and the Board of Directors or the committee comprised solely of the independent directors requests in writing
that Purchaser exercise the Top-Up Option, then Parent will cause Purchaser to exercise the Top-Up Option prior to its expiration. However, Purchaser
will not be required to exercise the Top-Up Option prior to the expiration of a subsequent offering period.

The purchase price for each Top-Up Share will be the Offer Price. The aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares or any portion
thereof may be paid by Purchaser (a) entirely in cash, (b) by paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of the Top-Up
Shares and by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of such purchase price for the
Top-Up Shares or (c) any combination thereof. Any such promissory note (i) will be full recourse against Parent, (ii) will bear simple interest at 6% per
annum, (iii) will mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of the promissory note, (iv) may be prepaid in whole or in part at
any time without premium or penalty, (v) will provide that upon any default, all principal and accrued interest will immediately become due and payable
and (vi) will have no other material terms.

The Top-Up Option is intended to expedite the timing of the completion of the Merger by permitting Parent and Purchaser to effect a “short-form”
merger pursuant to Chapter 92A of the NRS at a time when the approval of the Merger at a meeting of the stockholders of the Company would
otherwise be assured because of Purchaser’s ownership of a majority of the Shares following completion of the Offer.

The summary of the Top-Up Option in Section 13 —“The Transaction Documents—The Merger Agreement—Top-Up Option” of the Offer to
Purchase is incorporated by reference herein.

Section 14(f) Information Statement

The Information Statement filed as Exhibit (a)(17) and Annex III to this Schedule 14D-9 is being furnished pursuant to Rule 14f-1 of the
Exchange Act, in connection with the possible designation by Parent, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, of certain persons to be appointed to the Board
of Directors, other than at a meeting of the Company’s stockholders as described in the Information Statement, and is incorporated by reference herein.

Legal Proceedings

As of the date of this Schedule 14D-9, there are currently no legal proceedings pending relating to the Offer or the Merger.

Antitrust Compliance

Under the HSR Act and the rules that have been promulgated thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), certain transactions may not
be consummated unless certain information has been furnished to the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”) and
the FTC and certain waiting period requirements have been satisfied. These requirements apply to Purchaser’s acquisition of the Shares in the Offer.

Under the HSR Act, the purchase of Shares in the Offer may not be completed until the expiration of a 15 calendar day waiting period which
begins when Parent files a Premerger Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the FTC and the Antitrust Division, unless such waiting
period is earlier terminated by the FTC and the Antitrust Division or extended by the parties by re-filing the HSR notification form. If the end of the 15
calendar day waiting period is set to fall on a federal holiday or weekend day, the waiting period is automatically

extended until 11:59 P.M., Eastern Time, the next business day. If prior to the expiration or termination of the waiting period either the FTC or the
Antitrust Division issues a request for additional information or documentary material from Parent, the waiting period with respect to the Offer would be
extended until the tenth calendar day following the date of Parent’s substantial compliance with that request. After that time, absent Parent’s and the
Company’s agreement, the waiting period can be extended only by court order. The FTC and the Antitrust Division may terminate the applicable waiting
period at any time before its expiration. Private parties (as well as individual States of the United States) may also bring legal actions under the antitrust
laws of the United States or state antitrust laws.

Parent and the Company and certain of their subsidiaries conduct business in several countries outside of the United States. Other competition
agencies with jurisdiction over the Transactions could also initiate action to challenge or block the Transactions. In addition, in some jurisdictions, a
competitor, customer or other third party could initiate a private action under applicable antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin the Transactions
before the Transactions are consummated. Neither Parent nor the Company can be sure that a challenge to the Transactions will not be made or that, if a
challenge is made, that Parent and/or the Company, as applicable, will prevail.

and capital expenditures); as well as any assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. The following are some of the factors that could cause actual
future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements: (i) uncertainties as to the timing of the Offer and the merger;
(ii) the risk that the proposed transaction may not be completed in a timely manner or at all; (iii) uncertainties as to the percentage of the Company’s
stockholders tendering their shares in the Offer; (iv) the possibility that competing offers or acquisition proposals for the Company will be made; (v) the
possibility that any or all of the various conditions to the consummation of the Offer or the merger may not be satisfied or waived, including the failure
to receive any required regulatory approvals from any applicable governmental entities (or any conditions, limitations or restrictions placed on such
approvals); (vi) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement, including in
circumstances that would require the Company to pay a termination fee or other expenses; (vii) the effect of this announcement or the pendency of the
proposed transaction on the Company’s ability to retain and hire key personnel, its ability to maintain relationships with its customers, suppliers and
others with whom it does business, its business generally or its stock price; (viii) risks related to diverting management’s attention from the Company’s
ongoing business operations; (ix) the risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the proposed transaction may result in significant costs of
defense, indemnification and liability; and (x) other factors as set forth from time to time in the Company’s filings with the SEC, including its Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 and any subsequent Form 10-Qs, as well as the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO and other Offer

ANNEX I

[Evercore Letterhead]

February 9, 2018

The Board of Directors of
CSRA Inc.
3170 Fairview Park Drive
Falls Church, VA 22042

Members of the Board of Directors:

We understand that CSRA, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the
date hereof (the “Agreement”), with General Dynamics Corp., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and Red Hawk Enterprises Corp., a Nevada
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the Agreement, among other things, (i) Merger Sub will tender (the
“Offer”) for all current issued and outstanding shares of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (“Company Common Stock”) for $40.75 in cash per
share (the “Consideration”) and (ii) regardless of whether shares of Company Common Stock are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger (the
“Merger” and, together with the Offer, the “Transaction”), the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and each outstanding share
of Company Common Stock, other than shares of Company Common Stock issued and held or owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right
to receive the Consideration, without interest. The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement and terms used
herein and not defined shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement.

The Board of Directors of the Company has asked us whether, in our opinion, the Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, other than Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates, entitled to receive such Consideration.

In connection with rendering our opinion, we have, among other things:
 

 
(i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to the Company that we deemed to be relevant,

including publicly available research analysts’ estimates;
 

 
(ii) reviewed certain non-public historical financial statements and other non-public historical financial and operating data relating to

the Company prepared and furnished to us by management of the Company;
 

 
(iii) reviewed certain non-public historical and projected operating data relating to the Company prepared and furnished to us by

management of the Company;
 

 
(iv) discussed the past and current operations, financial projections and current financial condition of the Company with management

of the Company (including their views on the risks and uncertainties of achieving such projections);
 

 (v) reviewed the reported prices and the historical trading activity of the Company Common Stock;
 

 
(vi) compared the financial performance of the Company and its stock market trading multiples with those of certain other publicly

traded companies that we deemed relevant;

(vii) compared the financial performance of the Company and the valuation multiples relating to the Merger with those of certain other

transactions that we deemed relevant;
 

 
(viii) reviewed a draft of the Agreement, dated February 6, 2018, which we have assumed is in substantially final form and from which

we assume the final form will not vary in any respect material to our analysis;
 

 (ix) performed such other analyses and examinations and considered such other factors that we deemed appropriate.

For purposes of our analysis and opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without undertaking any independent verification of, the accuracy
and completeness of all of the information publicly available, and all of the information supplied or otherwise made available to, discussed with, or
reviewed by us, and we assume no liability therefor. With respect to the projected financial data relating to the Company referred to above, we have
assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of management of
the Company as to the future financial performance of the Company. We express no view as to any projected financial data relating to the Company or
the assumptions on which they are based.

For purposes of rendering our opinion, we have assumed, in all respects material to our analysis, that the representations and warranties of each
party contained in the Agreement are true and correct, that each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it
under the Agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the Transaction will be satisfied without material waiver or modification thereof.
We have further assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents, approvals or releases necessary for the consummation of the Transaction
will be obtained without any material delay, limitation, restriction or condition that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the consummation
of the Transaction or materially reduce the benefits to the holders of the Company Common Stock of the Transaction.

We have not made nor assumed any responsibility for making any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company,
nor have we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company under any state or
federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Our opinion is necessarily based upon information made available to us as of the date
hereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they exist and as can be evaluated on the date hereof. It is understood that subsequent
developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

We have not been asked to pass upon, and express no opinion with respect to, any matter other than the fairness to the holders of the Company
Common Stock, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, the fairness of
the proposed transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other securities, creditors or other
constituencies of the Company, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors
or employees of the Company, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Consideration or otherwise. We have assumed that any modification
to the structure of the transaction will not vary in any respect material to our analysis. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Transaction
as compared to other business or financial strategies that might be available to the Company, nor does it address the underlying business decision of the
Company to engage in the Transaction. This letter, and our opinion, does not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors of the Company or
to any other persons in respect of the Transaction, including as to how any holder of shares of Company Common Stock should vote or act in respect of
the Transaction. We are not legal, regulatory, accounting or tax experts and have assumed the accuracy and completeness of assessments by the
Company and its advisors with respect to legal, regulatory, accounting and tax matters.

We will receive a fee for our services upon the rendering of this opinion. The Company has also agreed to reimburse our expenses and to
indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. We will also be entitled to receive a success fee if the Transaction is
consummated. Prior to this engagement, we, Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates, provided financial advisory services to the Company and had
received fees for the rendering of these services including the reimbursement of expenses. During the two year period prior to the date hereof, no
material relationship existed between Evercore Group L.L.C. and its affiliates and Parent pursuant to which compensation was received by Evercore
Group L.L.C. or its affiliates as a result of such a relationship. We may provide financial or other services to the Company or Parent in the future and in
connection with any such services we may receive compensation.

In the ordinary course of business, Evercore Group L.L.C. or its affiliates may actively trade the securities, or related derivative securities, or
financial instruments of the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates, for its own account and for the accounts of its customers and, accordingly,
may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or instruments.

This letter, and the opinion expressed herein is addressed to, and for the information and benefit of, the Board of Directors of the Company in
connection with their evaluation of the proposed Transaction. The issuance of this opinion has been approved by an Opinion Committee of Evercore
Group L.L.C.    Except to the extent permitted pursuant to the express terms of our engagement letter dated January 15, 2018, this opinion may not be
disclosed, quoted, referred or communicated (in whole or in part) to or by any third party for any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written
approval.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of the shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such Consideration.
 

Very truly yours,

EVERCORE GROUP L.L.C.

ANNEX II

[LETTERHEAD OF MACQUARIE CAPITAL (USA) INC.]

February 9, 2018

CSRA Inc.
3170 Fairview Park Drive
Falls Church, Virginia 22042
Attn: Board of Directors

Members of the Board of Directors:

Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. (“we” or “Macquarie”) understands that CSRA Inc. (the “Company”) intends to enter into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among the Company, General Dynamics Corporation (the “Acquiror”) and Red Hawk Enterprises Corp., a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, among other things (i) Merger Sub will commence an offer (the “Offer”)
to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Company Common Stock”), of the Company, at a price per
share of $40.75 (the “Consideration”) and (ii) regardless of whether shares of Company Common Stock are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer,
subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”) as a result of which each share of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger other than shares of Company Common Stock issued and
held or owned by the Company, the Acquiror, Merger Sub or any wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, the Acquiror or Merger Sub will be
converted into the right to receive the Consideration.

You have requested that Macquarie render its opinion to the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company (in its capacity as such) as to
whether, as of the date hereof, the Consideration to be received by the holders of Company Common Stock other than the Excluded Holders (as defined
below) in the Offer and/or the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For purposes of this
opinion, the term “Excluded Holders” means the Acquiror, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates.

In connection with this opinion, we have, among other things:

(i)    reviewed a draft, dated February 9, 2018 of the Merger Agreement;

(ii)    reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information regarding the Company;

(iii)    reviewed certain other financial and operating information relating to the Company furnished by management of the Company,
including financial projections prepared by the management of the Company relating to the Company for the fiscal years ending March 31, 2018
through March 31, 2023 (the “Company Projections”);

(iv)    reviewed certain estimates prepared by the management of the Company as to the tax savings expected by such management to be
achieved as a result of the amortization of certain assets of the Company (the “Estimated Tax Savings”);

(v)    discussed the Offer and the Merger and the business, operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company with members of
the management of the Company;

(vi)    reviewed certain financial and stock market data with respect to the Company and compared that data with similar data for other
companies with publicly traded equity securities that we deemed relevant;

(vii)    reviewed the publicly available financial terms of certain other business combinations and other transactions that we deemed relevant;
and

(viii)    performed such other financial analyses and considered such other information and factors that we deemed appropriate for purposes
of this opinion.

Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc.  
 

We have not undertaken any responsibility for independently verifying, and have not independently verified, any of the foregoing information and
we have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information. Management of the Company has advised us, and we have
assumed, that the Company Projections have been reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting such management’s best currently available
estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance and condition of the Company and the Estimated Tax Savings have been reasonably
prepared in good faith on bases reflecting such management’s best currently available estimates and judgments as to such tax savings, in each case
including the potential impact of recent changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations pursuant to the H.R. 1, Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on
December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”), on the future financial performance of the Company and such tax savings, as to which impact we
express no view or opinion. You have advised us and we have assumed that the Company Projections and the Estimated Tax Savings are a reasonable
basis on which to evaluate the Company and the Offer and the Merger and, at your direction, we have used and relied upon the Company Projections
and the Estimated Tax Savings for purposes of our analyses and opinion. We express no view or opinion as to the Company Projections or the Estimated
Tax Savings or the assumptions upon which they are based. We further note that (i) the actual and estimated financial and operating performance and the
share price data we reviewed for the companies with publicly traded equity securities that we deemed to be relevant and (ii) the financial terms of
certain other business combinations and other transactions that we deemed relevant might not, in whole or in part, reflect the potential impact of recent
changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Further, we have relied upon and assumed, without independent
verification, that there has been no change in the business, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects of the
Company since the respective dates of the most recent financial statements and other information, financial or otherwise, provided to us that would be
material to our analysis or opinion, and that there is no information or any facts that would make any of the information reviewed by us incomplete or
misleading. In connection with this opinion, we have not made, nor assumed any responsibility for making, any physical inspection, independent
evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such
evaluations or appraisals.

We have relied upon and assumed that the representations and warranties of each party in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that each
party will fully and timely perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement, that all of the
conditions to the consummation of the Offer and the Merger will be satisfied, and that the Offer and the Merger will be consummated in a timely manner
in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without waiver, modification or amendment of any terms or provisions thereof. We have
further assumed, with your consent, that the Offer and the Merger will be consummated in a manner that complies in all respects with all applicable
federal and state statutes, rules and regulations and that all governmental, regulatory, third-party and other consents, approvals or releases necessary for
the consummation of the Offer and the Merger will be obtained without any delay, limitation, restriction or condition (including the disposition of
businesses or assets) that would have an adverse effect on the Company or the contemplated benefits of the proposed Offer and the Merger. In addition,
we have assumed that the final form of the Merger Agreement will not differ from the draft of the Merger Agreement reviewed by us.

Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Board or the Company to effect the Offer and/or the Merger or the relative
merits of the Offer and/or the Merger as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions available to the Company. Our opinion is
necessarily based on information made available to us as of the date hereof and financial, economic, market and other conditions as they exist and can
be evaluated on the date hereof. We do not have any obligation to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw this opinion or to otherwise comment on or
consider events occurring or coming to our attention after the date hereof.

This opinion only addresses the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock other than the Excluded
Holders of the Consideration to be received by such holders in the Offer

and/or the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement and does not address any other aspect or implication of the Offer or the Merger or any agreement,
arrangement or understanding entered into in connection therewith or otherwise including, without limitation, (i) the form or structure of the Offer
and/or the Merger, or any portion thereof, and (ii) the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspect relating to, any compensation or
consideration to be paid or payable to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Offer or the Merger, or any class of such persons, relative
to the Consideration or otherwise. We are not providing any advice or opinion as to matters that require legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance,
executive compensation, tax or other similar professional advice. We have assumed that the Company has obtained or will obtain such advice or
opinions from appropriate professional sources. Furthermore, we have relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the assessments by the Company,
the Acquiror and their respective advisors with respect to all legal, regulatory, accounting, insurance, executive compensation and tax matters. We are
not expressing any opinion as to whether or not the Company, the Acquiror, its securityholders or any other party is receiving or paying reasonably
equivalent value in the Offer and/or the Merger, the solvency, creditworthiness or fair value of the Company or any other participant in the Offer and/or
the Merger, or any of their respective assets, under any applicable laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance or similar matters.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Offer and/or the Merger and will receive fees for our services, a portion
of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a significant portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the earlier of the
acceptance of shares of Company Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer and the Merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse
us for certain of our expenses and to indemnify us and certain related parties against certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. We have in the past
and may in the future seek to expand our business and commercial relationships with the Company, the Acquiror, any other company that may be
involved in the Offer and/or the Merger and their respective affiliates. In the ordinary course of business, Macquarie and its affiliates may acquire, hold,
sell or trade debt, equity and other securities and financial instruments (including derivatives, loans and other obligations) of the Company, the Acquiror,
any other company that may be involved in the Offer and/or the Merger and their respective affiliates, for its and their own accounts and for the accounts
of its and their customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or financial instruments. We and our affiliates
provide a wide range of investment banking advice and services, including financial advisory services, securities underwritings and placements,
securities sales and trading, brokerage advice and services, and loans.

It is understood that this opinion is for the information and use of the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the
Offer and/or the Merger. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board, the Company, the holders of Company Common Stock or any
other person as to how to act or vote with respect to any matter relating to the Offer or the Merger including whether or not to tender shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Offer.    The issuance of this opinion has been approved by an internal committee of Macquarie authorized to review
opinions of this nature.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Consideration to be received by the holders of Company
Common Stock other than the Excluded Holders in the Offer and/or the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view,
to such holders.

use the terms “us,” “we,” and “our” to refer to the Company. You are receiving this Information Statement in connection with the possible appointment
of persons designated by Purchaser without a meeting of the Company’s stockholders to a majority of the seats on the Company’s board of directors (the
“Board”). Such designation would be made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 9, 2018, by and among the Company,
Parent and Purchaser (as such agreement may be amended or supplemented from time to time in accordance with its terms, the “Merger Agreement”).

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Purchaser commenced a cash tender offer on March 5, 2018 to purchase all Shares that are issued and
outstanding, at a price of $40.75 in cash, without interest (the “Offer Price”) and less any applicable withholding taxes, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, dated March 5, 2018 (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Offer to Purchase”),
and the related letter of transmittal and letter of instruction (as they may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the “Letter of Transmittal” and
the “Letter of Instruction”, respectively). The Offer is described in a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (as amended or supplemented from time to
time, the “Schedule TO”), filed by Parent and Purchaser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 5, 2018.

The Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that as soon as practicable following the completion of the Offer and satisfaction or waiver
of the remaining applicable conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Purchaser will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the
Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger Agreement also provides that the Merger may be consummated regardless of
whether the Offer is completed; however, if the Offer is not completed or if the Offer is completed but if Purchaser does not own one Share more than
90% of the number of Shares on a fully diluted basis that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all Shares subject to an option to
purchase “top-up” Shares under the Merger Agreement, the Merger may only be consummated after the Company’s stockholders holding a majority of
the total voting power of the outstanding Shares have approved the Merger Agreement and the other applicable conditions to the Merger have been
satisfied or waived. Under no circumstances will interest be paid on the Offer Price for Shares, regardless of any extension of the Offer or delay in
making payments for Shares. At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each outstanding Share (other than Shares (i) held by General
Dynamics, the Company, Purchaser or their respective subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) with respect to which the holder has
exercised and perfected appraisal or dissenters’ rights, if any, and has not voted in favor of or consented in writing to the Merger and (iii) in respect of
stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units) will be canceled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, net of
applicable withholding taxes and without interest.

independent directors must remain on the Board. The Company has agreed that, at the request of Purchaser, the Company will promptly take all actions
as are necessary (other than seeking the resignation of the Chief Executive Officer from the Board) to enable the designees of Purchaser to be elected or

designated by Parent to constitute the number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, of each committee of the Board and the board of
directors (or similar governing body) of each subsidiary of the Company (and each committee thereof) that represents the same percentage as such
individuals represent on the Board, in each case only to the extent permitted by U.S. federal securities laws, the listing requirements of the New York

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

CSRA is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance, which we believe is essential for sustained success and long-term
stockholder value. In light of this goal, the Board oversees, counsels and directs management in the long-term interests of CSRA and our stockholders.
The Board’s responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
 

 •  overseeing the management of our business and the assessment of our business risks;
 

 
•  overseeing the processes for maintaining the integrity of our financial statements and other public disclosures, and compliance with law and

ethics;
 

 •  reviewing and approving our major financial objectives and strategic and operating plans, and other significant actions; and
 

 •  overseeing our talent management and succession planning.

The Board discharges its responsibilities through regularly scheduled meetings as well as telephonic meetings, action by written consent and other
communications with management as appropriate. CSRA expects directors to attend all meetings of the Board and the Board committees upon which
they serve, and all annual meetings of CSRA’s stockholders at which they are standing for election or re-election as directors. During fiscal year 2017,
the Board held nine meetings. During fiscal year 2017, the Audit Committee held nine meetings, the Compensation Committee held eight meetings, the
Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee held five meetings and the Executive Committee held 14 meetings. No director attended fewer than 75%
of the aggregate of (1) the total number of meetings of the Board, and (2) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which he
or she served during fiscal year 2017.

Governance is a continuing focus at CSRA, starting with the Board and extending to all employees. We solicit feedback from our stockholders on
governance and executive compensation practices and engage in discussions with various groups and individuals on governance issues and
improvements. In this section, we describe some of our key governance policies and practices.

THE BOARD

Corporate Governance Guidelines

The Board adheres to governance principles designed to promote excellence in the execution of its duties, and reviews CSRA’s governance
policies and practices regularly. These principles are outlined in CSRA’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, which, in conjunction with our Amended
and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), Code of Business Conduct (“Code of Conduct”), Board
committee charters, and related policies, form the framework for the governance of CSRA.

The full text of our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the charters for each of our Board committees, and our Code of Conduct are available on
our Website, www.CSRA.com, under “Corporate Governance.” These materials are also available in print to any person, without charge, upon request,

Board Leadership Structure

Board Leadership Structure:
 

 •  Separate non-executive Chair and CEO roles

Table of Contents

 •  Strong committee Chairs
 •  Active engagement by all directors
 •  Nine of eleven directors independent

The Board believes that this structure provides effective oversight of management.

Our directors have determined that it is in the best interests of the stockholders of CSRA to separate the roles of Chairman and CEO. Our Board
believes that a non-executive Chair who knows and understands our business gives our Board a strong leadership and corporate governance structure. In
addition, separating the roles of Chairman and CEO creates clear and unambiguous lines of authority. This strong counterbalancing structure allows the
Board to focus on corporate governance and oversight and the CEO to focus on CSRA’s business.

Our non-executive Chair has the following duties and responsibilities, as detailed in the Board’s Corporate Governance Guidelines:
 

 •  preside at annual and special meetings of the stockholders;
 

 •  preside at Board meetings;
 

 •  preside over executive sessions of independent directors;
 

 •  organize and present the agenda for regular and special Board meetings in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer and other directors;
 

 
•  serve as a focal point for management to inform the Board, ensuring the proper flow of information to the Board by maintaining close

contact with and supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management, including ongoing monitoring of the
performance of the Company against strategic, operational and other objectives set by the Board;

 

 •  lead Board reviews of the performance of the Chief Executive Officer and other key senior managers;
 

 
•  work with the Nominating and Governance Committee to develop guidelines for the conduct of directors and to advise in making

recommendations to the Board regarding director candidates;
 

 
•  work with the Nominating and Governance Committee to determine standing and ad hoc committees, committee structure and charters,

committee assignments and committee chairpersons;
 

 •  chair the Executive Committee;
 

 •  attend committee meetings of each standing committee of the Board as deemed appropriate;
 

 
•  assist in representing the Company to external groups, including customers, vendors, stockholders, as well as governmental and

non-governmental bodies; and
 

 •  recommend outside advisors and consultants that report to the Board on Board-wide issues.

Our non-executive chair also calls and presides at meetings of the non-employee directors (executive sessions) as appropriate. CSRA’s governance
processes include such executive sessions after Board meetings, annual evaluations of the CEO’s performance, succession planning, annual Board and
committee self-assessments, and other governance processes contained in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the Board committee charters.

Director Independence

Independent Directors. The Board assesses the independence of our directors and examines the nature and extent of any relationships between
CSRA and our directors, their families and their affiliates. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a director is “independent” if he or she
satisfies the NYSE requirements for

Table of Contents

director independence and the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with CSRA (either directly, or as a partner,
stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with CSRA). In fiscal year 2017, the Board determined that nine of our directors—Sanju
K. Bansal, Michèle A. Flournoy, Mark A. Frantz, Nancy Killefer, Craig L. Martin, Sean O’Keefe, Michael E. Ventling, Billie I. Williamson, and John F.
Young—are independent.

Non-Management Director Meetings. The non-management directors meet in executive session after the conclusion of each regularly scheduled
Board meeting, and meet at such additional times as they may determine.

Committee Independence Requirements. All members serving on the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating/Corporate
Governance Committee must be independent or otherwise be eligible to be a committee member under Section 303A of the NYSE Listed Company
Manual. In addition, each Audit Committee member must meet heightened independence criteria under the rules and regulations of the NYSE and the
SEC relating to audit committees, and each Compensation Committee member must meet heightened independence criteria under the rules and
regulations of the NYSE and the SEC relating to compensation committees, be a “non-employee director” pursuant to the Exchange Act and an “outside
director” for purposes of Section 162(m).

Oversight of Risk Management

We believe our Board leadership structure supports a risk-management process in which senior management is responsible for our day-to-day risk-
management processes and the Board provides oversight of our risk management. As part of its oversight responsibility, the Board oversees and
maintains CSRA’s governance and compliance processes and procedures to promote high standards of responsibility, ethics, and integrity.

Management Role. In order for CSRA to identify and mitigate CSRA’s risk exposures, our Internal Audit function facilitates an Enterprise Risk
Management (ERM) review to (1) identify risks in the strategic, operational, financial reporting and compliance domains, for CSRA as a whole, as well
as for each operating unit, and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of existing mitigation strategies. Internal Audit reports to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
and the Audit Committee and coordinates and reviews assessments of internal processes and controls for ongoing compliance with internal policies and
controls. Internal Audit periodically reports potential areas of risk to the Board and its committees.

Board Role. The Board has overall responsibility for oversight of risk and assesses our strategic and operational risks throughout the year on an
ongoing basis. Members of senior management regularly report on the opportunities and risks faced by CSRA in the markets in which CSRA conducts
business.

Committee Role. In fulfilling its oversight role, the Board delegates certain risk management oversight responsibility to the Board’s committees.
The committees meet regularly and report any significant issues and recommendations discussed during the committee meetings to the Board.
Specifically, each committee fulfills the following oversight roles:
 

 

•  The Audit Committee oversees risks related to accounting, financial reporting processes and internal controls of CSRA. The Audit
Committee also reviews CSRA’s policies and practices with respect to risk assessment and risk management. As a part of its review, the
Audit Committee and management discuss CSRA’s major risk exposures and the steps that management has taken to monitor and control
such exposures. The Audit Committee then reports the results of its review to the Board.

 

 
•  The Compensation Committee monitors the risks associated with succession planning and leadership development as well as compensation

plans, including evaluating the effect that CSRA’s compensation plans may have on decision making.
 

 
•  The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee monitors the risks related to CSRA’s governance structure and process. The

Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for developing

and implementing a director evaluation program to measure the individual and collective performance of directors and the fulfillment of
their responsibilities to our stockholders, including an assessment of the Board’s compliance with applicable corporate governance
requirements and identification of areas in which the Board might improve its performance. The Nominating/Corporate Governance
Committee is also responsible for overseeing an annual self-evaluation process for the Board and each of its committees designed to assure
that directors contribute to our corporate governance and to our performance. These tasks are accomplished in part through our annual
Board evaluation.

Compensation and Risk

During fiscal year 2017, CSRA management reviewed its executive and non-executive compensation programs and determined that none of its
compensation programs encourages or creates unnecessary risk taking, and none is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on CSRA. In
conducting this assessment, CSRA inventoried its executive and non-executive plans and programs and analyzed the components and design features of
these programs in the context of risk mitigation. A summary of the findings of the assessment was provided to the Compensation Committee, the Audit
Committee, and the Board. Overall, CSRA concluded that (1) CSRA’s executive compensation programs provide a mix of awards with performance
criteria and design features that mitigate excessive risk taking; (2) non-executive employee (non-sales) arrangements are primarily fixed compensation
(salary and benefits) with limited incentive opportunity and do not encourage excessive risk taking; and (3) sales force incentive compensation plans
moderate risk by using metrics that focus on driving sales growth, but not at the expense of profitability. CSRA also considered its robust executive
stock ownership guidelines, clawback provisions and anti-hedging policy as risk mitigating features of its executive compensation program.

Talent Management and Succession Planning

CSRA’s Compensation Committee and Board engage annually in a review of succession plans. The annual review focuses on emerging talent and
key positions at the executive officer and operating unit leadership level that are important to the execution of CSRA’s strategic priorities and are critical
to achieving CSRA’s business goals. The Compensation Committee is also updated on issues relating to the overall workforce such as diversity, health
and welfare benefits, performance management, turnover, attrition, and engagement.

Director Education

The Board recognizes the importance of its members keeping current on Company and industry issues and their responsibilities as directors. All
new directors attend orientation training soon after being elected to the Board. Also, the Board expects that directors will attend continuing education
programs for Board members, which may include internal strategy or topical meetings, third-party presentations, and externally offered programs.

Code of Ethics and Standards of Conduct

CSRA is committed to high standards of ethical conduct and professionalism. CSRA’s Code of Conduct, which applies to all CSRA directors,
officers, and employees, confirms our commitment to ethical behavior in all CSRA activities. The Code of Conduct sets forth our policies and
expectations on such topics as confidentiality, insider trading, conflicts of interest, protection of CSRA and customer property, and creating a proper and
professional work environment. We expect everyone associated with our Company — including our directors, officers, employees, suppliers, and other
third-parties with whom we do business — to operate ethically and to lead with integrity. CSRA’s Ethics and Compliance Office (“ECO”) maintains a
toll-free and Internet-based helpline — the CSRA OpenLine — that employees can use to communicate any ethics-related concerns. The ECO reviews
and investigates all concerns. CSRA also provides training for all employees on ethics and compliance issues.

Table of Contents

In fiscal year 2017, there were no waivers of any provisions of the Code of Conduct for the CEO, CFO, or Controller. If CSRA were to amend or
waive any provision of the Code of Conduct applicable to our CEO, CFO, and Controller that relates to any element of the definition of “code of ethics”
enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, CSRA intends to disclose these actions on the CSRA website.

Board Diversity

The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing and assessing with the Board the appropriate skills, experience,
and background sought for Board members in the context of our business and then-current membership on the Board. This assessment of Board skills,
experience, and background includes numerous diverse factors including independence, experience, age and gender, and ethnic diversity. In addition, the
Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee seeks to maintain a mix of individuals who possess experience in the sectors in which CSRA operates,
such as technology, government service, and public policy, as well as those having backgrounds as executives in operations, finance, accounting,
marketing, and sales. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee deems these practices to be effective.

Mandatory Retirement and Resignation of Directors

Under our Bylaws, a director must retire by the close of the first annual meeting of stockholders held after he or she reaches age 72, unless the
Board determines that it is in the best interests of CSRA and its stockholders for the director to continue to serve until the close of a subsequent annual
meeting.

Under the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the CEO must offer to resign from the Board when he or she ceases to be a CSRA employee.

Communicating with the Board or the Chair

Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Board, individual directors, the directors as a group, or with the
non-executive Chairman by writing in care of the Corporate Secretary, CSRA Inc., 3170 Fairview Park Drive, Falls Church, Virginia 22042. The
Corporate Secretary reviews all submissions and forwards to members of the Board all appropriate communications that in his judgment are not
offensive or otherwise objectionable and do not constitute commercial solicitations.

COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD

As of the date of this Information Statement, the Board has four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the
Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, and the Executive Committee.

Each director serving on the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, or Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee must be independent.
In addition:
 

 

•  Each Audit Committee member must meet heightened independence criteria under the rules and regulations of the NYSE and
the SEC relating to audit committees, and must be financially literate. No member of the Audit Committee may
simultaneously serve on the audit committees of more than three public companies unless the Board determines that such
simultaneous service would not impair the member’s ability to serve effectively on the Audit Committee.

 

 
•  The Board has determined that each current member of the Audit Committee qualifies as an “audit committee financial

expert” for purposes of the rules of the SEC, and each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate.
 

 
•  Each Compensation Committee member must meet heightened independence criteria under the rules and regulations of the

NYSE and SEC relating to compensation committees, be a

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors consists of three directors. The Board has determined that each member is financially literate, and
each of the members is designated as a “financial expert” as defined by the SEC. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the
Board of Directors. It is available on CSRA’s website at www.CSRA.com. The Audit Committee annually reviews its written charter and

Table of Contents

workplan. The Audit Committee has determined that its charter and practices are consistent with the listing standards of the NYSE and the provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

The Board of Directors has the ultimate authority for effective corporate governance, including oversight of the management of CSRA. The Audit
Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities by overseeing CSRA’s accounting, auditing and financial reporting processes, internal
controls, financial risk exposures, and for monitoring compliance with certain regulatory and legal requirements. The Audit Committee regularly reports
to the full Board. For a summary of the responsibilities of the Audit Committee, see also “Corporate Governance—Committees of the Board” in this
Information Statement.

The Audit Committee relies on the expertise and knowledge of management, the internal auditor, and the independent auditor in carrying out its
oversight responsibilities. CSRA management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of CSRA’s financial statements, the financial reporting
process, including evaluating the effectiveness of CSRA’s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit
Committee’s responsibility is to monitor and review these processes. It is not the Audit Committee’s duty or responsibility to conduct auditing or
accounting reviews or procedures. In addition, management has responsibility for the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

CSRA’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”), is responsible for performing an independent audit of
CSRA’s annual consolidated and combined financial statements, expressing an opinion on the conformity of the financial statements with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, and expressing an opinion as to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the
Standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”).

In the course of fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit Committee:
 

 
•  reviewed and discussed with management and Deloitte CSRA’s quarterly earnings press releases, consolidated and combined financial

statements, related periodic reports filed with the SEC and related matters;
 

 
•  reviewed and discussed with management, the internal auditor, and Deloitte, as appropriate, the audit scopes and plans of both the internal

auditor and Deloitte;
 

 
•  inquired about significant business and financial reporting risks, reviewed CSRA’s policies for risk assessment and risk management, and

assessed the steps management is taking to control these risks, including cyber security and fraud deterrence;
 

 
•  met in periodic executive sessions with each of management, the internal auditor, and Deloitte, to discuss the results of their examinations,

their evaluations of internal controls, and the overall quality of CSRA’s financial reporting;
 

 
•  met with the CFO and Principal Accounting Officer and other members of management, separately and as a group, to discuss various

financial matters and the Company’s systems of internal control over financial reporting;
 

 •  received reports about the receipt, retention, and treatment of financial reporting and other compliance concerns;
 

 •  reviewed and assessed the qualitative aspects of CSRA’s ethics and compliance programs;
 

 
•  reviewed with the General Counsel and the Ethics and Compliance Officer legal and regulatory matters that may have a material impact on

the consolidated and combined financial statements or internal control over financial reporting;
 

 
•  met with the internal auditor and Deloitte to discuss any matters that the internal auditor, Deloitte, or the Audit Committee believed should

be discussed privately without members of management present;

Table of Contents

 
•  reviewed and discussed with Deloitte the matters required to be communicated pursuant to PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301,

Communications with Audit Committees;
 

 
•  received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from Deloitte required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding

Deloitte’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and had discussions with Deloitte about its independence;
and

 

 
•  reviewed and discussed with management and Deloitte CSRA’s audited Consolidated and Combined financial statements and related

footnotes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, and the independent auditor’s report on those financial statements.

Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, and subject to the limitations of the Audit Committee’s role and responsibilities referred
to above and in the Audit Committee charter, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, that CSRA’s audited
Consolidated and Combined financial statements referred to above be included in CSRA’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2017 for filing with the SEC.

The independent auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee is responsible for retaining the independent registered
public accounting firm and for pre-approving all audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditor. During the
pre-approval process, the Audit Committee considers the impact of the types of services and the related fees on the independence of the independent
auditor. In determining whether to reappoint Deloitte, the Audit Committee considered various factors, including, but not limited to:
 

 •  the quality and candor of Deloitte’s communication and its interaction with the Audit Committee and management;
 

 •  the sufficiency of resources provided by Deloitte;
 

 •  Deloitte’s knowledge of our business, accounting policies and practices, and internal control over financial reporting;
 

 •  Deloitte’s independence and objectivity;
 

 •  the performance of Deloitte on the audit;
 

 •  the professional qualifications of Deloitte;
 

 
•  the appropriateness of Deloitte’s fees, taking into account the size and level of complexity of our organization and the resources necessary to

perform the audit; and
 

 •  the advisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent public accounting firm.

As a result of its evaluation, the Audit Committee concluded that Deloitte is independent and that the selection of Deloitte as CSRA’s independent
registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending March 30, 2018 (“fiscal year 2018”) is in the best interests of CSRA and its stockholders,
and recommended to the Board that such appointment be submitted to CSRA’s stockholders for ratification.

Each non-employee director received an annual equity retainer grant of RSUs on August 12, 2016. The number of RSUs granted was determined
by dividing the applicable retainer amount ($200,000 for Mrs. Killefer and $160,000 for the other directors) by the closing price of our common stock
on August 12, 2016 and rounding the quotient to the nearest 100 shares. This resulted in grants of 7,700 RSUs to Mrs. Killefer and 6,200 RSUs to each
other director. These RSUs vested on August 8, 2017.

Mr. Martin, who joined the board on March 15, 2016, received an additional 2,300 RSUs during fiscal year 2017. These RSUs reflect the prorated
portion of his fiscal year 2016 award and vested in August 2016.

EQUITY OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES

Under stock ownership guidelines adopted by the Board, Board members other than the CEO are required to hold a number of CSRA shares
having a value equal to at least five times the amount of the non-executive director annual cash retainer fee. Non-executive directors are required to
accumulate this number of shares over a three-year period. Restricted stock units are taken into account for purposes of determining whether these
requirements have been met. Stock ownership guidelines for the executive officers, including the CEO, are described under “Executive Compensation–
Additional Compensation Policies–Equity Ownership Guidelines.”

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of our common stock by:
 

 •  each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock;
 

 •  each of our directors;
 

 •  each of our NEOs; and
 

 •  all of our directors and executive officers as a group.

The SEC has defined “beneficial ownership” of a security to mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of voting power or investment power over
such security. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of our common
stock subject to options or other rights held by that person that are exercisable or will become exercisable within 60 days are deemed outstanding, while
such shares are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing percentage ownership of any other

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires CSRA directors and executive officers to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of
changes in ownership of CSRA common stock and other equity securities of CSRA. Executive officers and directors are required by SEC regulations to
furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.

To our knowledge, based solely on a review of information furnished to us, reports filed through us, and representations that no other reports were
required, all of our executive officers and directors filed the reports required under Section 16(a) on a timely basis for the fiscal year ended March 31,
2017, except that Messrs. Deutsch, Luebke and Prior and Ms. Sullivan filed reports late relating to equity grants that vested in May 2016.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED-PERSON TRANSACTIONS

Policy and Procedures Governing Related-Person Transactions

Our Board has adopted a written policy requiring the approval by the Audit Committee of all transactions in excess of $120,000 between CSRA
and any related person. Under this policy, a “related person” is any:
 

 
•  person who is or was (since the beginning of the last fiscal year for which CSRA filed a Form 10-K and proxy statement, even if such

person does not currently serve in that role) an executive officer, director, or nominee for election as a director of CSRA;
 

 
•  any person known by CSRA to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of CSRA’s voting securities at the time when a

transaction in which such person had a direct or indirect material interest occurred or existed; or
 

 •  an immediate family member of either of the foregoing.

An “executive officer” for this purpose is any person subject to the provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. An “immediate family member”
is any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, or
any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of a person.

Table of Contents

A transaction includes, but is not limited to, any financial transaction, arrangement, or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of
indebtedness), or any series of similar transactions, arrangements, or relationships. In determining whether to approve an interested transaction, the
Audit Committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the interested transaction is on terms no less favorable than
terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party’s interest in the
transaction. No director will participate in any discussion or approval of an interested transaction for which he or she (or an immediate family member)
is a related party, except that the director will provide all material information concerning the interested transaction to the Audit Committee.

Our Audit Committee has determined certain categories of related-person transactions will be deemed to have been reviewed in advance and
pre-approved by the Audit Committee, even if the aggregate amount involved will exceed $120,000, including transactions with another company with a
value that does not exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of the other company’s annual revenues, where the related person’s only relationship is as a
director or beneficial holder of less than 10% of the other company’s equity interests.

Our Board has delegated to the Chair of the Audit Committee or, if the Chair of the Audit Committee is not independent, the Chair of the Board
(and if the Chair of the Board is not independent, the lead independent director), the authority to pre-approve or ratify, any related-person transaction, in
which the aggregate amount involved is expected to be equal to or less than $1,000,000.

There were no material related party transactions during fiscal year 2017 and no transactions were considered or reviewed in connection with this
policy.

Executive Summary

Compensation Overview

As a relatively new publicly traded company, we have tailored our Executive Compensation program to align with the market and industry. We
have a “pay for performance” philosophy designed to attract and retain critical executive talent and to provide our executives with the appropriate
incentives to manage the Company in our stockholders’ interests.

We conduct a benchmarking analysis each year to determine competitive base salaries, annual cash incentives, and long-term incentive
opportunities. Our program also includes post-employment, severance, and perquisite benefit programs.

The Compensation Committee will continue to review and monitor our executive compensation programs and may make adjustments it deems
appropriate to ensure that the programs provide our executives with an appropriate mix of market-competitive compensation opportunities.

Each year, at the Company’s annual meeting, stockholders have the opportunity to cast an advisory vote to approve our executive compensation
program. This vote is commonly referred to as a “say-on-pay” vote. Our Compensation Committee considers the outcome of the stockholder advisory
vote when making decisions related to the compensation of our NEOs and our executive compensation program design, structure and policies.

At our 2016 annual meeting, the favorable voting result on our executive compensation program was 95.1%. This voting result suggests strong
stockholder support for the philosophy, design and structure of our executive compensation program. Nevertheless, as noted below under the heading
“Fiscal Year 2018 Long-Term Incentive Compensation,” the Compensation Committee approved several changes to the Long-Term Incentive
Compensation program for fiscal year 2018 to enhance the competitiveness of the plan and respond to certain concerns raised by external proxy
advisors. The Committee will continue to consider the results of the shareholders’ advisory votes on executive compensation when making decisions
about our executive compensation program.

CEO Compensation Overview

In December 2016, the Committee entered into a 3-year employment agreement with Mr. Prior (the “CEO Employment Agreement”). In
connection with entering into this agreement, and after consideration of market data provided by the Committee’s independent consultant, the
Committee set Mr. Prior’s base salary at $950,000 and his target annual incentive opportunity at 125% of base salary. In addition, the Committee
awarded Mr. Prior a restricted stock unit award valued at $2,250,000 at the time of grant. The RSU award will vest 50% on the second anniversary of the
grant date and 50% on the third anniversary of the grant date. The purpose of this award was to provide Mr. Prior with a meaningful stake in our
Company and to foster his long-term retention and alignment of interests with those of our stockholders.

Perquisites and Benefits

  

Limited perquisites and health and welfare

Provide benefits consistent with competitive
practice and enhance executive work

The Compensation Committee makes decisions regarding each element of Total Direct Compensation. Since our focus is on performance, the
Compensation Committee does not consider aggregate amounts earned or benefits accumulated by an executive from prior CSRA service as a
significant factor in making compensation decisions. To assess the competitiveness of the Total Direct Compensation opportunity and each of its
elements for our NEOs, these elements are compared to the market median for similarly situated executives in companies against which we compete for
executive talent. Please see “Compensation Framework – Review of Market Compensation Data” below for a discussion of our peer group and other
data used to assess the competitive market.

The market competitiveness of our pay opportunities is just one factor that the Compensation Committee reviews when evaluating our executive
compensation programs. Additional factors may include the Company’s performance (including its strategy and management’s performance in
executing that strategy) and individual factors such as the NEO’s level of responsibility, experience, succession potential and individual performance.

Base Salary

General. Base salary is the only fixed component of our NEOs’ compensation and constitutes less than half of each NEO’s Total Direct
Compensation. Base salary is determined based on the level of responsibility assumed by an executive, experience, performance, and competitive pay
practices. Base salary adjustment decisions also consider promotions, changes in responsibilities, performance, succession potential, Company merit pay
budgets, and market trends. At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee reviews the base salary for each NEO and determines
any base salary adjustments. The Compensation Committee also considers how base salary adjustments affect annual cash incentive opportunities and
target long-term incentive grant values, which are established as a percentage of base salary. The Compensation Committee exercises a slight bias
towards a heavier weight on incentive compensation as a percentage of competitive target Total Direct Compensation.

Fiscal Year 2017 Base Salary Increases. Following Board review and approval, Mr. Keffer’s annual base salary was increased from $425,000 to
$525,000, effective May 16, 2016, to better align his annual base salary with that of other CFO positions in our peer group. In addition, the Board
approved an increase in Mr. Prior’s annual base salary from $825,000 to $950,000 effective December 24, 2016 in connection with the execution of his
employment contract.

Fiscal Year 2017 Base Salary Table

Annual Cash Incentives

Each of our NEOs participated in the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the “EICP”) during fiscal year 2017. The EICP is an annual cash
incentive plan, which is designed to take into account a variety of factors, including Company financial performance, the NEO’s contribution to the
achievement of the Company’s strategic goals, the NEO’s individual performance, and client satisfaction. Therefore, EICP awards are directly linked to
Company and individual performance.

Target EICP Awards. The Compensation Committee establishes a target award percentage for each NEO who participates in the EICP. The target
award value is equal to the target award percentage multiplied by the NEO’s base salary. Each NEO’s target award value is established in consideration
of market practices, individual scope of responsibility and expected contribution.

Fiscal Year 2017 Target EICP Award Table. The table below reflects the fiscal year 2017 target award percentage, the corresponding target award
value, and the target award value as a percentage of target Total Direct Compensation, in each case, as of fiscal year-end.

Paul Nedzbala    100%   400,000    33% 

How the EICP Works. EICP awards are earned based on performance relative to targeted financial goals and strategic objectives. Awards are
subject to further discretionary modifications for individual performance. For fiscal year 2017 EICP awards, the financial goals were weighted 90% and
the strategic objectives were weighted 10%.

For each financial performance measure, the Compensation Committee establishes a threshold, target and stretch goal. Performance at the
threshold level generally corresponds to a 90% achievement percentage, performance at the target level corresponds to a 100% achievement percentage,
and performance at or above the stretch level corresponds to a 110% achievement percentage. Achievement percentages are interpolated on a straight-
line basis for performance between these performance levels. The maximum achievement percentage, with respect to any measure, is 110%, and, in
general, there is no payout, with respect to any measure, for performance below the threshold level.

In order to emphasize profitability, the Company must achieve at least 90% of its Adjusted EBITDA target before any funding is available. The
weighted financial performance measure is determined by calculating the percentage of the financial goal achieved by their respective weightings. The
Compensation Committee, in its discretion, also evaluates the Company’s performance against a set of strategic objectives that account for 10% of the
plan’s weightings and assigns a final score that ranges from 0% to 200%. The weighted financial performance measure plus the strategic objectives
score results in the final company score.

EICP award payouts are determined by multiplying each NEO’s target award value by the final company score and by their individual
performance score.

Special rules apply for executives who are subject to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. If the Company achieves 90% of its Adjusted
EBITDA target for the year, each executive subject to Section 162(m) becomes eligible to receive the maximum EICP payout. However, to ensure the
EICP operates the same way for all executives, the Compensation Committee then exercises “negative discretion” to reduce the executive’s EICP

Fiscal Year 2017 Strategic Objectives. Management also recommends a set of strategic objectives for review and evaluation by the Compensation
Committee and approval by the Board. These goals are intended to emphasize critical components of the Company’s strategy. For fiscal year 2017, these
objectives included achievement of the merger cost synergy case, successful completion of integration activities, achievement of stated net-promoter
score, and advancing the Company’s strategy to provide “Next Gen” services through leveraging our capabilities with strategic partners.

The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, determined that the strategic objectives for fiscal year 2017 EICP were achieved at 200% based
on the Company’s achievement with respect to the fiscal year 2017 objectives. Key accomplishments included achievement of the merger cost synergy
case, successful completion of several integration milestones, a net promoter score well in excess of the target, establishment of preferred partnerships
with key Next Gen Partners as well as the negotiation of a favorable IP matters agreement with CSC, successfully meeting our ITC hiring objectives for
the fiscal year through outstanding leadership and collaboration, the establishment of a new presence in the market through the launch of our new brand
and media campaign, and improved program performance across the Company.

Company Scores. The final weighted financial and strategic objectives scores for fiscal year 2017 resulted in a Company Score of 95%.

Individual Performance Adjustments. Each NEO completed a self-evaluation based on performance against fiscal year 2017 goals, impact of
contributions to the Company, and personal development as a leader. Each NEO was rated as having High Impact, Solid Impact, Adequate Impact or
Insufficient Impact. Our CEO provided feedback and ratings to each member of the executive leadership team, and the Compensation Committee did the
same for our CEO. In each case, individual performance was assessed against goals. In addition, retention considerations were taken into account, and
Pearl Meyer provided competitive peer group market data that was also considered in determining the final personal scores. The resulting personal
scores, which ranged from 1.00 to 1.20 for the NEOs, were then applied to the award calculations to determine the fiscal year 2017 EICP payouts for
each NEO.

Fiscal Year 2017 EICP Payouts. The results of the Compensation Committee’s final determinations regarding both the company score and
personal scores are reflected in the actual incentive paid to each executive for fiscal year 2017, as listed below.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation

General. Long-term incentive (“LTI”) compensation is the largest component of executive compensation for our NEOs. For fiscal year 2017, our
regular cycle LTI awards continued to consist of grants of service-based stock options (“Stock Options”), weighted 40%, and performance-based
restricted stock units (“Performance Share Units” or “PSUs”) with a three-year performance cycle, weighted 60%.

At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee establishes a target LTI grant value for each NEO, expressed as a percentage of
base salary, and the relative mix of award types. Individual target LTI grant values are determined in light of market practices, and actual award levels
reflect individual performance and succession potential. The Compensation Committee follows a similar process for new executives who join the
Company during the fiscal year.

Fiscal Year 2017 Target LTI Percentage Increases. In order to provide competitive, market driven compensation, Mr. Prior’s target LTI percentage
was increased from 400% to 500% of annual base salary effective May 16, 2016.

Stock Options. Stock Options, which comprise 40% of each NEO’s target LTI award, provide value to executives only if the market value of our
common stock appreciates over time. The exercise price for each Stock Option is the closing price of our common stock on the grant date. One-third of
the Stock Options vest and become exercisable on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date.

Performance Share Units. Performance Share Units, which comprise 60% of each NEO’s target LTI award, provide an opportunity for our
executives to earn common stock if targeted performance goals are met over a three-year performance period. Performance is measured based on the
Company’s Adjusted diluted Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) and Free Cash Flow (“FCF”). The Compensation Committee believes that EPS and FCF, aside
from being key measures of stockholder value, serve as important measures of our financial performance in light of the Company’s multi-year strategy.
For each award, EPS and FCF performance are measured over the last year in the three-year performance period. The Compensation Committee
establishes threshold, target and maximum EPS and FCF goals, at which 50%, 100% and 200%, respectively, of the target PSUs may vest. Vesting is
interpolated for EPS and FCF performance between these goals. No PSUs vest if EPS and FCF performance are below the threshold goals.

In addition, each award provided in fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017 offers an opportunity for accelerated vesting based on performance in the
first and second years of the performance period, in order to motivate progress toward multi-year goals.

EPS was the only performance metric in the plan for the fiscal year 2016 grant. Our EPS for that year equaled or exceeded the threshold EPS goal
for the award, providing for 25% of the target PSUs to vest at the end of the first year of the performance period. In the second year of the performance
period (fiscal year 2017), 25% of the target PSUs were eligible to vest at the end of the performance period if our EPS for that year equaled or exceeded
the 75th percentile of the EPS target. However, the Company did not achieve that performance milestone. At the end of the third year in the performance
period (fiscal year 2018), the Company will assess the final results to determine if any further vesting has been earned.

In our fiscal year 2017 grant, the Company adopted both EPS and FCF as the performance measures for the plan. If our EPS for the first year of
the performance period equals or exceeds the threshold EPS goal for the award, 12.5% of the target PSUs may vest at the end of the first year of the
performance period. Similarly, if our FCF for that year equals or exceeds the threshold FCF goal for the award, 12.5% of the target PSUs may vest at the
end of the first year of the performance period. In addition, 12.5% of the target PSUs may vest at the end of the second year of the performance period if
our EPS for that year equals or exceeds the threshold EPS goal (if not achieved after year one) or if our EPS performance for the second year equals or
exceeds the EPS goal at which 75% of the target PSUs vest (if partial vesting occurred after year one). Similarly, 12.5% of the target PSUs may vest at
the end of the second year of the performance period if our FCF for that year equals or exceeds the threshold FCF goal (if not achieved after year one) or
if our FCF performance for the second year equals or exceeds the FCF goal at which 75% of the target PSUs vest (if partial vesting occurred after year
one). Up to

Table of Contents

200% of the target PSUs, less any PSUs which vested in years one or two, may vest at the end of the third year of the performance period, half of which
are subject to our EPS performance and half of which subject to our FCF performance for that year. The threshold EPS goal achievement of $2.09 in
year one would have delivered 12.5% vesting. The threshold FCF of $338.5M in year one would have delivered a 12.5% vesting. However, the
Company did not achieve these performance milestones in year one so there was no accelerated vesting resulting from the fiscal year 2017 PSU grant.

Fiscal Year 2017 PSUs. Each NEO was granted a target number of fiscal year 2017 PSUs as set forth in the “Fiscal Year 2017 Long Term
Incentive Awards” table below. Between 0% and 200% of the target fiscal year 2017 PSUs will vest at the end of fiscal year 2019 based on our EPS and
FCF performance for fiscal year 2019. The threshold EPS goal delivers 50% vesting, and below threshold delivers 0% vesting. The target at which the
fiscal year 2017 PSUs will vest has been set by the Compensation Committee at $2.09, subject to adjustment to omit the effects of extraordinary items,
gain or loss on the disposal of a business segment, and unusual or infrequently occurring events or transactions.

Fiscal Year 2017 Long-Term Incentive Awards. The target award value actually received and the number of shares granted for each element of our
LTI compensation for fiscal year 2017 is set forth in the table below.

In addition to the regular cycle LTI awards noted above, in May 2016 the Executive team, including the NEOs with the exception of Mr. Prior,
received an additional Restricted Stock Unit grant. These RSU awards will vest 50% on the second anniversary of the grant date and 50% on the third
anniversary of the grant date. In evaluation of current ownership across the Section 16 officers, the Board felt that an inducement grant would accelerate
the competitive ownership stake in the Company as well as improve retention considering the limited values of unvested equity due to the Company’s
limited history of grants following the launch of the Company in November 2015.

In December 2016, the Committee and full Board awarded Mr. Prior a Restricted Stock Unit award valued at $2,250,000 at the time of grant as an
element of his employment agreement. The RSU award will vest 50% on the second anniversary of the grant date and 50% on the third anniversary of
the grant date. The purpose of this award was to provide Mr. Prior with a meaningful stake in our Company and to foster his long-term retention and
alignment of interests with those of our stockholders.

In accordance with our Equity Grant Policy, the target award values listed in the table above generally differ from the award values listed in the
Summary Compensation Table. In order to determine the number of Stock Options to award, the target grant value for options is divided by the fair
market value of an option determined by using the average closing price of our stock for the three-month period ending on the grant date and the Black
Scholes option pricing model. The number of shares underlying our Performance Share Units is also calculated by dividing the target grant value by the
average closing price of our stock for the three-month period ending on the grant date. This method is employed to reduce the impact of stock price
spikes, either positive or negative, when determining the number of shares underlying these awards. In contrast, the grant date fair values in the

Fiscal Year 2018 Long-Term Incentive Compensation

The Compensation Committee has approved several changes to the Long-Term Incentive Compensation program for fiscal year 2018 to enhance
the competitiveness of the plan and respond to areas of concern raised by external proxy advisors. In 2018, LTI awards were comprised of 60%
Performance Share Units and 40% Restricted Stock Units. The accelerated vesting provision associated with the fiscal 2017 PSU program was
eliminated, and the PSUs vest, based on performance, on the third anniversary of the grant date. One-third of the RSUs vest on each anniversary of the
grant date over three years.

In addition, the single trigger provision in the equity award agreements associated with a change in control scenario were eliminated for new
grants, beginning with annual grants made in May 2017.

We believe these changes will align executives’ interests with our stockholders’ interests, better align the CSRA equity plan with our peers,
reinforce retention and performance against our long-term goals, and encourage executive stock ownership.

Fiscal Year 2017 Target Total Direct Compensation

The chart below displays the value of each element of target Total Direct Compensation described above for our NEOs, presented based on fiscal
year-end annualized base salaries, targets and incentive percentages. The value of compensation actually realized will vary from the Compensation

Post-Employment Benefits

Retirement Plans. The Compensation Committee views retirement benefits as an important component of our executive compensation program.
As such, we offer our employees, including the NEOs, a retirement program that provides the opportunity to accumulate retirement income. We
periodically review our benefits program against our peer group and aim for the program to be competitive. None of our NEOs are eligible to participate
in our frozen defined-benefit pension plan.

Deferred Compensation Plan

  

We maintain the CSRA Deferred Compensation Plan, which is offered
to a select group of management employees. This unfunded plan allows
participants to defer receipt of incentive compensation and salary.
Additional details can be found under “Fiscal Year 2017 Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation” below.

Severance and Change in Control Compensation

In order to offer competitive total compensation packages to our executive officers, as well as to ensure the ongoing retention of these individuals,
we offer certain post-employment benefits to a select group of executive officers, including our NEOs. Mr. Prior’s severance is provided for in the CEO
Employment Agreement. In addition, the Executive Officer Employment Separation Policy (the “Separation Policy”) covers those executives reporting
directly to the CEO who are Section 16 officers. The CEO Employment Agreement and the Separation Policy provide “double trigger” income and
benefits continuity protection to the executive for the limited case in which the employment of the executive officer is terminated by the Company
without cause or by the executive for good reason during a specified window of time prior to (in the case of Mr. Prior) or following a change in control.
This is intended to preserve executive productivity and encourage retention during an actual or potential change in control of the Company.

The CEO Employment Agreement also provides severance benefits if Mr. Prior’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause or
Mr. Prior resigns for good reason in situations not involving a change in control. If Mr. Prior’s employment is terminated by the Company for cause, or
if he resigns without good reason, he would not be entitled to any benefits under the CEO Employment Agreement. Similarly, the Separation Policy
provides severance benefits, at the discretion of the CEO and Compensation Committee, to certain executives whose employment is terminated by the
Company, without cause, in situations not involving a change in control. An executive who resigns from the Company or is terminated for cause is not
entitled to benefits under the Separation Policy. We believe the importance of these benefits increases with the position and level of responsibility of the
executive.

Additional details regarding the CEO Employment Agreement and Separation Policy are provided under “Potential Payments Upon Change in
Control and Termination of Employment” below.

Perquisites and Other Benefits

Other Benefits. We provide benefits to eligible employees, including medical, dental, life, disability and accident insurance. These benefits are
available to all U.S. employees generally, including the NEOs. These programs are designed to provide certain basic quality of life benefits and
protections.

Perquisites. We provide certain limited perquisites to senior executives, including the NEOs, in order to enhance their security and productivity.
The Compensation Committee reviews the perquisites provided to the NEOs annually as part of its overall review of executive compensation. The
Compensation Committee has determined that it is reasonable and competitive to provide these benefits. These perquisites are described more fully in
the “Summary Compensation Table” below.

Compensation Framework

Role of Management

The CEO, with the assistance of the Chief Human Resources Officer, conducts an annual review of the Total Direct Compensation of each
executive officer, including the NEOs. The CEO’s review includes an assessment of each executive officer’s performance, the performance of the
individual’s respective business unit or function, executive retention considerations, succession potential, and the competitive market. Following such
review, the CEO recommends base salaries and target STI and LTI opportunities for the executive officers to the Compensation Committee.

Role of the Compensation Committee

The Compensation Committee, which is comprised entirely of independent directors, is responsible for overseeing the Company’s compensation
policies and programs. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Compensation Committee, working with Pearl Meyer, the independent compensation
consultant, annually reviews general trends in executive compensation, compensation design, and the total value and mix of compensation for our
executive officers. This process includes the review and approval of the target and actual Total Direct Compensation of each executive officer, taking
into consideration internal pay equity, tenure and performance of various executive officers, potential future contributions, succession potential, and
competitive market information. Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee may delegate any of its responsibilities to a subcommittee or to
Company employees or others. The Compensation Committee has not delegated its authority for compensation for executive officers. However, the
Compensation Committee has delegated authority under our equity incentive plans to the CEO to grant equity awards to employees who are not senior
executives, subject to certain limits.

CEO Compensation. The Compensation Committee works directly with its compensation consultant to provide a decision-making framework for
setting the CEO’s target Total Direct Compensation. The Compensation Committee establishes the goals relevant to the CEO’s compensation and makes
a recommendation to the Board for the CEO’s compensation. The independent directors of the Board review the Compensation Committee’s
recommendations and determine the CEO’s Total Direct Compensation.

Role of Compensation Consultant

To assist the Compensation Committee in discharging its responsibilities, the Compensation Committee has directly retained Pearl Meyer as its
independent compensation consultant.

Pearl Meyer consults with the Compensation Committee on executive compensation matters generally, including advising on trends and best
practices in the design, composition and policies of executive compensation programs and providing commentary and advice on management proposals
to the Compensation Committee. Specifically, during fiscal year 2017, Pearl Meyer advised the Compensation Committee on:
 

 •  Pay practice trends
 

 •  Proxy trends
 

 •  CEO compensation
 

 •  Non-employee director compensation
 

 •  Pay for performance
 

 •  Selection of peer group companies; and
 

 •  Peer group pay comparisons

Table of Contents

The compensation consultant also attends most Compensation Committee meetings at the request of the Committee Chair. Other than the work
performed in fiscal year 2017 for the Compensation Committee, Pearl Meyer did not provide any other services to CSRA or our executive officers.
Based on this and other factors reviewed by the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee has determined that the work performed by
Pearl Meyer as the compensation consultant to the Compensation Committee does not raise any conflict of interest. The Compensation Committee will
continue to monitor the independence of its compensation consultants on an annual basis.

Review of Market Compensation Data

The Compensation Committee reviews market pay levels and practices for NEOs using a combination of survey data and proxy disclosures on pay
for our peer group. In March 2016, the Compensation Committee reviewed and approved our peer group for the purposes of reviewing the
competitiveness of compensation opportunities for our NEOs.

The Compensation Committee considered several factors in its choice of peers, including the market in which the Company competes for
executive talent, industry classification, revenue size, business descriptions and other size characteristics such as EBITDA, market capitalization and
number of employees. The Peer Group includes the following 14 companies:

Peer Group

Company Name

L-3 Communications Holdings Inc.
Computer Sciences Corporation (now DXC Technology Co.)
NCR Corporation
Harris Corporation
NetApp, Inc.
Motorola Solutions, Inc.
Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation
Fiserv, Inc.
Rockwell Collins Inc.
Leidos Holdings, Inc.
Science Applications International Corporation
CACI International Inc.
Textron, Inc.
Unisys Corporation

Within this Peer Group, we consistently compete with 4 of the 14 peer companies, so the Compensation Committee applies a filter to the Peer
Group to ensure that competitor practices are not materially different from that of the Peer Group to protect against any significant market deviation.

Additional Compensation Policies

In addition to the components of our executive compensation program, we maintain the compensation policies described below.

Policy on Transactions in Company Securities and Related Derivatives

The Board of Directors has adopted a policy prohibiting directors, corporate officers and each employee of CSRA or its subsidiaries who are
deemed to be financial insiders, and members of their immediate families, from

entering into any transactions in our securities except during announced trading periods, or pursuant to an approved trading plan meeting the
requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. Such transactions are subject to a pre-approval requirement prior to entering any such transaction.
In addition, we prohibit directors, officers and financial insiders, and members of their immediate families, from engaging in derivative security
transactions with respect to our equity securities. We also discourage persons subject to this policy from margining or pledging our stock to secure a loan
or purchase shares of our stock on margin. None of the NEOs has margined or pledged any of our stock.

Equity Ownership Guidelines

The Compensation Committee has adopted equity ownership guidelines for senior level executives to encourage them to build their ownership
positions in our common stock over time and retain shares they earn through our equity incentive plans. The Compensation Committee believes that
stock ownership by our executive officers further aligns their interests with those of long-term stockholders. Under the equity ownership guidelines,
each senior level executive who has not yet achieved the equity ownership levels must retain a certain percentage of the net shares (after withholding for
taxes and exercise price) resulting from Stock Option exercises, Performance Share Unit payments, or other long-term incentives until the levels are
achieved. In order to encourage executives to meet the guidelines more quickly, there are higher retention requirements the further an executive is from
meeting the guidelines. Under this retention requirement, executives who have satisfied 50% or less of their ownership guideline must retain 100% of
their net shares, executives who have satisfied between 51% and 75% of their ownership guideline must retain 75% of their net shares, and executives
who have satisfied more than 75% of their ownership guidelines must retain 50% of their net shares. The ownership guidelines for our NEOs are as
follows:
 

Position   

Stock
Value as a
Percentage

of Base
Salary  

Chief Executive Officer    700% 
Other Named Executive Officers    300% 

The Compensation Committee reviews compliance with the guidelines on an annual basis and considers the amount of common stock held
directly or through the Company’s 401(k) plans and RSUs (but not Performance Share Units) in determining whether an executive has achieved his
designated equity ownership level.

Tax Deductibility of Compensation

Section 162(m) limits a company’s annual tax deduction for compensation to its CEO and its three other highest-paid executive officers employed
at year-end (other than the CFO) to $1 million per person, unless, among other things, the compensation is “performance-based,” as defined in
Section 162(m), and provided under a plan that has been approved by the stockholders. It is our policy to design and administer our compensation
program in a tax efficient manner and the Compensation Committee considers the impact of the deduction limitations imposed by Section 162(m) on the
Company. As noted above, compensation decisions are made, among other things, to ensure market competitiveness, to reward outstanding
performance, and to attract proven talent. Section 162(m) was amended effective for tax years commencing after December 31, 2017, which amendment
may adversely affect the deductibility of compensation paid to the named executive officers in future years.

Compensation Recoupment Policy

Under the Company’s equity grant agreements, employees may be required to forfeit awards or gains if a recipient breaches the non-competition,
non-solicitation of employees, or non-disclosure provisions of such agreements.

Summary Compensation Table

The following table provides information on the compensation of the Named Executive Officers (NEOs) in the fiscal years indicated. Since we
were not a reporting company prior to November 27, 2015, compensation for Messrs. Keffer and Haynes is presented for fiscal years 2016 and 2017
only. For Messrs. Reing and Nedzbala, compensation is presented for fiscal year 2017 only due to their initial inclusion as NEOs. For Mr. Prior, the table
presents compensation paid or awarded by CSC for fiscal year 2015 as well, since this information was previously required to be provided in response to
SEC filing requirements.

price at the time of grant.

Pursuant to SEC rules, we present the amounts excluding the impact of estimated forfeitures. For a discussion of the assumptions made in the
valuation of RSUs, reference is made to the section of Notes 1 and 17 to the Company’s Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements set

Fiscal Year 2017 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation

The Company sponsors two deferred compensation plans (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”) – one for the benefit of key executives and one for
the benefit of non-employee directors. Pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan, certain management and highly compensated employees are eligible
to defer all or a portion of their regular salaries and incentive compensation that exceeds the limitation set forth in Internal Revenue Section 401(a)(17)
and all or a portion of their incentive compensation, and non-employee directors are eligible to defer up to 100% of their compensation. No NEOs
participated in the deferred compensation plan during fiscal year 2017.

Potential Payments Upon Change in Control and Termination of Employment

We offer certain post-employment benefits to a select group of executive officers, including our NEOs. These post-employment benefits are
limited to the payments and benefits provided under the CEO Employment Agreement, which includes provisions that apply in both a change in control
situation and an involuntary termination or resignation for good reason situation absent a change in control, and the Separation Policy, which includes
provisions that apply in both a change in control situation and an involuntary termination situation prior to a change in control. The post-employment
benefits associated with this agreement and policy are detailed below.

For a description of potential payments and benefits that would be provided upon consummation of the Merger, see “Item 3 — Arrangements
between the Company and its Executive Officers, Directors and Affiliates” of the Schedule 14D-9.

Change in Control Termination Benefits

The table below reflects the value of compensation and benefits that would become payable to each of the NEOs under plans and arrangements
existing as of March 31, 2017 (the final day of fiscal year 2017), if a change in control had occurred on that date and, in circumstances explained below,
the executive’s employment had terminated. These amounts are reported based upon the executive’s compensation and service levels as of such date
and, if applicable, and in accordance with SEC regulations, based on the Company’s closing stock price of $29.29 on March 31, 2017, the last trading
day of fiscal year 2017. These benefits are in addition to benefits available prior to the occurrence of any termination of employment, including under
then-exercisable stock options, retirement plans, and deferred compensation plans, and benefits available generally to salaried employees, such as
distributions under the Company’s broad-based 401(k) plan.

The actual amounts that would be paid upon a NEO’s termination of employment in connection with a change in control can be determined only at
the time of any such event. Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon such an event, any actual
amounts paid or distributed may be higher or lower than reported below. Factors that could affect these amounts include the timing during the year of
any such event, the Company’s stock price and the executive’s age and service.

1. Cash severance for Mr. Prior equals (a) two and a half times the sum of (1) fiscal year 2017 annualized base salary and (2) target bonus, and

(b) annual bonus, based on actual performance, that would have been paid had he not been terminated, prorated based on the number of months
Mr. Prior was employed during the year of termination. For purposes of this disclosure, Mr. Prior’s actual fiscal year 2017 annual bonus is used as
the pro-rata bonus described above because the assumed termination date is prior to the date the bonus would have otherwise been paid.

2. Cash severance for NEOs other than Mr. Prior equals two times the sum of (1) fiscal year 2017 annualized base salary and (2) the prior three-year
average EICP payout (i.e., for fiscal years 2014-2016 performance and including, where applicable, EICP payments by CSC prior to the
Separation). For any partial year of employment, the bonus for the partial year is annualized to determine the average EICP payout.

3. The intrinsic value of RSUs and PSUs, per share, is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on March 31, 2017 ($29.29), the final
trading day of fiscal year 2017. The intrinsic value of a stock option, per share, is equal to the excess of (a) the closing market price of our
common stock on March 31, 2017, over (b) the option’s exercise price per share. All outstanding PSUs were assumed to vest at target upon a
change in control. All outstanding service-vesting RSUs and unvested stock options were assumed to vest upon a change in control.

4. Total payments do not reflect any potential reduction to avoid an excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended.

Mr. Prior entered into the CEO Employment Agreement with the Company on December 20, 2016. If Mr. Prior’s employment with the Company
is terminated without “cause” (other than due to this death or disability) or due to his resignation for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the
employment agreement), in each case within two years following a change in control transaction, Mr. Prior would receive, in addition to accrued
benefits, the following:
 

 
•  one-time payment equal to two and one half times the sum of (i) Mr. Prior’s then-current annual base salary plus (ii) his target annual bonus

for the year of termination;
 

 
•  cash lump-sum payment equal to the annual bonus, based on actual performance, that would have been paid had he not been terminated,

prorated based on the number of months Mr. Prior was employed during the year of termination (rounded up to the nearest whole month),
which amount is payable at such time as the bonus is otherwise paid to similarly situated executives; and

 

 •  continued coverage for 30 months in the Company’s medical, dental and health plans at the Company’s expense.

If, prior to a change in control but at the request or suggestion of the buyer in contemplation of a change in control transaction, Mr. Prior’s
employment with the Company is terminated without cause (other than due to

Table of Contents

this death or disability) or due to his resignation for good reason, then within ten days after the change in control, Mr. Prior is entitled to, in addition to
continuation of the severance payable pursuant to his employment agreement (which, absent a change in control, is equal to 24 months of base salary
continuation, a pro-rated bonus for the year of termination of employment and continued coverage for 24 months in the Company’s medical, dental and
health plans, at active employee rates) a special payment equal to the excess of (i) the product of two and one-half times the sum of his base salary and
target annual bonus over (ii) two times his base salary.

Mr. Prior’s termination of employment with the Company is deemed for “good reason” if it occurs as a result of any of the following without
Mr. Prior’s express written consent: (i) a material decrease in Mr. Prior’s base salary (other than as part of an across the board reduction equally
applicable on a percentage basis to all executive officers of the Company); (ii) a relocation of Mr. Prior’s principal office by more than 50 miles, unless
the Company agrees to reimburse Mr. Prior for reasonable moving expenses and other customary relocation benefits incurred by him and his family with
respect to their relocation from their primary residence in connection with such a relocation, subject to customary documentation requirements; or (iii) a
material diminution in Mr. Prior’s position, duties, responsibilities or reporting lines. “Good reason” will not occur unless Mr. Prior provides a detailed
written notice to the Company of any fact or circumstance believed to constitute good reason within 30 days following the occurrence of such fact or
circumstance, the Company is given at least 30 days to cure such fact or circumstance, and Mr. Prior’s employment with the Company terminates
immediately following such 30 day cure period in the event the Company fails to cure such fact or circumstance.

In addition, to the extent that any payment to be made to Mr. Prior (a) constitutes a “parachute payment” under Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and (b) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then such payment
will either be made (i) in full or (ii) in such lesser amount that would result in no portion of such payment being subject to the Section 4999 excise tax,
whichever of the foregoing amounts (taking into account all applicable taxes), results in Mr. Prior’s receipt on an after-tax basis of the greatest amount
of Total Direct Compensation, notwithstanding that all or some portion of the awards may be taxable under Section 4999.

Payment of the amounts contemplated above are conditioned upon Mr. Prior’s execution (and non-revocation) of a release of claims against the
Company and its affiliates in substantially the form attached to his employment agreement and compliance with applicable restrictive covenants.

Each of the NEOs other than Mr. Prior is covered by the Change in Control provisions associated with the Separation Policy, which provides
certain benefits to participants in the event of a Change in Control (as defined below) of the Company. If there were a Change in Control and any of
them either:
 

 •  had a voluntary termination of employment for “good reason” (as defined below) within two years afterward, or
 

 •  had an involuntary termination of employment, other than for death, disability or cause (as defined below), within three years afterward,

then the executive would receive a one-time payment and certain health and welfare benefits during a specified period after termination. The amount of
the one-time payment is equal to two times the sum of the participant’s then-current annual base salary plus the average of the three most recent annual
EICP awards paid (with an annualized bonus used for any partial year of service). The number of years after termination of employment during which a
participant would receive health and welfare benefits is equal to one year if the qualifying termination of employment occurs prior to a Change in
Control or two years if the qualifying termination of employment occurs following a Change in Control.

There is a potential six-month delay in payments and benefits provided under the Separation Policy to certain specified employees (as determined
under Section 409A). The Separation Policy provides for the crediting of earnings during any such payment or benefits delay period.

Table of Contents

For purposes of the Separation Policy, the following definitions apply:
 

 
•  “Change of Control” means the consummation of a “change in the ownership” of the Company, a “change in effective control” of the

Company or a “change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets” of the Company, in each case, as defined under Section 409A
of the Code.

 

 
•  A participant’s termination of employment with the Company is deemed for “Good Reason” if it occurs within six months of any of the

following without the participant’s express written consent:
 

 
1. A substantial change in the nature, or diminution in the status, of the participant’s duties or position from those in effect immediately

prior to the Change of Control;
 

 

2. A reduction by the Company in the participant’s annual base salary as in effect on the date of a Change of Control or as in effect
thereafter if such compensation has been increased and such increase was approved prior to the Change of Control; a failure to
continue in effect any stock option or other equity-based or non-equity based incentive compensation plan in effect immediately
prior to the Change of Control, or a reduction in the participant’s participation in any such plan, unless the participant is afforded the
opportunity to participate in an alternative incentive compensation plan of reasonably equivalent value;

 

 
3. A failure to provide the participant the same number of paid vacation days per year available to him or her prior to the Change of

Control, or any material reduction or the elimination of any material benefit or perquisite enjoyed by the participant immediately
prior to the Change of Control;

 

 
4. Any material breach by the Company of any provision of the Separation Policy or of any agreement entered into pursuant to the

Separation Policy or any stock option or restricted stock agreement;
 

 
5. Conduct by the Company, against the participant’s volition, that would cause the participant to commit fraudulent acts or would

expose the participant to criminal liability; or
 

 
6. Any failure by the Company to obtain the assumption of the Separation Policy or any agreement entered into pursuant to the

Separation Policy by any successor or assign of the Company;
 

 •  “Cause” means:
 

 1. fraud, misappropriation, embezzlement or other act of material misconduct against the Company or any of its affiliates;
 

 2. conviction of a felony involving a crime of moral turpitude;
 

 
3. willful and knowing violation of any rules or regulations of any governmental or regulatory body material to the business of the

Company; or
 

 

4. substantial and willful failure to render services in accordance with the terms of the Separation Policy (other than as a result of
illness, accident or other physical or mental incapacity), provided that (a) a demand for performance of services has been delivered
to the participant in writing by or on behalf of our Board of Directors at least 60 days prior to termination identifying the manner in
which the Board believes that the participant has failed to perform, and (b) the participant has thereafter failed to remedy such failure
to perform.

Vesting of Equity Awards Upon Change in Control. Stock Options and RSUs, including Performance Share Units, provide for accelerated vesting
upon a Change in Control, defined as a change in ownership of the Company, a change in effective control of the Company or a change in the ownership
of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, in each case as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. PSUs vest at target upon a
Change in Control occurring on or before the end of the final fiscal year in the performance period.

Termination Benefits Unrelated to Change in Control

The table below reflects the value of compensation and benefits that would become payable to each of the NEOs under plans and arrangements
existing as of March 31, 2017, if their employment had been terminated on that date in the circumstances explained below. These amounts are reported
based upon each such executive’s compensation and service levels as of such date and, if applicable, in accordance with SEC regulations, based on the
Company’s closing stock price of $29.29 on March 31, 2017, the final trading day during fiscal year 2017. These benefits are in addition to benefits
available prior to the occurrence of any termination of employment, including under then-exercisable Stock Options, retirement plans and deferred
compensation plans, and benefits available generally to salaried employees, such as distributions under the Company’s broad-based 401(k) plan.

The actual amounts that would be paid upon an NEO’s termination of employment absent a change in control can be determined only at the time
of any such event. Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon such an event, any actual amounts paid
or distributed may be higher or lower than reported below. Factors that could affect these amounts include the timing during the year of any such event,
the Company’s stock price and the executive’s age and service.

Additional information regarding the conditions under which these benefits are payable and the definitions used under the arrangements for
determining whether an event triggering the benefit has occurred are discussed further following the table.

1. Mr. Prior is entitled to 24 months of base salary continuation plus a pro-rata incentive bonus based on actual performance for the year of

employment termination. For purposes of this disclosure, Mr. Prior’s actual fiscal year 2017 annual bonus is used as the pro-rata bonus described
above.

2. NEO’s other than Mr. Prior are entitled to twelve months of base salary continuation plus a pro-rata target incentive bonus (EICP) for the year of
employment termination. For purposes of this disclosure, target fiscal year 2017 EICP is used as the pro-rata bonus described above.

3. The NEOs are entitled to twelve months (24 months for Mr. Prior) of Company-subsidized healthcare continuation coverage.
4. The RSUs granted to Mr. Prior pursuant to his employment agreement will fully vest upon a termination by the Company without cause, due to his

death or disability, or upon Mr. Prior’s resignation for good reason.

The CEO Employment Agreement provides severance benefits to Mr. Prior in situations not involving a change in control. Upon a termination of
Mr. Prior’s employment by the Company without cause (as described above) or upon Mr. Prior’s resignation for good reason (as described above), he
will receive 24 months of base salary continuation paid in installments and up to 24 months of Company-provided healthcare coverage continuation.
Mr. Prior is also eligible to receive a pro-rata portion of his of his annual bonus for the year of termination had his employment not been terminated,
paid based on actual achievement. In addition, if Mr. Prior’s employment is terminated due to his death or permanent disability (as defined in the CEO
Employment Agreement), Mr. Prior or his estate is entitled to receive his earned but unpaid base salary through the termination, unreimbursed business
expenses, any earned and unused vacation, benefits or amounts to which Mr. Prior or his dependents may be entitled under the employee benefit or
equity plans, grants or programs of the

Company and any unpaid annual bonus for a completed fiscal year paid when bonuses for the applicable year are paid to other executives. In addition,
the RSUs granted to Mr. Prior in connection with his employment agreement fully vest upon a termination of employment by the Company without
cause, resignation for good reason or due to death or disability.

The Separation Policy also provides severance benefits to certain executives whose employment with the Company is terminated in situations not
involving a change in control. The Separation Policy covers those executive officers reporting directly to the CEO who are subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act.

Upon termination of employment by the Company without cause (as defined above), each executive covered by the Separation Policy may
receive, in the discretion of the Company and the Compensation Committee, up to twelve months of base salary continuation, paid in installments, and
up to twelve months of Company-provided healthcare coverage continuation. Terminated executives also are eligible to receive a pro-rata portion of the
EICP award earned, paid at target, for the year of employment termination, subject to approval by the Compensation Committee. Except as provided
below, the Company does not provide accelerated vesting for RSUs that are not vested upon a termination of employment by the Company without
cause (as defined above).

Vesting of Equity Awards Upon Terminations of Employment. All annual equity awards provide for accelerated vesting (unless the Compensation
Committee determines otherwise) upon retirement, other than for Cause (as defined below), at age 62 or older with at least ten years of service (and, in
the case of performance share units, provided the executive’s retirement date is more than one year after the grant date). None of the NEOs was eligible
to retire under this definition as of March 31, 2017, the last day of fiscal year 2017. In addition, all annual equity awards, along with service-based
inducement awards, provide for accelerated vesting upon an executive’s termination of employment due to death or permanent disability, with vesting of
annual-cycle Performance Share Units occurring with respect to only a pro-rata fraction of the target amount (based on the executive’s service during the
applicable performance period) as opposed to the full target amount. If the NEOs had terminated employment due to death or permanent disability on
March 31, 2017, they would have each received the amounts shown next to their names for early vesting of stock options, service-vesting RSUs and
PSUs on the Change in Control Termination Benefits table above, except that amounts for annual-cycle PSU grants would be pro-rated. The pro-rated
PSU amounts for Messrs. Prior, Keffer, Haynes, Reing and Nedzbala would have been $1,617,511; $324,826; $377,861; $184,732; and $129,862,
respectively.

Stock options converted from CSC options that were originally granted prior to May 2013 that are vested but unexercised at the time of
employment termination remain exercisable until the earlier of (1) the option expiration date or (2) the fifth anniversary of employment termination (for
terminations due to death or permanent disability and all terminations at age 62 or older other than for Cause), or three months after employment

 believes that the employee has failed to perform, and (2) the employee has thereafter failed to remedy such failure to perform.

There are provisions in the award agreements for all Stock Options and RSUs (including Performance Share Units) which require the holder of
such securities to deliver to the Company an amount in cash equal to the intrinsic value of the securities on the date (the “Realization Date”) they had
vested (in the case of RSUs or restricted stock) or were exercised (in the case of stock options) if the holder:
 

 •  competes with the Company after voluntary termination of employment and prior to six months after the Realization Date, or
 

 
•  solicits the Company’s customers or solicits for hire or hires the Company’s employees, or discloses the Company’s confidential

information, after voluntary or involuntary termination of employment and prior to one year after a Realization Date.

These forfeiture provisions do not apply if there has been a Change in Control within three years prior to the employment termination date.

The Company has included non-compete/non-solicitation language in all equity agreements covering all participants in our long term incentive
plans. Pursuant to these terms, in the event an executive competes with CSRA during the twelve months following any termination of employment,
solicits our employees or clients during the 24 months (twelve months for Mr. Prior) following any termination of employment, or violates
non-disclosure provisions, the award would be forfeited and the Company could clawback amounts previously paid or received in respect thereof.
Moreover, as a condition to receiving severance under the Separation Policy, the Company requires that executives agree to certain restrictive covenants,
which generally include a 24-month post-termination non-solicitation of employees and customers and a twelve-month non-compete.
