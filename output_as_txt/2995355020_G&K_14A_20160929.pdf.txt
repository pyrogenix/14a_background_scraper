Dear Shareholder:

You are cordially invited to attend the annual meeting of the shareholders of G&K Services, Inc., a Minnesota corporation
(“G&K,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”), which will be held at 5995 Opus Parkway, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343, on
November 15, 2016, at 10:00 a.m., local time (such meeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the “annual
meeting”).

As the Company previously announced, the Company, Cintas Corporation, a Washington corporation (“Cintas”), and Bravo
Merger Sub, Inc., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Cintas (“Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated as of August 15, 2016 (such agreement, as it may be amended from time to time, is referred to as the “merger
agreement”), pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist and the Company will survive as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Cintas. If the Merger is completed, at the effective time, each share of Class A common stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than dissenting shares and shares owned by the Company, Cintas or any of
their respective subsidiaries) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $97.50 per share in cash, without interest, and
subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

The Company’s Board of Directors (the “Company Board” or “our board”) (i) unanimously (of those present) approved the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger and (ii) unanimously recommends that the
Company’s shareholders approve the merger agreement, including the Merger.

The annual meeting will be held for the following purposes:

1. to approve the merger agreement;

2. to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s
named executive officers in connection with the Merger, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of the enclosed
proxy statement entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger”;

3. to approve the adjournment of the annual meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the annual meeting to approve the proposal to approve the merger agreement or in the absence of
a quorum;

4. to elect the three Class III directors named in the attached proxy statement to serve for terms of three years;

5. to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, as our independent auditors for fiscal
year 2017; and

6. to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers.

At the annual meeting we will also transact any other business that may properly come before the annual meeting and any
adjournment or postponement thereof.

The Company Board recommends that the shareholders of the Company vote “FOR” each of the proposals listed above and
described in more detail in the accompanying proxy statement.

The enclosed proxy statement provides specific information concerning the annual meeting and the parties involved, including a
description of the merger agreement, the Merger and the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive
officers of the Company in connection with the Merger. A copy of the merger agreement is also attached as Annex A to the proxy
statement. We urge you to read the entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated by reference
in the proxy statement, as it sets forth the details of the proposals to be voted upon at the annual meeting, including the merger
agreement and other important information related to the Merger. In addition, you may obtain information about us from documents
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. See “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”

Your vote is very important. The Merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
common stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting vote in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement. A failure
to vote your shares of common stock on the proposal to approve the merger agreement will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement.

If you have any questions or need assistance in voting your shares, please contact our proxy solicitor, D.F. King & Co., Inc., at
(888) 605-1956 (toll free) or (212) 269-5550 (call collect).

Thank you for your continued support.

Sincerely,
 

Douglas A. Milroy
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved
the Merger, passed upon the merits or fairness of the Merger, the merger agreement or the other transactions contemplated
thereby or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure in this document. Any representation to the contrary is a
criminal offense.

and return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope or submit your proxy by either telephone or on the Internet
by following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card, thereby ensuring that your shares of common stock will be represented at the
annual meeting if you are unable to attend. In-person attendance at the annual meeting does not by itself constitute a vote.

Shareholders who do not vote in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement will have the right to assert dissenters’
rights if they deliver a demand for dissenters’ rights before the vote is taken on the merger agreement and comply with all the
requirements of Minnesota law, which is summarized herein and reproduced in its entirety in Annex C to the accompanying proxy
statement. See the section entitled “Dissenters’ Rights.”

Table of Contents

from time to time, is referred to in this proxy statement as the “merger agreement.” A copy of the merger agreement is attached as
Annex A. The merger agreement provides, among other things, that at the effective time of the Merger (the “effective time”),
Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the Merger (the “surviving
corporation”) as a wholly owned subsidiary of Cintas. Upon completion of the Merger, the Company will thereby become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Cintas, G&K common stock will no longer be publicly traded and the Company’s existing shareholders will
cease to have any ownership interest in the Company. Instead, at the effective time, each share of Class A common stock, par value
$0.50 per share, of the Company (referred to in this proxy statement as “common stock,” “G&K common stock” or “Company
common stock”), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares for which the holders thereof
have properly perfected dissenters’ rights with respect to such shares under Minnesota law (such shares, “dissenting shares”) and
shares held by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, Cintas, Merger Sub or any other
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Cintas (the “cancelled shares” and, together with the dissenting shares, the “excluded
shares”)) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.

The Merger Consideration (page 28)

The merger consideration will be $97.50 per share in cash, without interest, and subject to any applicable withholding taxes
(referred to in this proxy statement as the “merger consideration”).

Treatment of Stock Plans (page 59)

Company Options. Except as provided below, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement:
(i) the vesting of each company option that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time shall be accelerated in
full immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) each company option that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the
effective time shall be cancelled and terminated as of the effective time, and (iii) each holder of each such company option shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product of
(x) the total number of shares previously subject to such company option and (y) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration
over the exercise price per share of such company option, less any required withholding taxes. Each company option that is granted
after December 31, 2016 to a person other than Douglas A. Milroy or any employee covered by the company’s Executive
Severance and Change in Control Policy that provides for pro-rata vesting upon the effective time will vest pro-rata in accordance
with its terms (and not in accordance with clause (i) above), will result in the unvested portion being forfeited upon the effective
time, and will result in the payment described in clause (iii) above being made only with respect to the vested portion of such
company option. Any company option with an exercise price equal to, or in excess of, the per share merger consideration will be
cancelled at the effective time for no consideration. For further description of the treatment of Company options under the merger
agreement, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Company Equity Awards; Stock Purchase Program
— Company Options.”

Restricted Stock. Except as provided below, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement,
each award of restricted stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and not or no longer subject to
performance based vesting conditions will become vested and no longer subject to restrictions immediately prior to the effective

become vested as of immediately prior to the effective time, with respect to the number of shares of restricted stock determined as
if the applicable performance goals had been achieved at the target level of performance at the end of the applicable performance
period. Such vested and unrestricted shares shall be treated in the same manner as company shares generally in the merger, except
that the merger consideration paid to the holder shall be reduced by any required withholding taxes. Each award of restricted stock
that is granted after December 31, 2016 to a person other than Douglas A.

Milroy or any employee covered by the company’s Executive Severance and Change in Control Policy that provides for pro-rata
vesting upon the effective time will vest pro-rata in accordance with its terms (instead of vesting as provided above) and will result
in the unvested portion being forfeited as of the effective time for no consideration. Promptly following the effective time, any cash
dividends previously paid by the Company with respect to restricted stock and held as of the effective time by the Company or its
designated agent shall be distributed by the Company to the holder of such restricted stock, to the extent such restricted stock has
become vested as described above. For further description of the treatment of Company restricted stock under the merger
agreement, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Company Equity Awards; Stock Purchase Program
— Restricted Stock.”

Other Awards. Except as provided below, each award of a right under any stock plan (other than awards of company options
or restricted stock, the treatment of which is specified above) entitling the holder thereof to shares or cash equal to or based on the
value of shares (a “share unit”) that is outstanding or payable as of the effective time shall be cancelled and terminated as of the
effective time and each share unit holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to be paid an amount
in cash (without interest) equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares underlying such share units (or, if subject to
performance-based vesting, the number of shares at the target level of performance) and (ii) the per share merger consideration,
less any required withholding taxes. Each share unit that is granted after December 31, 2016 to a person other than Douglas A.
Milroy or any employee covered by the company’s Executive Severance and Change in Control Policy that provides for pro-rata
vesting upon the effective time will be treated as described in the foregoing except that the cash payment amount to be paid to each
such holder will be calculated based on the number of shares underlying the pro-rata vested share units (instead of the total number
of shares as provided in clause (i) above) and will result in the unvested portion of the share units being forfeited for no
consideration. For further description of the treatment of other awards under the merger agreement, see the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement — Treatment of Company Equity Awards; Stock Purchase Program — Other Awards.”

additional conditions:
 

 

•  the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Cintas and Merger Sub as of August 15, 2016 and as of and as

When the Merger Becomes Effective (page 57)

The completion of the Merger is subject to the adoption of the merger agreement by the requisite company vote of the
Company’s shareholders and the satisfaction of the other closing conditions.

As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to consummate the Merger not later than the second quarter of calendar year
2017. The Merger is subject to various regulatory clearances and approvals and other conditions, and it is possible that factors
outside the control of G&K or Cintas could result in the Merger being completed at a later time, or not at all. There may be a
substantial amount of time between the annual meeting and the consummation of the Merger.

Recommendation of the Company Board (page 35)

After careful consideration, the Company Board approved the merger agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. The Company Board recommends that G&K shareholders vote “FOR” the proposal
to approve the merger agreement at the annual meeting.

Reasons for the Merger (page 35)

For a description of the reasons considered by the Company Board in deciding to recommend adoption of the merger
agreement, see the sections entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Reasons for Recommending the Approval of the Merger
Agreement.”

Opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch (page 40)

In connection with the Merger, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (“BofA Merrill Lynch”), G&K’s financial
advisor, delivered to the Company Board a written opinion, dated August 15, 2016, as to the fairness, from a financial point of
view and as of the date of the opinion, of the merger consideration to be received by holders of G&K common stock. The full text
of the written opinion, dated August 15, 2016, of BofA Merrill Lynch, which describes, among other things, the assumptions made,
procedures followed, factors

considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B to this document and is incorporated by reference
herein in its entirety. BofA Merrill Lynch provided its opinion to the Company Board (in its capacity as such) for the benefit
and use of the Company Board in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the merger consideration from a
financial point of view. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger and no opinion or
view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be
available to G&K or in which G&K might engage or as to the underlying business decision of G&K to proceed with or
effect the Merger. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address any other aspect of the Merger and does not constitute a
recommendation to any shareholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the proposed Merger or any related matter.

Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 46)

In considering the recommendation of the Company Board with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that
some of the Company’s directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the
interests of the Company’s shareholders generally. Interests of officers and directors that may be different from, or in addition to,
the interests of the Company’s shareholders include, among others, treatment of the outstanding Company equity awards pursuant
to the merger agreement, potential severance and retention benefits and other payments and rights to ongoing indemnification and
insurance coverage. The Company Board was aware of these different or additional interests and considered such interests along
with other matters in approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. These
interests are discussed in more detail in the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) —Interests of the Company’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Financing (page 54)

In connection with execution of the merger agreement, Cintas expects to fund the merger consideration in part with new debt
incurred under a debt financing commitment letter previously provided to the Company. In this respect, Cintas received debt
financing commitments in the amount of $2.3 billion. Cintas has agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain the debt financing
contemplated by such debt financing commitment letter. There is, however, no financing condition to Cintas’ obligation to
consummate the Merger.

Litigation Relating to the Merger (page 53)

On September 26, 2016, a putative shareholder class action lawsuit, captioned Klein v. G&K Services, Incorporated, et al.,
Civil Action No. 16-cv-03198 (RHK) (KMM), was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, against
the Company and the members of the Company Board. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and alleges, among other things, that the Company’s preliminary proxy statement contains false
and misleading statements and/or omits material information. The complaint seeks, among other things, injunctive relief and an
award of attorneys’ fees and expenses. The parties believe the claims asserted in the lawsuit are without merit.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 53)

If you are a U.S. holder (as defined under “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger”), the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local or foreign
income or other tax laws. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the
exchange of shares of common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the
application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws).

Regulatory Approvals (page 55)

HSR Clearance and Competition Act (Canada) Approval. Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including
the Merger, may not be completed until notifications have been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”), the United States Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and all
statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. Under the Competition Act (Canada), notification concerning the
transaction must be filed with the Competition Commissioner. Similarly, under the Competition Act (Canada), transactions above
certain financial thresholds, including the Merger, may not be completed until notice has been given to, and prescribed information
filed with, the Competition Commissioner and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied.

Completion of the Merger is subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, and
either (i) the receipt of an advance ruling certificate from the Competition Commissioner (which has not been rescinded prior to the
completion of the Merger) or (ii) the receipt of a no action letter in respect of the Merger from the Competition Commissioner
along with the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Competition Act (Canada) (“Competition Act
Approval”). On August 29, 2016, Cintas filed its Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC. On
August 30, 2016, the Company filed its Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC. On September 12,
2016, both the Company and Cintas filed their respective pre-merger notification forms with the Competition Commissioner, and
Cintas also filed a request for an advance ruling certificate or no-action letter.

On September 29, 2016, each of the Company and Cintas received a request for additional information and documentary
material, commonly referred to as a “second request,” from the FTC, pursuant to the HSR Act, in connection with the Merger. A
“second request” is a routine part of the FTC’s review of proposed transactions. The FTC’s “second request” has the effect of
extending the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger until the 30th day after substantial compliance by the
Company and Cintas with the “second request,” unless the waiting period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated
sooner by the FTC.

Commitments to Obtain Approvals. If necessary to satisfy the applicable closing condition related to requisite antitrust
clearances, the Company and Cintas have agreed, among other things, (i) to propose, negotiate, commit to, effect and agree to, by
consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, holding separate, and other disposition of the
businesses, assets, properties, products, product lines, and equity interests of Cintas, the Company, and their respective subsidiaries
and take such action or actions that would in the aggregate have a similar effect, (ii) create, terminate, or divest relationships,
ventures, contractual rights or obligations of Cintas, the Company or their respective subsidiaries, and (iii) otherwise take or
commit to take any action that would limit Cintas’ freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or
indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity interests, products, product lines or properties of the Cintas or the Company (including any
of their respective subsidiaries). However, the Company and Cintas will not be required to take, or cause to be taken, or commit to
take, or commit to cause to be taken, any divestiture, license, hold separate, sale or other disposition (1) of, or with respect to, any
of the products, product lines, services or service lines, in each case in whole or in part, of the Company, Cintas or any of their
respective subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, in excess of $300 million of net sales (but excluding any related assets,
businesses, properties, or equity interests, which will not be included in the calculation of net sales) or (2) of, or with respect to,
Cintas’ “CINTAS” trademark or trade name. See the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement — Efforts to Consummate the
Merger” and “— Divestitures and Triggering Divestiture.”

For purposes of the regulatory approvals provisions in the merger agreement, the calculation of “net sales” means net sales
with respect to any product, product line, service or service line, in each case, in whole or in part, measured by reference to the net
sales associated with such product, product line, service or service line for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2016, in the case of
products, product lines, services or service lines of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or May 31, 2016, in the case of Cintas
or any of its subsidiaries. However, any related assets, businesses, properties, or equity interests shall not be included in the
calculation of net sales.

Dissenter’s Rights (page 123)

If the Merger is approved and becomes effective, shareholders who do not vote their shares in favor of the Merger will be
entitled to statutory dissenters’ rights if they strictly comply with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the Minnesota Business
Corporation Act, as amended, (the “MBCA”). For a description of the rights of such holders and of the procedures to be followed
in order to assert such rights and obtain payment of the fair value of their shares of stock, see Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of
the MBCA, copies of which are attached as Annex C of this proxy statement, as well as the information set forth below.

IN ORDER TO PERFECT DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE MERGER, A SHAREHOLDER MUST
SEND A NOTICE TO THE COMPANY BEFORE THE DATE OF THE ANNUAL MEETING AND MUST NOT VOTE IN
FAVOR OF THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE MERGER BY PROXY OR OTHERWISE.

Delisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock (page 56)

If the Merger is completed, the Company common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and
deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation (page 65)

Pursuant to the merger agreement, none of the Company, its subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its
subsidiaries may, and the Company will direct its and its subsidiaries’ employees, investment bankers, lenders, attorneys,
accountants, agents and other advisors and representatives (collectively, “representatives”) not to, directly or indirectly:
 

 
•  initiate, solicit, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that

constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any “acquisition proposal,” as described in the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement — Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation”;

 

 
•  engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public

information to any third party relating to, any acquisition proposal, except to notify such third party of the existence of
the non-solicitation restrictions of the merger agreement;

 

 
•  enter into any letter of intent or similar document, or any agreement or commitment, providing for any acquisition

proposal; or
 

 

•  grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or confidentiality agreement in connection with an
acquisition proposal; provided, however, that if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that it would be inconsistent with the Company’s directors’ fiduciary obligations under applicable
Law not to do so, the Company may waive any standstill or similar provisions in any agreement to which it is a party to
the extent necessary to permit a person to make, on a confidential basis to Company Board, an acquisition proposal.

However, if, before the requisite company vote is obtained, the Company receives a written acquisition proposal from any
third party (that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation restrictions of the merger agreement), which (i) the Company
Board determines in good faith to be bona fide and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel that failure to take such action, in light of the acquisition proposal and the terms of the merger agreement, would be
inconsistent with the Company’s directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, the Company may:
 

 
•  if the Company Board has determined in good faith based on the information then available and after consultation with

the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors that such acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior
proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a superior proposal:

 

 
•  provide information to the person who made such acquisition proposal, but only if the Company receives from the

person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on

terms not less restrictive to such other party than those contained in the confidentiality agreement (excluding any
standstill provision) with Cintas and, to the extent such information has not been previously made available to
Cintas, promptly makes available to Cintas any information the Company discloses to such person or its
representatives; and

 

 •  engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such person and its representatives; and
 

 

•  if the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and
financial advisors that such acquisition proposal is a superior proposal, so long as the Company has complied with
certain obligations set forth in the merger agreement, which are described below in the section below entitled
“— Change in Board Recommendation,” approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve,
recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) such acquisition proposal.

Change in Board Recommendation (page 67)

The Company Board has recommended that G&K shareholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger agreement.
The merger agreement permits the Company Board to make a “change of recommendation” (as described in the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement — Change in Board Recommendation”) only in certain limited circumstances, as described below.

At any time after August 15, 2016 and prior to the time the requisite company vote is obtained, the Company Board may
make a “change of recommendation” in response to an “intervening event” if prior to taking such action, (i) the Company Board
has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, (ii) G&K has delivered to Cintas a written notice stating that the Company Board
intends to take such action no less than four business days prior to making such change of recommendation and has provided
Cintas a description of the intervening event, and (iii) at the end of such notice period, the Company Board must have considered
in good faith any revisions to the terms of the merger agreement proposed in writing by Cintas, if any, and have determined, after
consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to make a change of recommendation
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Change in
Board Recommendation.”

Further, at any time after August 15, 2016 and prior to the time the requisite company vote is obtained, if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that an acquisition
proposal made after August 15, 2016 (that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation restrictions of the merger agreement
(other than an immaterial breach)) is a “superior proposal,” and failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
Company’s directors’ fiduciary duties, then the Company Board may (1) make a change of recommendation and/or (2) cause G&K
to terminate the merger agreement and pay a $60 million termination fee to Cintas on or before the termination date. Prior to
making any such change of recommendation or terminating the merger agreement and paying the termination fee with respect to a
superior proposal, (1) G&K must have given Cintas at least four business days’ prior written notice of its intention to terminate the
merger agreement and pay the termination fee, and have provided Cintas the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of
the party making, any such superior proposal and copies of the most current version of the agreement reflecting such terms and
conditions and (2) after providing such notice and prior to taking any such action with respect to a superior proposal, G&K must
have negotiated in good faith with Cintas during such four business day period (to the extent that Cintas indicates to the Company
that Cintas desires to negotiate) with respect to, and must have considered in good faith, any changes to the merger agreement
agreed to be made in writing by Cintas so that such superior proposal ceases to constitute a superior proposal. See the sections
entitled “The Merger Agreement —Change in Board Recommendation” and “— Termination Fee.”

the Company Board set forth in the merger agreement (other than an immaterial breach) and G&K pays to Cintas
the termination fee prior to or concurrently with its termination of the merger agreement; or

 

 

•  at any time if G&K is not then in material breach of the merger agreement and there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Cintas or Merger Sub in the merger agreement, or any
such representation or warranty will have become untrue after the date of the merger agreement, in each case such
that the relevant conditions under the merger agreement would not be satisfied by Cintas and such breach or
condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within the earlier of (i) 30 calendar days after written notice
thereof is given by G&K to Cintas and (ii) the date that is three business days prior to the end date; or

 

 •  by Cintas:
 

 

•  if the Company Board (i) has made a change of recommendation; (ii) following the public announcement of an
acquisition proposal, has failed to reaffirm its approval and recommendation of the merger agreement and the
Merger within ten business days after receipt of a written request to do so from Cintas in accordance with the
provisions of the merger agreement; or (iii) prior to the earlier of (A) the day prior to the date of the shareholders
meeting and (B) eleven business days after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer for outstanding
shares that has been publicly disclosed (other than by Cintas or an affiliate of Cintas), fails to recommend against
such tender offer or exchange offer;

 

 
•  if G&K or any of its representatives breaches any covenant relating to non-solicitation, the consideration of other

acquisition proposals, and a change of recommendation of the Company Board set forth in the merger agreement
in any material respect; or

covenants relating to (i) non-solicitation, (ii) the consideration of other acquisition proposals, or (iii) a change of
recommendation of the Company Board set forth in the merger agreement (other than an immaterial breach) and G&K
pays to Cintas such termination fee prior to or concurrently with its termination of the merger agreement;

nor Merger Sub is then in material breach of the merger agreement, by Cintas because there has been a breach of any

respect to such acquisition proposal within twelve months after the termination of the merger agreement. See the section
entitled “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fee.”

Reverse Termination Fee (page 75)

Cintas will pay G&K a reverse termination fee in an amount equal to $100 million in immediately available funds if the
merger agreement is terminated by either Cintas or G&K in the following circumstances:
 

 
•  if any court or government order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the

Merger shall have become final and non-appealable, but only if the applicable order relates to the HSR Act or any other
competition, merger control, antitrust or similar law or regulation; or

 

 

•  if the Merger will not have been consummated by the end date and at the time of such termination, provided all of the
conditions to closing of Cintas, Merger Sub and G&K set forth in the merger agreement have been satisfied (other than
(x) (1) expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or any extension thereof) under the HSR Act and
obtaining Competition Act Approval, and (2) the condition that no governmental entity of competent jurisdiction shall
have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any law that is in effect and restrains, enjoins or otherwise
prohibits consummation of the Merger (only if the applicable order relates to the HSR Act or any other competition,
merger control, antitrust or similar law or regulation), and (y) conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
closing, but that are capable of being satisfied if the closing were to occur on the date of such termination).

The reverse termination fee to be paid by Cintas under the merger agreement, if necessary, shall be paid on the second
business day immediately following the date of such termination. However, no reverse termination fee shall be payable by Cintas
as described above in the event that the failure of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement to be satisfied is a result of
G&K’s breach of its obligations to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate and make the Merger effective as required in the
merger agreement (other than an immaterial breach). See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Reverse Termination Fee.”

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND THE MERGER

The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the annual meeting and the
proposals to be voted on at the annual meeting. These questions and answers may not address all of the questions that may be
important to you as a shareholder of the Company. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy
statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement,
which you should read carefully and in their entirety. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement without charge by following the instructions under the section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”

 
Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
 

A: You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Company Board in favor of the
proposal to approve the merger agreement among other proposals to be voted on at the annual meeting. The Company entered
into a definitive agreement providing for the Merger of Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cintas, with and into the
Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Cintas. As a result, the Company will, among
other things, become a wholly owned subsidiary of Cintas and no longer be listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

 
Q: When and where is the annual meeting?
 

A: The annual meeting will be held at 5995 Opus Parkway, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343, on November 15, 2016, at 10:00 a.m.,
local time (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the “annual meeting”).

 
Q: Who is entitled to vote at the annual meeting?
 

A: Only holders of record of G&K common stock as of the close of business on September 26, 2016 (the “record date”) are entitled
to receive these proxy materials and to vote their shares at the annual meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there
were 19,721,644 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the annual meeting, held by 637 holders of record.
Each share of G&K common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date will be entitled to one vote on each matter
submitted to a vote at the annual meeting.

 
Q: What matters will be voted on at the annual meeting?
 

A: You will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:

1. to approve the merger agreement;

2. to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s
named executive officers in connection with the Merger, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of this proxy
statement entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”;

3. to approve the adjournment of the annual meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the annual meeting to approve the proposal to approve the merger agreement or in the absence of
a quorum;

4. to elect the three Class III directors named in the attached proxy statement to serve for terms of three years;

5. to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, as our independent auditors for fiscal
year 2017; and

6. to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers.

Table of Contents

Q: May I attend the annual meeting and vote in person?
 

A: Yes. All shareholders as of the record date may attend the annual meeting and vote in person. Even if you plan to attend the
annual meeting in person, we encourage you to complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy or vote electronically over the
Internet or via telephone to ensure that your shares will be represented at the annual meeting. If you attend the annual meeting and
wish to vote in person, you must deliver to our Secretary a written revocation of any proxy you previously submitted, as your vote
by ballot will not revoke any proxy previously submitted. If you hold your shares in “street name,” because you are not the
shareholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the annual meeting unless you request and obtain a valid proxy
from your broker, bank or other nominee.

 
Q: How many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?
 

A: A quorum, consisting of the holders of a majority of G&K common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the annual
meeting, is required for the transaction of business at the annual meeting. Such quorum must be present, either in person or
represented by proxy, for the transaction of business at the annual meeting, except as otherwise required by law, our Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation or our Amended and Restated Bylaws.

If a quorum is not present at the annual meeting, the annual meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a
quorum is obtained.

As of September 26, 2016, the record date for the annual meeting, there were 19,721,644 shares of common stock outstanding.

If you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your
shares will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the annual meeting.

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee (“Nominee”) and you do not instruct your
Nominee on how you wish to vote your shares, a broker non-vote will occur with respect to each of the proposals other than the
auditor ratification proposal. As a result, (i) your shares will be counted for the purpose of establishing a quorum at the annual
meeting, but (ii) your Nominee may not vote your shares on the proposal to approve the merger agreement, the advisory (non-
binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the
Company in connection with the Merger, the adjournment proposal, the election of directors or the advisory (non-binding)
proposal to approve executive compensation, but may vote your shares, in its discretion, on the auditor ratification proposal. A
broker non-vote will have the effect of a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement, no effect in the
election of directors proposal and will reduce the number of shares necessary to approve the advisory (non-binding) proposal to
approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection
with the Merger, the adjournment proposal and the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve executive compensation.

 
Q: What vote of G&K shareholders is required to approve the merger agreement?
 

A: Adoption of the merger agreement requires that shareholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote at
the annual meeting vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of common stock or
an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement. If you
hold your shares in “street name” through your Nominee and you do not instruct the Nominee how to vote your shares, such
failure to instruct your Nominee will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

Q: What vote of G&K shareholders is required to approve the other proposals to be voted upon at the annual meeting?
 

A: Election of Directors: Each nominee must be elected by a majority of the votes cast, where the number of votes cast “FOR” a
nominee exceeds the number of votes cast “AGAINST” a nominee.

All Other Proposals (other than the merger agreement and election of directors proposals): The affirmative vote of the holders of
the greater of (i) a majority of the voting power of shares present and entitled to vote on that item of business or (ii) a majority of
the voting power of the minimum number of shares entitled to vote that would constitute a quorum for the transaction of business
at the annual meeting.

 
Q: How does the Company Board recommend that I vote?
 

A: The Company Board recommends that G&K shareholders vote;
 

 •  “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger agreement;
 

 
•  “FOR” the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to

the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the Merger;
 

 •  “FOR” the proposal regarding adjournment of the annual meeting;
 

 •  “FOR” the election of each of the Class III directors;
 

 •  “FOR” the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve executive compensation; and
 

 •  “FOR” the proposal to ratify KPMG as independent registered public accounting firm.

For a discussion of the factors that the Company Board considered in determining to recommend the approval of the merger
agreement, please see the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Reasons for Recommending the Approval of the Merger
Agreement.” In addition, in considering the recommendation of the Company Board with respect to the merger agreement, you
should be aware that some of our directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the
interests of G&K shareholders generally. For a discussion of these interests, please see the section entitled “The Merger (Proposal
1) — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

 
Q: How do G&K’s directors and officers intend to vote?
 

A: We currently expect that the Company’s directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve
the merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the annual meeting.

 
Q: When is the Merger expected to be completed?
 

A: As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to consummate the Merger not later than the second quarter of calendar year
2017. However, the completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the
Merger, which are described in this proxy statement and include various regulatory clearances and approvals. It is possible that
factors outside the control of G&K or Cintas could delay the completion of the Merger, or prevent it from being completed at all.
There may be a substantial amount of time between the annual meeting and the completion of the Merger.

 
Q: What happens if the Merger is not completed?
 

A: If the merger agreement is not approved by the Company’s shareholders, or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason,
the Company’s shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common

stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain a public company, and shares of G&K common stock will
continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as well as listed and traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. In the event
that either G&K or Cintas terminates the merger agreement, then, in certain circumstances, G&K will pay Cintas a termination fee
in an amount equal to $60 million. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fee.” In certain other
circumstances, Cintas will be required to pay a reverse termination fee in an amount equal to $100 million following termination
by either G&K or Cintas. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Reverse Termination Fee.”

 
Q: What will happen if shareholders do not approve the advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that may

be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
 

A: The inclusion of this proposal is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules; however, the approval of
this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger and the vote on this proposal is an advisory vote by shareholders
and will not be binding on the Company or Cintas. If the merger agreement is approved by the Company’s shareholders and the
Merger is completed, the Merger-related compensation may be paid to the Company’s named executive officers in accordance
with the terms of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if shareholders fail to approve this proposal.

 
Q: What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of common stock?
 

A: We urge you to read this entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated by reference in
this proxy statement, and to consider how the Merger affects you. Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of
common stock you own.

Voting in Person

Shareholders of record will be able to vote in person at the annual meeting. If you are not a shareholder of record but instead hold
your shares of common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide a legal proxy executed
in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the annual meeting.

It is not necessary to attend the annual meeting in order to vote your shares. To ensure that your shares of common stock are voted
at the annual meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the
annual meeting in person.

Attending the meeting in person does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.

Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder

You can also ensure that your shares are voted at the annual meeting by submitting your proxy via:
 

 •  mail, by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope;
 

 •  telephone, by using the toll-free number listed on each proxy card; or
 

 •  the Internet, at the Internet address provided on each proxy card.

If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote with respect to a proposal, your proxy will
be voted “FOR” (1) the proposal to approve the merger agreement, (2) the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain
compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the
Merger, (3) the proposal to adjourn the annual meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there
are insufficient

votes at the time of the annual meeting to approve the proposal to approve the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum,
(4) the proposal to elect three Class III directors named in the attached proxy statement to serve for terms of three years, (5) the
proposal to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent auditors for fiscal year 2017, and (6) the advisory (non-
binding) proposal to approve the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers.

Street Name

If your shares of common stock are held by a Nominee on your behalf in “street name,” your Nominee will send you instructions
as to how to provide voting instructions for your shares. Many brokerage firms and banks have a process for their customers to
provide voting instructions by telephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a voting instruction
form.

If you do not instruct your Nominee on how you wish to vote your shares, a broker non-vote will occur with respect to each of the
proposals other than the auditor ratification proposal. As a result, (i) your shares will be counted for the purpose of establishing a
quorum at the annual meeting, but (ii) your Nominee may not vote your shares on the proposal to approve the merger agreement,
the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive
officers of the Company in connection with the Merger, the adjournment proposal, the election of directors or the advisory (non-
binding) proposal to approve executive compensation, but may vote your shares, in its discretion, on the auditor ratification
proposal. A broker non-vote will have the effect of a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement, no effect
in the election of directors proposal and will reduce the number of shares necessary to approve the advisory (non-binding)
proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in
connection with the Merger, the adjournment proposal and the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve executive
compensation.

 
Q: Can I revoke my proxy?
 

A: Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the annual meeting. If you are a shareholder of record, you
may revoke your proxy by notifying the Company’s Secretary in writing to the Company in care of the Corporate Secretary at
5995 Opus Parkway, Suite 500, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343, or by submitting a new proxy by telephone, the Internet or mail,
in each case, in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card and dated after the date of the proxy being revoked.
In addition, you may revoke your proxy by attending the annual meeting and voting in person; however, simply attending the
annual meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked. Please note that if you hold your shares in “street name” and you have
instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, you should instead follow the instructions received from your
broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your prior voting instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may also
revoke a prior proxy by voting in person at the annual meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker,
bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the annual meeting.

 
Q: What happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?
 

A: The requisite number of shares to approve the merger agreement is based on the total number of shares of common stock
outstanding on the record date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do not vote or abstain from voting on the proposal to
approve the merger agreement, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement.

If a shareholder does not vote or abstains from voting for a particular director nominee, such abstention will not count as an
affirmative vote “FOR” or “AGAINST” such nominee and, therefore, will have no effect on the proposal. All other proposals
must be approved by the greater of (i) a majority of the voting power of shares present and entitled to vote on that item of
business or (ii) a majority of the voting power of the

Table of Contents

minimum number of shares entitled to vote that would constitute a quorum. If you abstain from voting on any such proposal, your
shares will be considered to be present and entitled to vote on that proposal and will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
that proposal. However, if you do not vote on any such proposal, your shares will not be considered present at the shareholders
meeting and your failure to vote will reduce the number of shares needed to approve that proposal.

 
Q: Will my shares of common stock held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting

purposes with shares I hold of record?
 

A: No. Because any shares of common stock you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different shareholder
(that is, your bank, broker or other nominee) than any shares of common stock you hold of record, any shares of common stock
held in “street name” will not be combined for voting purposes with shares of common stock you hold of record. Similarly, if you
own shares of common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for
a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of common stock because they
are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of common stock held by a corporation or business entity must be voted
by an authorized officer of the entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the proxy card. Shares of
common stock held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account. This means that, to
ensure all your shares are voted at the annual meeting, you should read carefully any proxy materials received from your bank,
broker or other nominee and follow the instructions included therewith.

 
Q: What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?
 

A: If your shares of common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one
proxy or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards and voting instruction cards you receive (or
submit each of your proxies by telephone or the Internet, if available to you) to ensure that all of your shares of common stock are
voted.

 
Q: What happens if I sell my shares of common stock before completion of the Merger?
 

A: In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of common stock through completion of the Merger.
Consequently, if you transfer your shares of common stock before completion of the Merger, you will have transferred your right
to receive the merger consideration in the Merger.

The record date for shareholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting is earlier than the completion of the Merger. If you transfer
your shares of common stock after the record date but before the completion of the Merger, you will have the right to vote at the
annual meeting but not the right to receive the merger consideration.

 
Q: Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
 

A: No. If the Merger is completed and your shares of G&K common stock are held in certificated form, you will receive a letter of
transmittal and related materials from the paying agent for the Merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your
shares of common stock evidenced by stock certificates for the merger consideration. If your shares of common stock are held in
“street name” by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to
what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for the merger
consideration. If your shares are held in book entry form, you will not need to deliver to the paying agent an executed letter of
transmittal or stock certificates in order to receive the merger consideration, but will have to comply with the terms and conditions
imposed by the paying agent in order to effect an orderly exchange of such book entry shares in accordance with normal exchange
procedures. Do not send in your certificates now.

Q: What is householding and how does it affect me?
 

A: The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more shareholders reside,
unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures
(“householding”). In such cases, each shareholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain
brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If your
family has multiple accounts holding common stock, you may have already received householding notification from your broker.
Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will
arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any
time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.

 
Q: Where can I find more information about G&K?
 

A: You can find more information about us from various sources described in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Where You
Can Find Additional Information.”

 
Q: Can I access these materials on the Internet?
 

A: Yes. These proxy materials are available at www.gkservices.com in PDF and HTML format.

 
Q: Who can help answer my other questions?
 

A: If you have more questions about the Merger, or require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need
additional copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact D.F. King & Co., Inc., which is acting as the
proxy solicitation agent for the Company in connection with the Merger, or the Company.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This proxy statement, and the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, contains “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Exchange Act. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such
as statements about the potential timing or consummation of the proposed transaction or the anticipated benefits thereof, including,
without limitation, future financial and operating results. Forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as “estimates,”
“anticipates,” “projects,” “plans,” “expects,” “intends,” “believes,” “seeks,” “could,” “should,” “may” and “will” or the negative
versions thereof and similar expressions and by the context in which they are used. Such statements are based upon our current
expectations and speak only as of the date made. These statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors that could
cause actual results to differ from those set forth in or implied by this proxy statement and the documents incorporated by reference in
this proxy statement. Factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties related to:
 

 
•  the ability to obtain the requisite company vote and regulatory approvals, or the possibility that they may delay the Merger or

that such regulatory approval may result in the imposition of conditions that could cause the parties to abandon the Merger;
 

 •  the risk that a condition to closing of the Merger may not be satisfied;
 

 
•  the ability of the Company and Cintas to integrate their businesses successfully and to achieve anticipated cost savings and

other synergies;
 

 
•  the possibility that other anticipated benefits of the Merger will not be realized, including, without limitation, anticipated

revenues, expenses, earnings and other financial results, and growth and expansion of the new combined company’s
operations;

 

 •  potential litigation relating to the Merger that could be instituted against the Company or Cintas or their respective directors;
 

 
•  possible disruptions from the Merger that could harm the Company’s or Cintas’ business, including current plans and

operations;
 

 •  the ability of the Company or Cintas to retain, attract and hire key personnel;
 

 
•  potential adverse reactions or changes to relationships with clients, employees, suppliers or other parties resulting from the

announcement or completion of the Merger;
 

 
•  potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships, during the pendency of the Merger that

could affect the Company’s and/or Cintas’ financial performance;
 

 
•  certain restrictions during the pendency of the Merger that may impact the Company’s and/or Cintas’ ability to pursue

certain business opportunities or strategic transactions;
 

 •  continued availability of capital and financing and rating agency actions;
 

 •  legislative, regulatory and economic developments;
 

 
•  unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or

hostilities, as well as management’s response to any of the aforementioned factors.

and other risks detailed in our filings with the SEC, including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
July 2, 2016, and other documents filed by G&K with the SEC after the date thereof. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find
Additional Information.”

Many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict. In light of the significant
uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements contained herein, readers should not

levels of activity, performance or achievements. While the list of factors presented here is considered representative, no such list should
be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional
obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those

loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s or Cintas’
consolidated financial condition, results of operations, credit rating or liquidity. Neither the Company nor Cintas undertake any
obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date on which they are made,
except as required by law.

THE ANNUAL MEETING

We are furnishing this proxy statement to the Company’s shareholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Company Board
for use at the annual meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. This proxy statement provides the Company’s shareholders
with the information they need to know to be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the annual meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

Date, Time and Place of the Annual Meeting

This proxy statement is being furnished to our shareholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Company Board for use at
the annual meeting to be held at 5995 Opus Parkway, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343, on November 15, 2016, at 10:00 a.m., local time,
or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

Purposes of the Annual Meeting

At the annual meeting, G&K shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 

 •  to approve the merger agreement;
 

 

•  to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s
named executive officers in connection with the Merger, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of this
proxy statement entitled “The Merger (Proposal 1) —Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger”;

 

 
•  to approve the adjournment of the annual meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there

are insufficient votes at the time of the annual meeting to approve the proposal to approve the merger agreement or in the
absence of a quorum;

 

 •  to elect the three Class III directors named in this proxy statement to serve for terms of three years;
 

 
•  to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, as our independent auditors for

fiscal year 2017; and
 

 •  to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers.

Our shareholders must approve the merger agreement, by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of
all shares entitled to vote, for the Merger to occur. If our shareholders fail to approve the merger agreement, the Merger will not occur.
A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, and the material provisions of the merger agreement
are described in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement.”

The vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the Merger is a vote separate and apart from the vote to approve
the merger agreement. Accordingly, a shareholder may vote to approve the executive compensation and vote not to approve the merger
agreement and vice versa. Because the vote on executive compensation is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either the
Company or Cintas. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by the Company’s shareholders and the Merger is completed, the
Merger-related compensation may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in accordance with the terms
of their compensation agreements or arrangements even if the shareholders fail to approve the proposal.

G&K does not expect a vote to be taken on matters other than those specified above at the annual meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof. If any other matters are properly presented at the annual meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof
for consideration, however, the holders of the proxies will have discretion to vote on these matters in accordance with their best
judgment.

Table of Contents

This proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy are first being mailed to our shareholders on or about October 3, 2016.

Record Date and Quorum

Only shareholders of record at the close of business on the record date will be entitled to vote at the annual meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof. As of the close of business on September 26, 2016, the record date for the annual meeting,
19,721,644 shares of common stock were outstanding.

A quorum, consisting of the holders of a majority of G&K common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the annual
meeting, is required for the transaction of business at the annual meeting. Such quorum must be present, either in person or represented
by proxy, for the transaction of business at the annual meeting, except as otherwise required by law, our Amended and Restated
Articles of Incorporation or our Amended and Restated Bylaws.

All shares entitled to vote and represented by properly executed proxies received prior to the annual meeting, and not revoked,
will be voted as instructed on those proxies. If no instructions are indicated, those shares will be voted as recommended by the
Company Board. If any director nominee is unable to serve or for good cause will not serve, the proxies which would have otherwise
been voted for that director nominee may be voted for a substitute director nominee selected by the Company Board.

Required Vote

Each share of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote on each of the
proposals to be considered at the annual meeting.

The required vote for each of the proposals is as follows:
 

 
•  Approval of the Merger Agreement: The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the outstanding

shares of the Company’s common stock entitled to vote thereon is required to approve the merger agreement.
 

 

•  Advisory (Non-Binding) Vote on Merger-Related Compensation: The affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of (i) a
majority of the voting power of shares present and entitled to vote on that item of business or (ii) a majority of the voting
power of the minimum number of shares entitled to vote that would constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the
annual meeting is required to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the Merger-related compensation payments.

 

 

•  Adjournment of the Annual Meeting: The affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of (i) a majority of the voting power
of shares present and entitled to vote on that item of business or (ii) a majority of the voting power of the minimum number
of shares entitled to vote that would constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the annual meeting is required to
approve the adjournment of the annual meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes to approve the merger agreement.

 

 

•  Election of Directors: Each nominee must be elected by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of shares entitled to vote
in the election at the meeting, where the number of votes cast “FOR” a nominee exceeds the number of votes cast
“AGAINST” a nominee. In a contested election, the vote required for the election of directors is a plurality of votes cast. In
the event an incumbent director does not receive a sufficient number of the votes cast for re-election, our Corporate
Governance Guidelines require that the director promptly offer to tender his or her resignation to the Company Board. Our
Corporate Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Company Board on whether to accept or reject the
offer. The Company Board, taking into account the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee, will decide
whether to accept or reject the offer, and will publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days after
the date of the election.

Table of Contents

 

•  Appointment of the Company’s Independent Public Accountant: The affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of (i) a
majority of the voting power of shares present and entitled to vote on that item of business or (ii) a majority of the voting
power of the minimum number of shares entitled to vote that would constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the
annual meeting is required for the appointment of KPMG LLP.

 

 

•  Advisory (Non-Binding) Vote on Executive Compensation: The affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of (i) a majority
of the voting power of shares present and entitled to vote on that item of business or (ii) a majority of the voting power of the
minimum number of shares entitled to vote that would constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the annual
meeting is required to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of the Company’s named executive
officers. The Compensation Committee of the Company Board, which is responsible for designing and administering our
executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by shareholders in their vote and will consider the outcome
of the vote when making future compensation decisions for named executive officers

 

 

•  Other Proposals: The affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of (i) a majority of the voting power of shares present and
entitled to vote on that item of business or (ii) a majority of the voting power of the minimum number of shares entitled to
vote that would constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the annual meeting is required for approval of any
other proposal to be voted upon at the annual meeting.

As of the record date, there were 19,721,644 shares of common stock outstanding and 637 record holders.

Voting by the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers

At the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of the Company were entitled to vote 385,856 shares
of common stock, or approximately 1.96% of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding on that date. We currently expect that
the Company’s directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement and all
other proposals to be considered at the annual meeting, although they have no obligation to do so.

Voting; Proxies; Revocation

Attendance

All holders of shares of common stock as of the close of business on September 26, 2016, the record date, including shareholders
of record and beneficial owners of common stock registered in the “street name” of a broker, bank or other nominee, are invited to
attend the annual meeting. If you are a shareholder of record, please be prepared to provide proper identification, such as a driver’s
license. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you will need to provide proof of ownership, such as a recent account statement or
voting instruction form provided by your broker, bank or other nominee or other similar evidence of ownership, along with proper
identification.

Voting in Person

Shareholders of record will be able to vote in person at the annual meeting. If you are not a shareholder of record, but instead hold
your shares of common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide a legal proxy executed in
your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the annual meeting. Attending the meeting
in person does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.

Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy

To ensure that your shares of common stock are voted at the annual meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions
promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the annual meeting in person.

Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder

If you are a shareholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods described below.

Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with instructions for
submitting voting instructions. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the Internet by accessing the Internet
address specified on the enclosed proxy card. Your shares of common stock will be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you
had completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy card, as described below.

Submit a Proxy Card. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received in time for the
annual meeting, your shares of common stock will be voted in the manner directed by you on your proxy card.

If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of each of
(1) the proposal to approve the merger agreement, (2) the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be
paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the Merger, (3) the proposal to adjourn the
annual meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the
annual meeting to approve the proposal to approve the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum, (4) the proposal to elect three
Class III directors named in the attached proxy statement to serve for terms of three years, (5) the proposal to ratify the appointment of
KPMG LLP as our independent auditors for fiscal year 2017, and (6) the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve the compensation
of the Company’s named executive officers. If you fail to return your proxy card or vote in person, the effect will be that your
shares of common stock will not be considered present at the annual meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is
present at the annual meeting, (i) will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger
agreement, (ii) assuming a quorum is present, will reduce the number of shares required to approve (A) the advisory (non-
binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the
Company in connection with the Merger, (B) the vote regarding the adjournment of the annual meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the annual meeting to approve
the proposal to approve the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum, (C) the proposal to ratify the appointment of
KPMG LLP as our independent auditors for fiscal year 2017, or (D) the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve the
compensation of the Company’s named executive officers, and (iii) will not count as a vote “FOR” or “AGAINST” the proposal
to elect the three Class III director nominees and, therefore, will have no effect on that proposal.

Shares of Common Stock Held in “Street Name”

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a Nominee, your Nominee will send you instructions as to how to provide voting
instructions for your shares. Many brokerage firms and banks have a process for their customers to provide voting instructions by
telephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a voting instruction form.

If you do not instruct your Nominee on how you wish to vote your shares, a broker non-vote will occur with respect to each of the
proposals other than the auditor ratification proposal. As a result, (i) your shares will be

Table of Contents

counted for the purpose of establishing a quorum at the annual meeting, but (ii) your Nominee may not vote your shares on the
proposal to approve the merger agreement, the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or
become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the Merger, the adjournment proposal, the election
of directors or the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve executive compensation, but may vote your shares, in its discretion, on
the auditor ratification proposal. A broker non-vote will have the effect of a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger
agreement, no effect in the election of directors proposal and will reduce the number of shares necessary to approve the advisory (non-
binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the
Company in connection with the Merger, the adjournment proposal and the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve executive
compensation.

Revocation of Proxies

Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it at any time before it is voted. If you
are a shareholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the annual meeting by:
 

 
•  submitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures described above,

or by completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to the Company;
 

 
•  attending the annual meeting and voting in person; however, simply attending the annual meeting will not cause your proxy

to be revoked; or
 

 
•  delivering a written notice of revocation by mail to the Company in care of the Corporate Secretary at 5995 Opus Parkway,

Suite 500, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343.

Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the annual meeting without taking one of the actions
described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to
the Company or by sending a written notice of revocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or
written notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company before the annual meeting.

Please note that if you hold your shares in “street name” and you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your
shares, you should instead follow the instructions received from your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your prior voting
instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may also revoke a prior proxy by voting in person at the annual meeting if
you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the annual
meeting.

Abstentions

An abstention occurs when a shareholder attends a meeting, either in person or is represented by proxy, but abstains from voting.
Abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares of common stock present or represented at the annual meeting
for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved. Abstaining from voting will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to approve the merger agreement. If a shareholder does not vote or abstains from voting for a particular
director nominee, such abstention will not count as an affirmative vote “FOR” or “AGAINST” such nominee and, therefore, will have
no effect on the proposal. The requisite number of shares to approve the other proposals is based on the total number of shares
represented in person or represented by proxy with respect to such proposals; if you abstain from voting with respect to such proposals,
such abstention will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” such proposals.

Solicitation of Proxies

The Company Board is soliciting your proxy, and the Company will bear the cost of this solicitation of proxies. This includes the
charges and expenses of brokerage firms and others for forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners of G&K’s common stock.
The Company has retained D.F. King & Co., Inc., a proxy solicitation firm, to assist the Company Board in the solicitation of proxies
for the annual meeting, and we expect to pay D.F. King & Co., Inc. approximately $12,500, plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses. Proxies may be solicited by mail, personal interview, e-mail, telephone, or via the Internet by D.F. King & Co., Inc. or,
without additional compensation, by certain of the Company’s directors, officers and employees.

Other Information

You should not return your stock certificate or send documents representing common stock with the proxy card. If the
Merger is completed, the paying agent for the Merger will send you a letter of transmittal and related materials and instructions for
exchanging your certificates representing shares of common stock for the merger consideration. No holder of non-certificated shares
represented by book-entry, which we refer to as “book-entry shares” in this proxy statement, will be required to deliver a certificate or,
in the case of book-entry shares held through the Depositary Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal, to the paying agent to
receive the merger consideration.

THE MERGER (PROPOSAL 1)

The description of the Merger in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
complete text of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the Merger that is
important to you. You are encouraged to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety.

Certain Effects of the Merger

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company
surviving the Merger.

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of G&K common stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than the excluded shares) will be converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration.

G&K common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under
the symbol “GK.”

Per Share Merger Consideration

The merger consideration will be $97.50 per share in cash, without interest, and subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

Background of the Merger

In addition to its regularly scheduled meetings, the Company Board and its senior management met from time to time, including
formally on an annual basis, to, among other things, evaluate G&K’s business and long-term strategic goals and plans, and to review,
consider and assess, in the context of G&K’s operations, financial performance and industry conditions, potential opportunities for
business combinations and mergers, joint ventures and other collaborations, acquisitions, a sale of the company, alternatives for
returning capital to G&K’s shareholders and other financial and strategic alternatives. Stinson Leonard Street LLP (“Stinson”), as
longstanding legal counsel to G&K, and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (“BofA Merrill Lynch”), the Company’s
financial advisor, participated in certain of these discussions and assisted the Company Board and its senior management with such
reviews. Over time, as part of this routine process, the financial and strategic alternatives reviewed by the Company Board have
included G&K’s continued execution of its strategic plan as an independent, standalone company, special dividends, share buybacks,
acquisitions, a strategic merger, a leveraged buy-out and a sale of the Company.

Consistent with these efforts, Douglas A. Milroy, G&K’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, periodically throughout the last
several years met with representatives of industry participants other than Cintas, including Company A and Company B, to explore
potential strategic opportunities. None of these discussions led to anything actionable by G&K.

On December 2, 2015, Scott D. Farmer, Cintas’ Chief Executive Officer, contacted Mr. Milroy to request a meeting to discuss the
potential combination of G&K and Cintas. Mr. Milroy advised Mr. Ernest J. Mrozek, G&K’s lead independent director, Jeffrey L.
Cotter, G&K’s Vice President, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary, Tracy C. Jokinen, G&K’s Chief Financial Officer, and
representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch on December 2, 2015 of Mr. Farmer’s call, and Mr. Milroy scheduled a meeting of the Company
Board on December 6, 2015.

A telephonic meeting of the Company Board was held on December 6, 2015, which was also attended by members of G&K’s
senior management and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch. Mr. Milroy updated the Company Board on Mr. Farmer’s request for a
meeting, and indicated that, based on Mr. Farmer’s comments, he believed that Mr. Farmer might propose a strategic transaction
between G&K and Cintas. Mr. Milroy also updated the Company Board about his previously scheduled meeting with the Chief
Executive Officer of Company A to be held the following day on December 7, 2015. The independent directors also met in executive
session with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch without management present. At the conclusion of the meeting, the Company
Board directed Mr. Milroy to meet with Mr. Farmer.

On December 7, 2015, Mr. Milroy met with the Chief Executive Officer of Company A to discuss, among other things, a potential
strategic transaction between G&K and Company A. Mr. Milroy’s meeting with the Chief Executive Officer of Company A was
scheduled prior to Cintas’ December 2, 2015 call to Mr. Milroy. The Chief Executive Officer of Company A indicated that Company A
was not interested in exploring a strategic transaction with G&K.

On December 8, 2015, Mr. Milroy contacted Mr. Farmer to make arrangements for the meeting requested by Mr. Farmer. Messrs.
Milroy and Farmer agreed to meet on January 12, 2016 in the Minneapolis area.

Also in December 2015, the Company Board formed a working group (the “working group”) consisting of Mr. Milroy, Ms.
Jokinen, Mr. Cotter, Mr. Mrozek and Wayne M. Fortun, another independent member of the Company Board with experience in
negotiated transactions, together with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch in an advisory capacity. The purpose of the working group
was to facilitate board level input and oversight for any negotiations that may take place with Cintas. On January 6, 2016, the working
group met in person, with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, to discuss and prepare for Mr. Milroy’s January 12, 2016 meeting
with Mr. Farmer.

On January 12, 2016, Mr. Farmer met with Mr. Milroy as scheduled. At the meeting, Mr. Farmer proposed in writing that Cintas
acquire all of the outstanding common shares of G&K for $76.00 per share in cash. Mr. Milroy said he would discuss Cintas’ proposal
with the Company Board.

On January 17, 2016, a telephonic meeting of the Company Board was held, which was attended by members of G&K senior
management and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and Stinson. Mr. Milroy updated the Company Board on his meeting with
Mr. Farmer and the $76.00 per share proposal. Representatives of Stinson reviewed with the Company Board its fiduciary duties in
connection with an evaluation of an unsolicited offer to acquire the Company, and, if at a later date, the Company Board decided to
pursue a sale of the Company, its fiduciary duties in connection with such a sale. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch also discussed
and reviewed with the Company Board the financial aspects of the proposal, including the perceived financial ability of Cintas to
improve on the proposal, obtain financing and consummate the transaction. Following deliberation, the Company Board unanimously
determined to reject the proposal because it was inadequate and instructed Mr. Milroy and the working group to respond to Cintas
accordingly.

On January 18, 2016, the working group met telephonically, with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, to prepare a response to
the Cintas proposal. On January 19, 2016, Mr. Milroy contacted Mr. Farmer to convey the Company Board’s decision to reject the
proposal.

On February 3 and February 4, 2016, the Company Board held at a regularly scheduled board meeting, which was attended by
members of the Company’s senior management. At the meeting, Ms. Jokinen presented the Company’s long-term business plan,
discussed risks and opportunities associated with the Company’s operations and the Company’s second quarter results. Representatives
of BofA Merrill Lynch and Stinson also attended a portion of the meeting. As part of the Company Board’s regular annual review of
strategic alternatives, at the request of the Company Board, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch discussed, among other things,
potential strategic transactions with various third parties.

On March 21, 2016, in accordance with the Company Board’s continuing efforts to explore financial and strategic alternatives,
Mr. Milroy met with the Chief Executive Officer of Company B. Mr. Milroy and the Chief

Executive Officer of Company B discussed, among other things, a strategic transaction between G&K and Company B. The Chief
Executive Officer of Company B indicated that he would relay his conversation with Mr. Milroy to certain members of Company B’s
board of directors.

On April 5, 2016, Mr. Milroy again met with the Chief Executive Officer of Company A. During this meeting, Mr. Milroy and the
Chief Executive Officer of Company A discussed a potential strategic transaction between G&K and Company A. In response, the
Chief Executive Officer of Company A confirmed that Company A was not interested in pursuing a strategic transaction with G&K.

On April 15, 2016, Mr. Milroy called the Chief Executive Officer of Company B to follow-up on their earlier discussions. In
response to Mr. Milroy’s call, the Chief Executive Officer of Company B indicated that Company B was not interested in pursuing a
strategic transaction with G&K at this time.

On May 5, 2016, Mr. Milroy and Mr. Farmer had a telephone call, which Mr. Farmer initiated. During the call, Mr. Farmer
requested a meeting with G&K with himself and J. Michael Hansen, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Cintas. Mr. Farmer
indicated that he and Mr. Hansen had, since the parties last spoke, performed additional analysis and modeling of a potential strategic
transaction between the two companies and that he would like to discuss their analysis with Mr. Milroy. Mr. Milroy preliminarily
agreed to a meeting between the representatives of the two companies on May 12, 2016, subject to Mr. Mrozek’s concurrence, which
was subsequently obtained.

On May 12, 2016, Mr. Milroy met with Messrs. Farmer and Hansen. At the meeting, Mr. Farmer presented a proposal to acquire
all of the outstanding common shares of G&K for $86.00 per share in cash and confirmed the offer in writing. The written proposal
indicated that the $86.00 per share price represented a 49% premium to G&K’s 52-week low share price on January 19, 2016. The
working group, with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, convened a telephonic meeting later that same day to discuss Cintas’
revised proposal, which the working group agreed should be presented to the Company Board at its subsequently scheduled meeting on
May 21, 2016.

Pursuant to a letter agreement, dated May 12, 2016, G&K formally retained BofA Merrill Lynch as its financial advisor in
connection with a potential transaction. In connection with the Company’s engagement of BofA Merrill Lynch as the Company’s
financial advisor, BofA Merrill Lynch provided the Company with information regarding certain relationships BofA Merrill Lynch and
its affiliates had with Cintas, including that, during the preceding two-year period, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates had provided
investment and corporate banking services to Cintas and earned revenues for such services. The amount of such revenues during such
period was less than $200,000.

On May 21, 2016, a telephonic meeting of the Company Board was held, which was attended by members of G&K senior
management and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and Stinson. Mr. Milroy updated the Company Board on the May 12th
proposal from Cintas, and his recent meetings with the respective Chief Executive Officers of Company A and Company B. At the
meeting, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch presented various preliminary analyses with respect to a proposed transaction between
G&K and Cintas. Ms. Jokinen also provided an update on key internal and external trends affecting the Company’s business and the
associated opportunities and risks with the Company’s long-term business plan. Following discussion, the Company Board determined
that Cintas’ $86.00 per share proposal was inadequate, that the Company Board would not make a counter offer to Cintas at a specific
price, and that Cintas would have to further increase its proposed price if the Company Board were to consider engaging in discussions
regarding a possible transaction with Cintas.

On May 24, 2016, Mr. Milroy had a discussion with Mr. Farmer during which he conveyed the Company Board’s views
concerning Cintas’ $86.00 per share offer. Mr. Milroy emphasized the Company Board’s view that the proposal was inadequate given
G&K’s value as a standalone entity, the potential synergies from a combination and the lack of comparable opportunities for Cintas.
Mr. Milroy also emphasized that the Cintas offer did not adequately reflect prevailing premiums and the accretive nature for Cintas of
an acquisition of G&K.

On June 3, 2016, Mr. Farmer called Mr. Milroy and requested a meeting with representatives of G&K to discuss potential
synergies in a proposed transaction and other matters in order to assist Cintas in determining whether or not it was able to make an
improved offer.

On June 6, 2016, the working group, with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, met to consider Mr. Farmer’s request for a
meeting and to develop a recommendation for the Company Board. The working group recommended that Mr. Milroy proceed with the
meeting subject to obtaining a non-disclosure agreement and standstill prior to any such meeting.

On June 9, 2016, the Company Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss Mr. Farmer’s request for a meeting, which was
attended by members of G&K senior management and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and Stinson. Mr. Milroy relayed the
recommendation of the working group to proceed with a meeting, subject to obtaining a non-disclosure agreement and standstill from
Cintas prior to engaging in any such meeting. Following discussion, the Company Board agreed with the working group’s
recommendation and directed Mr. Milroy to proceed on that basis.

On June 14, 2016, Mr. Farmer and Mr. Milroy had a telephone call during which they agreed to meet on June 21, 2016 in the
Minneapolis area.

That same day, Mr. Cotter provided Mr. Thomas F. Frooman, Senior Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel of Cintas, a
draft mutual confidentiality agreement containing a standstill provision. On June 20, 2016, G&K and Cintas entered into the mutual
confidentiality agreement containing a standstill provision.

On June 21, 2016, Mr. Milroy and Ms. Jokinen met with Mr. Farmer and Mr. Hansen to discuss their respective views about
synergies that could potentially result from the proposed transaction. At this meeting, Mr. Milroy and Ms. Jokinen discussed G&K’s
view as to its potential long-term standalone value, and they emphasized the Company Board’s view that Cintas’ proposal was
inadequate given this view. Mr. Milroy and Ms. Jokinen also commented on the lack of comparable opportunities for Cintas, and the
fact that Cintas’ proposal did not reflect prevailing premiums or the accretive nature for Cintas of an acquisition of G&K.

On June 22 and 23, 2016, the Company Board held a regularly scheduled meeting in person in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Members
of G&K senior management attended the meeting, and representatives from BofA Merrill Lynch and Stinson attended portions of the
meeting. Mr. Milroy discussed the June 21, 2016 meeting with Messrs. Farmer and Hansen. Mr. Milroy indicated Mr. Farmer had
stated that he would likely provide a third revised offer but not a fourth. A representative from Stinson gave a presentation to the
Company Board on their fiduciary duties as directors. At the request of the Company Board, Mr. Cotter also provided the Company
Board with a summary of change in control provisions under employment arrangements with, and policies relating to, the Company’s
executive officers that would be triggered if a change in control of G&K occurred.

At the Company Board meeting on June 23, 2016, members of senior management summarized internal and external
opportunities and risks for G&K, various growth initiatives and related results and the recommended fiscal 2017 financial plan and the
achievability thereof. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch led a discussion regarding market and general economic conditions and
whether the timing was favorable for a sale transaction. BofA Merrill Lynch representatives reviewed Cintas’ most recent proposal and
presented various preliminary financial analyses with respect to a proposed transaction between G&K and Cintas. The Company
Board, in consultation with its advisors, discussed its view that Cintas was the most logical buyer of G&K because of, among other
things, Cintas’ existing operations, industry expertise, complementary businesses and geographic footprint, as well as the projected
cost synergies that would result from the combination, and Cintas’ strong balance sheet and financial position. The Company Board
also discussed other alternatives available to G&K, including continuing to operate as a standalone business and the fact that
discussions with Company A and Company B indicated that they were unlikely to enter into a strategic transaction with G&K. The
Company Board also discussed the benefits and risks of contacting other potential acquirers in the event the Company

Board determined to move forward with a potential sale transaction, and noted that any definitive transaction agreement would need to
be structured to allow G&K to terminate the transaction in the event G&K received a superior alternative proposal.

On June 29, 2016, Mr. Farmer contacted Mr. Milroy and presented a proposal whereby Cintas would acquire all of the
outstanding common shares of G&K for $94.00 per share in cash.

On June 30, 2016, the Company Board met telephonically, which meeting was attended by members of G&K senior management
and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and Stinson, to discuss Cintas’ most recent proposal. Representatives of BofA Merrill
Lynch presented a preliminary financial analysis of the proposal. After deliberations, the Company Board determined that Cintas’
$94.00 per share offer was inadequate and instructed Mr. Milroy to advise Mr. Farmer that, as a condition of G&K continuing to
evaluate a potential transaction with Cintas, Cintas must confirm in writing that (1) the negotiations would be held in strict confidence,
consistent with the terms of the parties’ confidentiality agreement, (2) only limited confirmatory due diligence would be required, (3)
any transaction agreement must provide for certainty of closing the transaction, (4) a definitive agreement must be reached before the
end of July 2016 and (5) the price must be greater than $100.00 per share.

On July 2, 2016, Mr. Milroy had a telephone call with Mr. Farmer during which he conveyed the Company Board’s views
concerning Cintas’ $94.00 per share proposal and requirements to engage in further discussions with Cintas.

On July 6, 2016, Cintas provided a written proposal reaffirming its interest in acquiring all of the outstanding common shares of
G&K for $94.00 per share in cash. The proposal also confirmed G&K’s requirements with respect to confidentiality and timing,
however it included an extensive due diligence request list and did not adequately address G&K’s requirement of certainty of closing
the transaction. The working group and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and Stinson met telephonically to discuss the written
proposal on the same day and further conferred about the proposal on July 7, 2016.

On July 7, 2016, the Company Board met telephonically, which meeting was attended by members of G&K senior management
and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch and Stinson. Mr. Milroy reviewed his recent conversations with Mr. Farmer and the
working group’s views on Cintas’ $94.00 per share offer. Specifically, the working group recommended that Mr. Milroy advise Mr.
Farmer that the Company Board was not prepared to further evaluate the Cintas proposal and permit due diligence unless Cintas (1)
agreed to limit due diligence to only confirmatory matters, (2) agreed to transaction terms with respect to regulatory matters that
provided for certainty and timeliness of closing the transaction and (3) increased its proposed price to an amount in excess of $100.00
per share. The Company Board agreed with this recommendation. Also at this meeting, the Company Board considered the advantages
and disadvantages of a pre-signing market check, noting that any definitive transaction agreement would need to be structured to allow
G&K to terminate the transaction in the event G&K received a superior proposal. The Company Board also noted, based in part on
input from BofA Merrill Lynch, that Cintas was the most logical buyer of G&K and that other industry participants were unlikely to
provide an offer that would exceed the value of the Cintas proposal because of, among other things, other industry participants’ capital
structure and current and historical leverage. Following these discussions, the Company Board determined that Cintas’ $94.00 per
share offer was inadequate and directed the working group to further consider conducting a pre-signing market check. Following the
meeting, the working group, with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, continued to discuss whether to conduct a pre-signing market
check, but no decision was then made with respect to whether to conduct a market check.

On July 8, 2016, Mr. Milroy advised Mr. Farmer that the Company Board had determined that Cintas’ $94.00 per share was
inadequate. Later that day, Mr. Farmer provided Mr. Milroy a written proposal to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of
G&K for $95.00 per share in cash. The proposal included a shortened due diligence request list and indicated that, subject to Cintas
completing its regulatory review of the proposed transaction, Cintas would be in a position to agree to transaction terms with respect to
regulatory matters that would provide for certainty and timeliness of closing the transaction.

From July 10, 2016 through July 21, 2016, G&K and Cintas held discussions with each other and their respective advisors and
exchanged information regarding their respective companies as part of a due diligence review of the proposed transaction, including
with respect to certain regulatory matters.

On July 22, 2016, the working group with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, met telephonically to discuss the next steps in
further negotiations with Cintas, including strategies to increase the purchase price. During this meeting, the working group discussed
the possibility of conducting a pre-signing market check and concluded not to do so based on (i) its belief that Cintas would be most
likely to offer the best combination of value and closing certainty to G&K’s shareholders, (ii) its belief that the risks of a pre-signing
market check, including the possibility of leaks, transaction delays and an adverse reaction by Cintas, outweighed any potential
benefits and (iii) the fact that the merger agreement would be structured to allow G&K to terminate the transaction in the event G&K
received a superior alternative proposal.

On July 25, 2016, Messrs. Milroy and Farmer spoke by telephone, and Mr. Milroy stated that he did not believe the Company
Board would view Cintas’ $95.00 per share offer as being adequate. Mr. Farmer stated that he expected a counterproposal on price
from G&K and that Cintas was unwilling to make an offer that would meet or exceed the $100.00 per share threshold requested by the
Company Board. Later that day, Mr. Farmer delivered to Mr. Milroy a written confirmation of Cintas’ proposal to acquire all of the
outstanding common shares of G&K for $95.00 per share in cash, in which Cintas expressed its commitment to take certain actions
with respect to regulatory matters if necessary to provide for certainty and timeliness of closing the transaction, in accordance with
ongoing discussions among the parties and their respective advisors.

On July 26, 2016, the working group, with representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, representatives of Weil, Gotshal & Manges
LLP (“Weil”), legal counsel for G&K, and Stinson, met telephonically to evaluate Cintas’ most recent proposal provided by Cintas.

From July 26, 2016 through July 28, 2016, Messrs. Milroy and Farmer communicated several times with respect to the proposed
transaction regarding, among other things, the proposed purchase price, terms with respect to regulatory matters related to certainty and
timeliness of closing the transaction and the amount and terms of a termination fee by each party in certain circumstances. At the
conclusion of these discussions, Messrs. Milroy and Farmer agreed to take a transaction at a proposed price of $97.50 per share in cash
to their respective boards of directors.

On July 28, 2016, the Company Board met telephonically, which meeting was attended by members of G&K senior management
and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, Weil and Stinson, to discuss the status of the negotiations with Cintas and to obtain the
Company Board’s input on further negotiations. After updating the Company Board on recent negotiations, Mr. Milroy advised the
Company Board that he and Mr. Farmer discussed a potential transaction at a proposed price of $97.50 per share in cash. After
discussion, the Company Board agreed to continue discussions with Cintas for a proposed transaction at $97.50 per share in cash
because, in the Company Board’s view, the offer represented a full price for the potential long-term standalone value of the Company,
the potential synergies from a combination and the lack of comparable opportunities for Cintas. The Company Board also considered
the uncertainty of being able to achieve comparable or greater value through other strategic means, and its belief, based, in part, on
input from its advisors, that after four increases Cintas would not increase the proposed price above this amount.

From July 30, 2016 to August 3, 2016, G&K, Cintas and their respective legal advisors discussed and negotiated certain
transaction terms to be included in the definitive merger agreement, including terms related to regulatory approvals and certainty and
timeliness of closing the transaction and the payment of a termination fee by each party in certain circumstances.

On August 2, 2016, the Company Board met telephonically, which meeting was attended by members of G&K senior
management and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, Weil and Stinson to update the Company

Board on the status of the negotiations with Cintas and to obtain board input on further negotiations. After discussion, the board
members agreed to continue discussions with Cintas for a proposed transaction at $97.50 per share in cash.

On August 3, 2016, Mr. Farmer delivered to Mr. Milroy a written confirmation of Cintas’ proposal to acquire all of the
outstanding common shares of G&K for $97.50 per share in cash, in which Cintas expressed its commitment to take certain actions
with respect to regulatory approvals if necessary to provide for certainty and timeliness of closing the transaction and to pay a
termination fee in certain circumstances if regulatory approval is not obtained. Also on August 3, 2016, Cintas delivered a draft of a
proposed merger agreement to G&K.

On August 4, 2016, G&K granted representatives from Cintas and Jones Day and Keating Muething & Klekamp, legal counsel to
Cintas, access to an electronic data room that contained due diligence information requested by Cintas. From August 4 through August
15, 2016, G&K, Cintas and their respective legal advisors discussed and negotiated the terms of the merger agreement, and Cintas and
its advisors continued its due diligence review of G&K. In these discussions, the parties negotiated certain transaction terms, including
terms related to regulatory approvals and certainty and timeliness of closing the transaction, the payment of a termination fee by each
party in certain circumstances, the ability of G&K to continue to pay its regular quarterly dividend during the period prior to the
closing of the transaction, and the terms of severance and other benefits for G&K employees.

On August 10, 2016, the Company Board met telephonically, which meeting was attended by members of G&K senior
management and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, Weil and Stinson. Mr. Cotter advised the Company Board of the status of
negotiations and due diligence to date. Representatives of Weil and Stinson then advised the Company Board with respect to their
fiduciary duties, the proposed terms of the merger agreement, the proposed terms of severance and other benefits for G&K officers and
other employees and a proposed by-law to designate the courts of the state of Minnesota as the exclusive forum for litigation
concerning the internal affairs of G&K. Representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch gave a preliminary financial presentation regarding the
proposed transaction.

In the afternoon of August 15, 2016, the Company Board met in person and telephonically, together with members of G&K senior
management and representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch, Weil and Stinson to consider a proposed merger transaction with Cintas at
$97.50 per share. Representatives of Weil and Stinson reviewed the directors’ fiduciary duties and provided directors with an updated
summary of the key terms of the merger agreement and the proposed exclusive forum by-law. Also at this meeting, representatives of
BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed with the Company Board its financial analysis of the $97.50 per share in cash merger consideration.
After discussion among the Company Board and its advisors, representatives of BofA Merrill Lynch delivered to the Company Board
an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 15, 2016, to the effect that, as of that date and
based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the merger consideration to be received by holders
of G&K common stock (other than the excluded shares), was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Following discussion
among the directors, after careful consideration, the Company Board unanimously (other than Thomas Greco, who had to leave the
meeting prior to the vote as a result of prior business commitments but who subsequently expressed his approval) approved the merger
agreement and the Merger, the exclusive forum by-law and related matters.

Following the Company Board meeting, during the evening of August 15, 2016, G&K and Cintas finalized and executed the
merger agreement.

On August 16, 2016, the parties issued press releases announcing execution of the merger agreement.

Reasons for Recommending the Approval of the Merger Agreement

On August 15, 2016, the Company Board unanimously (other than Thomas Greco, who had to leave the meeting prior to the vote
as a result of prior business commitments but who subsequently expressed his approval) approved the execution, delivery and
performance of the merger agreement in accordance with the MBCA (including for purposes of Section 302A.613, Subd. 1 thereof).

In evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, the Company Board
consulted with and received the advice of, the Company’s senior management team and its legal and financial advisors. In reaching its
decision, the Company Board considered and evaluated a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following factors (listed
in no particular order) that the Company Board viewed as generally supporting its decision to approve and enter into the merger
agreement and its recommendation that the Company’s shareholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal.
 

 

•  Merger Consideration; Negotiations. The Company Board believed, based in part on input from its advisors and Cintas’
statements and positions taken during the nearly eight-month period in which G&K and Cintas engaged in arm’s-length
negotiations, that, after four increases, the $97.50 per share price reflected in the Merger Agreement was the maximum
amount that Cintas was willing to pay to acquire the Company. In evaluating the per share merger consideration, the
Company Board considered a number of factors, including:

 

 •  current and historical market prices of the Company’s common stock;
 

 •  market performance of the Company’s common stock relative to those of other participants in the industry;
 

 •  general market indices and analyst expectations;
 

 

•  that the merger consideration provides an approximately 20% premium to the stock price on August 12, 2016, a
22.7% premium to the 30-trading day volume weighted average price through August 12, 2016, a 29.2% premium to
the 90-trading day volume weighted average price through August 12, 2016, a 40.3% premium to the one-year
volume weighted average price through August 12, 2016, a 43.7% premium to the two-year volume weighted average
price through August 12, 2016, a 50.3% premium to the three-year volume weighted average price through August
12, 2016, a 20.1% premium to the 52-week high for the period ending August 12, 2016, and a 68.7% premium to the
52-week low for the period ending August 12, 2016; and

 

 
•  the Company Board’s view of G&K’s potential long-term value as a standalone entity and the risks and uncertainties

associated with achieving such value;
 

 

•  Best Alternative for Maximizing Shareholder Value. The Company Board believed that the merger consideration was more
favorable to the Company’s shareholders than the potential value that could reasonably be expected to result from other
alternatives reasonably available to the Company, including the continued operation of the Company on a standalone basis
or engaging in other potential strategic transactions. In reaching this conclusion, the Company Board considered:

 

 
•  the Company’s business, assets and prospects, its competitive position and historical and projected financial

performance, and the current and expected future economic trends in the industry in which the Company operates;
and

 

 

•  the strategic and financial alternatives reasonably available to the Company as a standalone company, including
executing on the Company’s standalone plan and the lack of prospects for strategic transactions of meaningful scale
available to the Company, and the risks and uncertainties associated with those alternatives, none of which would be
likely to result in value to shareholders that would exceed, on a present-value basis, the value of the merger
consideration.

 

 
•  Other Potentially Interested Parties. The Company Board considered its view that other potential buyers were unlikely to

provide an offer that would exceed the value of the merger consideration

because of, among other things, their capital structure and current and historical leverage, but that if there were another
buyer capable of, and willing to, make such an offer to acquire the Company, such offer would not be precluded by the terms
of the merger agreement.

 
 

 
•  Strength and Complementary Nature of the Cintas Business. The Company Board believed that Cintas was most logical

acquiror of the Company based on:
 

 
•  Cintas’ existing operations, industry expertise, complementary businesses and geographic footprint, as well as the

projected cost synergies that would result from the combination;
 

 •  Cintas’ strong balance sheet and financial position; and
 

 
•  the fact that Cintas was the potential transaction partner that was most likely to offer the best combination of value

and closing certainty to the Company’s shareholders.
 

 

•  Cash Consideration; Certainty of Value. The Company Board considered the fact that the merger consideration is a fixed
cash amount that would provide shareholders with certainty of value and liquidity for their shares immediately upon the
closing of the Merger. The Company Board considered the contrast between that certainty and the risks and uncertainties
inherent in the business, including the internal and external risks associated with the Company’s standalone strategy.

 

 

•  Opinion of the Company’s Financial Advisor. The Company Board considered the opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch, dated
August 15, 2016, to the Company Board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion,
of the merger consideration to be received by holders of G&K common stock (other than excluded shares), as more fully
described below in the section entitled “—Opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch,” beginning on page 40.

 

 

•  High Probability of Completion. The Company Board believed that the highly competitive nature of the industry, the
complementary nature of the businesses of Cintas and the Company, and the efforts required under the merger agreement to
obtain regulatory approvals, among other things, all increase the likelihood that the Merger can be completed in a reasonable
time frame and reduce the potential disruption in operations.

 

 
•  No Financing Condition. The Company Board considered the fact that the Merger is not subject to a financing condition,

which further supports the likelihood that the Merger can be completed in a reasonable timeframe.
 

 
•  The Merger Agreement. The Company Board considered the general terms and conditions of the merger agreement,

including the following specific terms:
 

 

•  the fact that, under certain circumstances, the Company’s ability to terminate the merger agreement and/or change its
recommendation in connection with a superior proposal could also result in a payment by the Company of a $60
million termination fee to Cintas (as described under “The Merger Agreement—Change in Board Recommendation”
and “—Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation” beginning on pages 67 and 65, respectively);

 

 

•  the Company Board’s belief, after consulting with the Company’s outside advisors, that the Company’s obligation to
pay Cintas a termination fee of $60 million if the merger agreement is terminated under certain specific
circumstances, is reasonable and consistent with fees in comparable transactions and not preclusive of other
competing proposals;

 

 
•  the fact that the Company and Cintas are required to use reasonable best efforts to obtain the required regulatory

approvals;
 

 
•  the commitment by Cintas to make certain divestitures of products, services and related assets representing up to $300

million in revenue, if necessary, to complete the Merger;
 

 
•  the requirement that Cintas pay to the Company a $100 million termination fee in the event (i) the merger agreement

is terminated by either Cintas or the Company following a court or government

order relating to the HSR Act or another antitrust law or regulation that enjoins or otherwise prohibits the completion
of the Merger or (ii) if the Merger is not completed by the End Date (as defined in the merger agreement), provided
all of the conditions to closing are satisfied or are then capable of being satisfied, other than the conditions relating to
regulatory approvals; and

 

 
•  the conditions to closing, which are customary in number and scope, and which, in the case of the condition related to

the accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties at closing, are generally subject to a “Material Adverse
Effect” qualification.

 

 
•  Transaction Structure. The Company Board considered that the structure of the transaction as a merger would result in

detailed public disclosure and that the completion of the Merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.

In the course of its deliberations, the Company Board also considered certain risks and other potentially negative factors
concerning the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including:
 

 
•  that, following the Merger, the Company will no longer exist as a standalone public company, but will be a wholly owned

subsidiary of Cintas;
 

 
•  that the Company’s shareholders will have no ongoing equity participation in the Company following the Merger and will

not participate in further value increases, if any;
 

 
•  the risks and costs to the Company related to the uncertainty of the completion of the Merger, including adverse impacts on

employees and customers;
 

 
•  the fact that the Merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, as a result of a failure to satisfy certain

conditions, including approval by the Company’s shareholders and receipt of all regulatory clearances, including under the
HSR Act and under the Competition Act (Canada);

 

 
•  the uncertainty about the long-term effect of the Merger on the Company’s employees, including potential job losses,

potential and existing customers and suppliers and other parties;
 

 •  that the merger agreement precludes the Company from actively soliciting competing proposals;
 

 
•  the merger agreement’s restrictions on the conduct of the Company’s business before completion of the Merger, generally

requiring the Company to operate only in the ordinary course subject to certain specific limitations;
 

 
•  the fact that the Company’s officers and employees may receive certain benefits that are different from, and in addition to,

those of the Company’s shareholders (see “ — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”
beginning on page 46);

 

 
•  the costs and potential business disruptions involved in connection with entering into and completing the Merger, including

in connection with any potential litigation;
 

 
•  the possibility that the Company may be required under the terms of the Merger Agreement to pay a $60 million termination

fee; and
 

 
•  that the receipt of cash by shareholders in exchange for their shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the Merger

will be a taxable transaction to the Company’s shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Company Board includes the material factors
considered by the Company Board but does not necessarily include all of the factors considered by the Company Board. In
view of the complexity and variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement and the
Merger, the Company Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the
specific factors considered in reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given
different weights to different factors.

Certain G&K Unaudited Prospective Financial Information

In connection with the Merger, G&K’s management prepared financial projections of revenue (i.e., total sales), EBITDA,
operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share for fiscal years 2016 through 2021 (the “G&K Projections”), all
of which were prepared by G&K’s management as of January 15, 2016 with the fiscal year ended July 2, 2016 being recalculated by
G&K’s management as of August 5, 2016 based on G&K’s fiscal year end results for the year ended July 2, 2016. The G&K
Projections were prepared for internal use and provided to the Company Board, for the purposes of considering, analyzing and
evaluating G&K’s strategic and financial alternatives, including the Merger. The G&K Projections were also provided to BofA Merrill
Lynch in connection with rendering its fairness opinion to the Company Board and in performing the related analyses. The G&K
Projections were not provided to Cintas or Cintas’ financial advisor prior to the signing of the merger agreement. G&K is including in
this proxy statement a summary of certain limited unaudited prospective financial information for G&K on a standalone basis, without
giving effect to the Merger, to give G&K shareholders access to certain nonpublic information provided to the Company Board and
BofA Merrill Lynch for purposes of evaluating the Merger. The inclusion of the G&K Projections should not be regarded as an
indication that the Company Board, G&K, BofA Merrill Lynch or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers,
it to be an assurance of the achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results of G&K, and they should not be
relied on as such.

The G&K Projections and the underlying assumptions upon which the G&K Projections were based are subjective in many
respects, and subject to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions attributable to the cyclicality of G&K’s industry and based on
actual experience and business developments. The G&K Projections reflect numerous assumptions with respect to G&K’s
performance, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of
which are difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties and beyond G&K’s control. Multiple
factors, including those described in the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,” could cause
the G&K Projections or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate. As a result, there can be no assurance that the G&K Projections
will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly different than projected. Because the G&K Projections cover multiple
years, such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. The G&K Projections do not take into account
any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared. Economic and business environments can and do
change quickly, which adds an additional significant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the G&K Projections
will be achieved. As a result, the inclusion of the G&K Projections in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or
representation by G&K or any other person that the information is material. The summary of the G&K Projections is not provided to
influence G&K shareholders’ decisions regarding whether to vote for the Merger proposal or any other proposal.

The G&K Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward compliance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither KPMG LLP (“KPMG”),
G&K’s independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other accounting firm, has examined, compiled or performed any
procedures with respect to the G&K Projections, and accordingly, KPMG does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance
with respect thereto. The KPMG report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to G&K’s historical financial
information. It does not extend to the prospective financial information contained herein and should not be read to do so.

(3) Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share exclude income allocable to participating securities at an assumed

allocation rate of 1.5% of net income from continued operations.
(4) Unlevered Free Cash Flow is defined as earnings before interest and taxes, less taxes, plus depreciation and amortization, less

capital expenditures, plus (less) changes in net working capital.

The G&K Projections do not take into account the possible financial and other effects on G&K of the Merger and do not attempt
to predict or suggest future results of the combined company. The G&K Projections do not give effect to the Merger, including the
impact of negotiating or executing the merger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with consummating the
Merger, the potential synergies that may be achieved by the combined company as a result of the Merger, the effect on G&K of any
business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed, or the
effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been
executed, but that were instead altered, accelerated, postponed or not taken in anticipation of the Merger. Further, the G&K Projections
do not take into account the effect on G&K of any possible failure of the Merger to occur.

For the foregoing reasons, and considering that the annual meeting will be held several months after the G&K Projections were
prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting information, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place
unwarranted reliance on the G&K Projections set forth above. No one has made or makes any representation to any shareholder
regarding the information included in the G&K Projections. G&K urges all G&K shareholders to review its most recent SEC filings for
a description of its reported financial results. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”

In addition, the G&K Projections have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date the G&K
Projections were prepared, and except as required by applicable securities laws, G&K does not intend to update or otherwise revise the
G&K Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the
occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The G&K Projections contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, which G&K
believes are more meaningful in understanding its past financial performance and future results. The non-GAAP financial measures are
not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with
G&K’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliation to GAAP measures presented
herein. G&K management regularly uses supplemental non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand and manage the
business and forecast future periods.

Opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch

G&K has retained BofA Merrill Lynch to act as G&K’s financial advisor in connection with the Merger. BofA Merrill Lynch is an
internationally recognized investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in
connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. G&K selected BofA Merrill Lynch to act as G&K’s financial advisor in
connection with the Merger on the basis of BofA Merrill Lynch’s experience in transactions similar to the Merger, its reputation in the
investment community and its familiarity with G&K and its business.

On August 15, 2016, at a meeting of the Company Board held to evaluate the Merger, BofA Merrill Lynch delivered to the
Company Board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated August 15, 2016, to the effect that, as of
the date of the opinion and based on and subject to various assumptions and limitations described in its opinion, the merger
consideration to be received by holders of G&K common stock (other than excluded shares) was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders.

The full text of BofA Merrill Lynch’s written opinion to the Company Board, which describes, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex B
to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The following summary of BofA Merrill Lynch’s
opinion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. BofA Merrill Lynch delivered its opinion to the
Company Board for the benefit and use of the Company Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for purposes of
its evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial point of view. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address any
other aspect of the Merger and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other
strategies or transactions that might be available to G&K or in which G&K might engage or as to the underlying business
decision of G&K to proceed with or effect the Merger. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address any other aspect of the
Merger and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder as to how to vote or act in connection with the proposed
Merger or any related matter.

Table of Contents

In connection with rendering its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch:
 

 (i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to G&K;
 

 
(ii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of

G&K furnished to or discussed with BofA Merrill Lynch by the management of G&K, including certain financial
forecasts relating to G&K prepared by the management of G&K, referred to herein as G&K Projections;

 

 
(iii) discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of G&K with members of senior

management of G&K;
 

 
(iv) reviewed the trading history for G&K common stock and a comparison of that trading history with the trading histories of

other companies BofA Merrill Lynch deemed relevant;
 

 
(v) compared certain financial and stock market information of G&K with similar information of other companies BofA

Merrill Lynch deemed relevant;
 

 
(vi) compared certain financial terms of the Merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions

BofA Merrill Lynch deemed relevant;
 

 (vii) reviewed a draft, dated August 14, 2016, of the merger agreement (the “Draft Agreement”); and
 

 
(viii) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as BofA Merrill Lynch

deemed appropriate.

In arriving at its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and
completeness of the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed
with BofA Merrill Lynch and relied upon the assurances of the management of G&K that they were not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the G&K
Projections, BofA Merrill Lynch was advised by G&K, and assumed, that the G&K Projections were reasonably prepared on bases
reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of G&K as to the future financial
performance of G&K. BofA Merrill Lynch did not make or was not provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets
or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of G&K, nor did it make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of G&K. BofA
Merrill Lynch did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of G&K or Cintas under any state, federal or other laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Merrill Lynch assumed, at the direction of G&K, that the Merger would be
consummated in accordance with its terms, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement
and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the
Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, would be
imposed that would have an adverse effect on G&K. BofA Merrill Lynch has also assumed, at the direction of G&K, that the final
executed merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement reviewed by BofA Merrill Lynch.

BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects of the Merger (other than the merger
consideration to the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger. BofA
Merrill Lynch was not requested to, and it did not, solicit indications of interest or proposals from third parties regarding a possible
acquisition of all or any part of G&K or any alternative transaction. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion was limited to the fairness, from a
financial point of view, of the holders of G&K common stock and no opinion or view was expressed with respect to any consideration
received in connection with the Merger by the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In
addition, no opinion or view was expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other
aspect of any compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative
to the merger consideration. Furthermore, no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to
other strategies or transactions that

might be available to G&K or in which G&K might engage or as to the underlying business decision of G&K to proceed with or effect
the Merger. In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no opinion or recommendation as to how any shareholder should vote or act in
connection with the Merger or any related matter. Except as described above, G&K imposed no other limitations on the investigations
made or procedures followed by BofA Merrill Lynch in rendering its opinion.

BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and
circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to BofA Merrill Lynch as of, the date of its opinion. It should be
understood that subsequent developments may affect its opinion, and BofA Merrill Lynch does not have any obligation to update,
revise or reaffirm its opinion. The issuance of BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion was approved by a fairness opinion review committee of
BofA Merrill Lynch.

The following represents a brief summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Merrill Lynch to the Company
Board in connection with its opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format
set forth below. In order to fully understand the financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill Lynch, the tables must be read
together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses
performed by BofA Merrill Lynch. Considering the data set forth in the tables below without considering the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by BofA Merrill Lynch. 

G&K Financial Analyses.

Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed publicly available financial and stock market
information for G&K and the following two selected publicly traded companies in the uniform rental and services industry:
 

 •  Cintas
 

 •  UniFirst Corporation

BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, among other things, per share equity values, based on closing stock prices on August 12, 2016, of the
selected publicly traded companies as a multiple of calendar year 2016 and 2017 estimated earnings per share, commonly referred to as
EPS, with such calendar adjusted to G&K’s fiscal year ending July 2, 2016 and July 1, 2017. The range of multiples for the selected
publicly traded companies was 21.1x - 26.1x for 2016 EPS and 20.5x - 24.0x for 2017 EPS. BofA Merrill Lynch then applied the
resulting 2016 EPS multiples of 21.0x to 26.0x derived from the selected publicly traded companies to G&K’s fiscal year 2016
estimated earnings per share, as adjusted in the G&K Projections by normalizing the projected figures for G&K’s fiscal year 2016 for a
52-week year (the “adjusted earnings per share”), and the resulting 2017 EPS multiples of 20.0x to 24.0x derived from the selected
publicly traded companies to G&K’s fiscal year 2017 adjusted earnings per share. Estimated financial data of the selected publicly
traded companies were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates, and estimated financial data of G&K were based on
the G&K Projections. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges (rounded to
the nearest $0.05) for G&K, as compared to the merger consideration:

Merger Consideration2016E EPS  2017E EPS  

$73.30 - $90.75  $75.65 - $90.80  $97.50

No selected company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to G&K. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of
this analysis is not entirely predictive. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the companies to which
G&K was compared.

BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed transaction values, either based on public filings or calculated as the enterprise value, calculated as
equity values based on the consideration payable to the shareholders in the selected transaction, plus debt, plus preferred equity and
minority interests, less cash, implied for the target company, as a multiple of the target company’s last twelve months (“LTM”)
estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, commonly referred to as EBITDA. Financial data of the
selected acquisition precedent transactions was based on publicly available information at the time of announcement of each relevant
transaction. For the transactions in which G&K was a party, the EBITDA multiples were provided by G&K management. Based on
such LTM EBITDA, the range of EBITDA multiples for the selected transactions was 7.3x - 12.2x and the mean and median EBITDA
multiples for the selected transactions were 9.6x and 9.3x, respectively. BofA Merrill Lynch then applied LTM EBITDA multiples of
7.5x - 12.0x derived from the selected acquisition precedent transactions to G&K’s EBITDA for fiscal year 2016, as disclosed in the
G&K Projections, which was normalized for a 52-week year, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for G&K. BofA Merrill
Lynch deducted from these ranges of implied enterprise values G&K’s estimate of the net debt of G&K as of July 2, 2016 of $207
million and divided the resulting ranges of implied equity values by a number of fully diluted shares, based on 19,681,478 common
shares and 716,521 stock options with an average strike price of $42.93 as of August 12, 2016 (calculated on a treasury stock method
basis taking into account outstanding in-the-money options and restricted stock, based on information provided by G&K), to derive the
following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges (rounded to the nearest $0.05) for G&K, as compared to the
merger consideration:

No selected company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to G&K or the
Merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely predictive. Rather, this analysis involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
acquisition or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions to which G&K and the Merger were compared.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of G&K to calculate the
estimated present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that G&K was forecasted to generate during G&K’s fiscal
year 2017 through fiscal year 2021 based on the G&K Projections. Unlevered, after-tax free cash flows were calculated as earnings
before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), less taxes, plus depreciation and amortization, less capital expenditures, plus (less) changes in net
working capital. BofA Merrill Lynch calculated a range of terminal values for G&K by applying an assumed perpetuity growth rate
range, based on guidance provided by G&K management, of 2.50% - 3.50% to G&K’s estimated terminal year unlevered, after-tax free
cash flow. The cash flows from fiscal year 2017 through fiscal year 2021 and the range of terminal values were then discounted using a
mid-year convention to present value as of June 30, 2016 using discount rates ranging from 8.00% - 10.00%, which were based on an
estimate of G&K’s weighted average cost of capital and chosen by BofA Merrill Lynch upon an analysis of the capital structure and
costs of equity and debt of the Company, to derive a range of implied enterprise values for G&K. BofA Merrill Lynch deducted from
these ranges of implied enterprise values G&K’s estimate of the net debt of G&K as of July 2, 2016 of $207 million and divided the
resulting ranges of implied equity values by a number of fully diluted shares, based on 19,681,478 common shares and 716,521 stock
options with an average strike price of $42.93 as of August 12, 2016 (calculated on a treasury stock method basis taking into account
outstanding in-the-money options and restricted stock, based on information provided by G&K), to derive the following approximate
implied per share equity value reference ranges (rounded to the nearest $0.05) for G&K as compared to the merger consideration:
 

Implied Per Share Equity Value Reference Range for G&K   Merger Consideration
$61.45 - $106.00   $97.50

Present Value of Projected Future Stock Price. BofA Merrill Lynch performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value
of the future price per share of G&K’s common stock, which is designed to provide insight into an illustrative potential future price of
G&K’s common equity as a function of (1) G&K’s future earnings and an assumed stock price to next fiscal year (“NFY”) earnings
multiple and (2) G&K’s future dividends to G&K’s common shareholders. BofA Merrill Lynch calculated the implied values per share
of G&K’s common stock in one year, two years, three years and four years from August 12, 2016 by first applying to G&K’s projected
earnings per share based on G&K Projections for each of the fiscal years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively, the following NFY
earnings per share multiples: (i) 20.8x, based on Wall Street estimates of G&K’s 2017 earnings per share and its common stock price as
of August 12, 2016; (ii) 19.0x, estimated by applying an approximately 8.6% discount to the NFY earnings per share multiple of 20.8x
described above (the 8.6% discount represents the percentage amount that the two year average stock price to next twelve months
(“NTM”) earnings per share multiple as of August 12, 2016, falls below the NTM earnings per share multiple of 20.5x, which is based
on Wall Street estimates of G&K’s NTM earnings per share and its common stock price as of August 12, 2016); and (iii) 17.2x,
estimated by applying an approximately 17.2% discount to the NFY earnings per share multiple of 20.8x described above (the 17.2%
discount represents the percentage amount that the five year average stock price to NTM earnings per share multiple as of August 12,
2016, falls below the NTM earnings per share multiple of 20.5x). BofA Merrill Lynch then discounted to August 12, 2016 the resulting
implied values per share of G&K’s common stock in one year, two years, three years and four years from August 12, 2016 by assuming
a cost of equity for G&K of 9.5%. BofA Merrill Lynch then added to the resulting implied present values per share, cumulative future
dividends per share of $1.60, $3.36, $5.42 and $7.80 respectively based on G&K Projections of future dividends per common share of
$1.60 in 2017, $1.75 in 2018, $2.06 in 2019, and $2.38 in 2020, discounted to August 12, 2016 using a mid-year convention. This
analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges (rounded to the nearest $0.05) for G&K,
as compared to the current fiscal 2017 price to earnings multiple and the per share merger consideration:

Other Factors.

In rendering its opinion, BofA Merrill Lynch also reviewed and considered other factors, including:
 

 •  historical trading prices of G&K common stock during the five-year period ended August 12, 2016;
 

 
•  the present value of targets for G&K’s common stock published by five equity analysts during the period from April 26,

2016 to June 6, 2016, and ranging from a low of $58.00 per share to a high of $83.00 per share, with a mean of $74.60 and a
median of $78.00 per share; and

 

 

•  the implied premiums of the merger consideration of $97.50 to G&K’s common stock price as of August 12, 2016 and its
historical stock prices, including the 20.4% premium to the stock price on August 12, 2016, the 22.7% premium to the 30-
trading day volume weighted average price through August 12, 2016, the 29.2% premium to the 90-trading day volume
weighted average price through August 12, 2016, the 40.3% premium to the one-year volume weighted average price
through August 12, 2016, the 43.7% premium to the two-year volume weighted average price through August 12, 2016, the
50.3% premium to the three-year volume weighted average price through August 12, 2016, the 20.1% premium to the 52-
week high for the period ending August 12, 2016, and the 68.7% premium to the 52-week low for the period ending August
12, 2016 as compared to the premiums paid to the unaffected stock price and 52-week high in U.S. all cash transactions
between $500 to $3,500 million from 2000 to 2016.

Miscellaneous

As noted above, the discussion set forth above is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by BofA Merrill Lynch
to the Company Board in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken by BofA
Merrill Lynch in connection with its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various
determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the
particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA
Merrill Lynch believes that its analyses summarized above must be considered as a whole. BofA Merrill Lynch further believes that
selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering
all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes
underlying BofA Merrill Lynch’s analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is
not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.

In performing its analyses, BofA Merrill Lynch considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and
other matters, many of which are beyond the control of G&K and Cintas. The estimates of the future performance of G&K and Cintas
in or underlying BofA Merrill Lynch’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than those such estimates or estimates suggested by BofA Merrill Lynch’s analyses. These analyses
were prepared solely as part of BofA Merrill Lynch’s analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger
consideration and were provided to the Company Board in connection with the delivery of BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion. The analyses
do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities
have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any
particular analysis described above are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Merrill Lynch’s
view of the actual value of G&K.

The type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger was determined through negotiations between G&K and Cintas,
rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Company Board. The decision to enter into the merger agreement was
solely that of the Company Board. As described above, BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion and analyses were only one of many factors
considered by the Company Board in its evaluation of the proposed Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of
the Company Board or management with respect to the Merger or the merger consideration.

G&K has agreed to pay BofA Merrill Lynch for its services in connection with the Merger an aggregate fee currently estimated to
be approximately $25 million, $1 million of which was payable in connection with its opinion and the remaining portion of which is
contingent upon the completion of the Merger. G&K also has agreed to reimburse BofA Merrill Lynch for its expenses incurred in
connection with BofA Merrill Lynch’s engagement and to indemnify BofA Merrill Lynch, any controlling person of BofA Merrill
Lynch and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities
under the federal securities laws.

BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities,
commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing
investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment management, financing and financial advisory services and other
commercial services and products to a wide range of companies, governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their
businesses, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates invest on a principal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that invest,
make or hold long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in the equity, debt or other securities or
financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of G&K, Cintas and certain of their respective affiliates.

BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide investment
banking, commercial banking and other financial services to G&K and have received or in the future may receive compensation for the
rendering of these services, including acting as joint bookrunner and co-lead arranger for, and as a lender (including a letter of credit
lender) to, G&K under its revolving credit facility and providing G&K certain treasury and trade management services and
products. From August 1, 2014 through July 31, 2016, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from G&K and
its affiliates of approximately $2 million for investment and corporate banking services.

Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

Members of our board of directors and our executive officers have various interests in the Merger described in this section that
may be in addition to, or different from, the interests of G&K Services, Inc. shareholders generally. You should keep this in mind when
considering the recommendation of the Company Board for the approval of the merger agreement. The members of the Company
Board were aware of these interests and considered them at the time they approved the merger agreement and in making their
recommendation that G&K Services, Inc. shareholders approve the merger agreement. These interests are described below.

Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards

The Company sponsors the G&K Services, Inc. Restated Equity Incentive Plan (2013) (the “Stock Plan”). Outstanding awards
under the Stock Plan include stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units. As further described under “The Merger
Agreement — Treatment of Company Equity Awards; Stock Purchase Program,” on page 59, under the merger agreement, for each
award granted to non-employee directors and executive officers under the Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger, the vesting will accelerate in full and all restrictions will lapse at which point such awards will be
cancelled and terminated in consideration for the right to receive a cash payment. For options, such cash payment will generally be
equal to the product of the number of shares subject to the award, and the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise
price of such option. For all other awards, such cash payment will generally be equal to the product of the number of shares subject to
the award, assuming target level of performance for any performance-based vesting awards, multiplied by the merger consideration.

Change of Control Severance Benefits for Executive Officers

Severance Policy

The Company maintains the G&K Services, Inc. Executive Severance and Change in Control Policy (the “Severance Policy”),
pursuant to which participants, including the Company’s executive officers (other than Mr. Milroy, whose arrangement is described
below), are entitled to the following payments and benefits upon such an officer’s (i) termination of employment by the Company
without “cause” (as defined in the Severance Policy) or (ii) resignation by the executive officer for “good reason” (as defined in the
Severance Policy), in either case within one year following a change of control:
 

 •  a lump sum severance payment equal to the sum of 17 months of the officer’s base salary;
 

 •  Company payment of the employer portion of monthly health insurance premiums up to 17 months; and
 

 
•  up to $12,000 in expenses for an outplacement organization selected by the officer that are incurred during the 1 year period

commencing as of the officer’s date of termination without cause or resignation for good reason.

The Merger will constitute a change of control for purposes of the Severance Policy.

Under the terms of the Severance Policy, the Company, if terminating the officer’s employment without cause, or the officer, if
resigning for good reason, must deliver 30 days’ advance written notice of such termination or resignation to the other party. During
such 30-day notice period, the Company shall continue to pay the officer his or her salary and other amounts due, and shall otherwise
continue any benefits that had been afforded the officer immediately prior to delivery of any such notice, but may, in its discretion,
relieve the officer of some or all of his or her title, duties and responsibilities.

In addition, the Severance Policy provides that upon the occurrence of a change of control, generally any equity-based incentive
awards that are held by the officer on the date of such change of control will become fully vested.

All payments and benefits made under the Severance Policy are subject to the officer executing a general release of claims and
remaining in compliance at all times with any duties or obligations the officer may have under any agreement with the Company with
respect to the officer complying with restrictive covenants.

If payments under the Severance Policy, together with any other payment or benefit received in connection with a change of
control of the Company, would result in an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, then such payments and
benefits will be reduced to the extent necessary to eliminate such excise tax, but only if and to the extent that such reduction would
result in an increase in the aggregate payments and benefits to be provided to the officer, as determined on an after-tax basis.

Employment Agreement with Mr. Milroy

Mr. Milroy is a party to an employment agreement with the Company, effective March 1, 2007, and last amended on August 23,
2012 (“Mr. Milroy’s Agreement”), that provides Mr. Milroy with similar benefits and payments as provided to other named executive
officers (“NEOs”) under the Severance Policy. Under the terms of Mr. Milroy’s Agreement, Mr. Milroy is entitled to the following
payments and benefits in the event of Mr. Milroy’s (i) termination of employment by the Company without “cause” (as defined in Mr.
Milroy’s Agreement) or (ii) resignation by Mr. Milroy for “good reason” (as defined in Mr. Milroy’s Agreement), in either case within
one year following a change of control:
 

 
•  a severance payment equal to 1.99 times Mr. Milroy’s base salary in effect as of his date of termination or resignation,

payable in weekly installments over 17 months but subject to a six month delayed commencement to the extent required by
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code;

 

 •  Company payment of the employer portion of monthly health insurance premiums up to 17 months;

Table of Contents

 
•  up to $12,000 in expenses for outplacement services incurred during the 1 year period commencing as of Mr. Milroy’s date

of termination or resignation;
 

 
•  a lump sum amount necessary to acquire full title to any personal automobile leased by us for Mr. Milroy or, if Mr. Milroy

does not have the use of a personal automobile but has been given an automobile allowance, a lump sum payment equal to 3
times Mr. Milroy’s annual automobile allowance, payable on the 6 month anniversary of his termination date;

 

 
•  up to $7,500 in financial planning and tax preparation expenses incurred during the 17-month period commencing on Mr.

Milroy’s date of termination or resignation; and
 

 
•  payment of any unpaid management incentive bonus that Mr. Milroy earned a right to receive as of the last day of the fiscal

year ending prior to his termination.

Mr. Milroy’s Agreement also generally provides that, upon a change of control his economic incentive awards granted under the
Stock Plan will become fully-vested. The Merger will constitute a change of control for purposes of Mr. Milroy’s Agreement.

All payments and benefits made under Mr. Milroy’s Agreement are subject to Mr. Milroy executing a general release of claims
and his complying with restrictive covenants for 18 months following his termination or resignation date and a confidentiality covenant
in perpetuity.

If payments and benefits under Mr. Milroy’s Agreement made in connection with a change of control would result in an excise
tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, then such payments and benefits will be reduced to the minimum extent
necessary to provide Mr. Milroy with the best after-tax result.

Annual Executive Management Incentive Plan

Our Annual Executive Management Incentive Plan (the “MIP”) is a variable pay program tied to achievement of annual business
goals. Under the terms of the MIP, incentive plan awards for our executive officers will be made as a Performance Unit awards under
the Company’s Restated Equity Incentive Plan (2013) to be paid in cash and limited to $5 million per NEO as required under the terms
of that plan. The payout for each qualified performance-based measure of an NEO’s MIP calculation is determined by multiplying the
NEO’s base salary, the NEO’s target incentive percentage, and certain financial measures based generally on achievement of certain
targets against an internal business plan approved annually by our board of directors. The Company may cause the annual MIP
incentive plan awards for the fiscal year in which the effective time occurs to be paid out on a pro-rated basis based on performance
measured through the effective time. The Company may pay such prorated incentives to an executive officer without requiring that the
executive officer remain employed through the payment date, provided that the payment is pro-rated to reflect the portion of the
performance period during which the executive officer remained employed. For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits
described above that could become payable, please see the column titled MIP and the described assumptions at “— Information
Regarding Golden Parachute Compensation.”

Deferred Compensation Plan

The Company sponsors the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (“DEFCO”), which will be terminated and all amounts
distributed in connection with the consummation of the Merger. All executive officers (other than Mr. Fancey) participate in the
DEFCO and will become fully vested and paid their respective account balance upon the termination of the DEFCO. For an estimate of
the value of the payments and benefits described above that could become payable, please see the column titled Pension/NQDC and the
described assumptions at “— Information Regarding Golden Parachute Compensation.”

Retention Program

Pursuant to the Merger, the Company has approved a retention program in the aggregate amount of not more than $7.5 million to
promote retention and to incentivize efforts to consummate the closing of the Merger with eligible employees selected at the discretion
of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. The Company has entered into a retention bonus agreement with Mr. Cotter. Payment of
Mr. Cotter’s retention award will be paid in a cash lump sum at the end of the retention period, subject to continued employment
through the retention period (unless earlier terminated without cause). The retention period will end on the earlier of the transaction
closing date or August 15, 2017. It is expected that no other executive officers will participate in the retention program. For an estimate
of the value of the payments and benefits described above that could become payable, please see the column titled Retention Program
and the described assumptions at “—Information Regarding Golden Parachute Compensation.”

Information Regarding Golden Parachute Compensation

In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the tables below present the estimated amounts of compensation that each
named executive officer could receive that are based on or otherwise relate to the Merger. This compensation is referred to as “golden
parachute” compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section we use such term to describe the Merger-related
compensation payable to G&K Services, Inc.’s named executive officers. This Merger-related compensation is subject to a non-binding
advisory vote of G&K Services, Inc.’s shareholders. See the section entitled “The Annual Meeting — Required Vote —Advisory (Non-
Binding) Vote on Merger-Related Compensation,” beginning on page 23.

The amounts set forth below have been calculated assuming the Merger was consummated on December 31, 2016, the latest
practicable date determined prior to the filing of this proxy statement as of which we could estimate these payments, and, where
applicable, assuming each named executive officer was terminated by the Company without cause or by the officer for good reason
(each, a “qualifying termination”) on such date. The amounts indicated in the table below are estimates of amounts that would be
payable to the named executive officers, and the estimates are based on multiple assumptions before taxes that may or may not actually
occur, including assumptions described in this proxy statement and in the footnotes to the table. Some of the assumptions are based on
information not currently available, and as a result, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may differ in
material respects from the amounts set forth below. All dollar amounts set forth below have been rounded to the nearest whole number.

Indemnification and Insurance

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Cintas has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of
expenses to, the present and former officers and directors of G&K and its subsidiaries (when acting in such capacity) against any costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities that are incurred in
connection with any civil, criminal, administrative or other similar proceeding, litigation, audit, investigation, arbitration, action, suit,
review, examination, inquiry, hearing, demand, claim or similar action, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
effective time of the Merger (including in connection with the approval of the merger agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby or arising out of or pertaining to such transactions) to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
authorized to indemnify such indemnified persons under its articles of incorporation or bylaws in effect on August 15, 2016 agreement.
Cintas has also agreed that it or the surviving company will advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent authorized under
applicable law; provided, that the indemnified person to whom expenses are advanced provides the undertaking required by applicable
law to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such indemnified person is not entitled to indemnification.

Cintas has also agreed to include provisions for indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the indemnified
persons in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving company and maintain such provisions to the fullest extend
authorized under law on the same basis as set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company in effect on the date
of the merger agreement for a period of at least six years following the effective time of the Merger.

Prior to the effective time of the Merger, the Company has agreed to obtain insurance policies for the extension of the directors’
and officers’ liability coverage of the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies (“D&O Insurance”) for a claims
period of at least six years from and after the effective time, provided that the cost thereof does not exceed an amount equal to 300% of
the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the Company and the surviving corporation for any reason
fail to obtain such insurance policies as of the effective time, the surviving corporation will continue to maintain in effect for a period
of at least six years from and after the effective time the D&O Insurance in place as of August 15, 2016 or purchase comparable D&O
Insurance for such six-year period. However, in no event will Cintas or the surviving corporation be required to expend for such
policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

On September 26, 2016, a putative shareholder class action lawsuit, captioned Klein v. G&K Services, Incorporated, et al., Civil
Action No. 16-cv-03198 (RHK) (KMM), was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, against the
Company and the members of the Company Board. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and alleges, among other things, that the Company’s preliminary proxy statement contains false and misleading
statements and/or omits material information. The complaint seeks, among other things, injunctive relief and an award of attorneys’
fees and expenses. The parties believe the claims asserted in the lawsuit are without merit.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders (as
defined below) of common stock whose shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion does not address U.S.
federal income tax consequences with respect to holders other than U.S. holders. This discussion is based on the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, judicial opinions and administrative
rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), each as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities
are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change or interpretation could affect the
accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion is for general information purposes only and
does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences. This discussion does not address any tax consequences
arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010,
nor does it address any tax considerations under state, local or foreign laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S.
federal income tax. This discussion is not binding on the IRS or the courts and, therefore, could be subject to challenge, which could be
sustained. No ruling is intended to be sought from the IRS with respect to the Merger.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of common stock that is for U.S. federal income
tax purposes:
 

 •  a citizen or individual resident of the United States;
 

 
•  a corporation, or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or

under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;
 

 
•  a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration, and one

or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) such trust has a valid election in
effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or

 

 •  an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.

This discussion applies only to U.S. holders of shares of common stock who hold such shares as a capital asset within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not
purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in light of its particular
circumstances, or that may apply to U.S. holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for
example, insurance companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies, traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market
method of accounting, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, U.S. holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S.
dollar, tax-exempt organizations, tax-qualified retirement plans, banks and other financial institutions, mutual funds, certain expatriates,
partnerships (or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes), S corporations, or other
pass-through entities, or investors in such partnerships, S corporations or other pass-through entities, real estate investment trusts,
regulated

Table of Contents

investment companies, U.S. holders who hold shares of common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or
other integrated transaction, U.S. holders who will hold (actually or constructively) an equity interest in the surviving corporation
immediately after the Merger, and U.S. holders who acquired their shares of common stock through the exercise of employee stock
options or other compensation arrangements). This discussion also does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to
holders of shares of common stock who exercise dissenters’ rights in connection with the Merger under the MBCA.

If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) holds shares of common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the
partners and the activities of the partnership. If you are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a partner in a partnership holding shares
of common stock, you should consult your tax advisor.

This summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is not tax
advice. Holders of common stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to
them of the Merger, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax, the unearned income Medicare
contribution tax and any other U.S. federal, or state, local, foreign or other tax laws.

The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder who receives cash in exchange for
shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between
(1) the amount of cash received and (2) the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
shares of common stock generally will equal the holder’s purchase price for such shares, as adjusted to take into account stock
dividends, stock splits, or similar transactions.

Any such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. holder’s holding period in the shares of common stock
surrendered in the Merger is greater than one year as of the date of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate
holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses
is subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of common stock at different times and different prices, such U.S.
holder must determine its adjusted tax basis, gain or loss and holding period separately with respect to each block of common stock.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Payments made in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject, under certain circumstances, to
information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%). To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. holder that does not
otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return to the applicable withholding agent a properly completed and executed
IRS Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. holder is a U.S. person, that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct, and that
such U.S. holder is not subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or
credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the
IRS in a timely manner.

Financing

In connection with execution of the merger agreement, Cintas expects to fund the merger consideration in part with new debt
incurred under a debt financing commitment letter previously provided to the Company. In this respect, Cintas has received debt
financing commitments in the amount of $2.3 billion. Cintas has agreed to

Table of Contents

use reasonable best efforts to obtain the debt financing contemplated by such debt financing commitment letter. There is, however, no
financing condition to Cintas’ obligation to consummate the Merger. See the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Financing and
Financing Cooperation.”

Regulatory Approvals

Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed until notifications have
been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division and the FTC, and all statutory waiting period requirements have been
satisfied. Similarly, under the Competition Act (Canada), transactions above certain financial thresholds, including the Merger, may not
be completed until notice has been given to and prescribed information filed with the Competition Commissioner and all statutory
waiting period requirements have been satisfied.

Completion of the Merger is subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and
Competition Act Approval. On August 29, 2016, Cintas filed its Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the
FTC. On August 30, 2016, the Company filed its Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC. On
September 12, 2016, both the Company and Cintas filed their respective pre-merger notification forms with the Competition
Commissioner, and Cintas also filed a request for an advance ruling certificate or no-action letter.

On September 29, 2016, each of the Company and Cintas received a request for additional information and documentary material,
commonly referred to as a “second request,” from the FTC, pursuant to the HSR Act, in connection with the Merger. A “second
request” is a routine part of the FTC’s review of proposed transactions. The FTC’s “second request” has the effect of extending the
waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Merger until the 30th day after substantial compliance by the Company and
Cintas with the “second request,” unless the waiting period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the FTC.

At any time before or after the completion of the Merger, the Antitrust Division or the FTC may take action under the antitrust
laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, to rescind the Merger or to conditionally permit completion of the
Merger subject to regulatory conditions or other remedies. In addition, non-U.S. regulatory bodies, such as the Competition
Commissioner under the Competition Act (Canada), or U.S. state attorneys general under the antitrust laws could take action as they
deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or
permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under
some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a
challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

The Company and Cintas have each agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain and maintain all regulatory approvals
necessary to complete the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. If necessary to obtain the requisite
antitrust clearances, the Company and Cintas have agreed, among other things, (i) to propose, negotiate, commit to, effect and agree to,
by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, holding separate, and other disposition of the
businesses, assets, properties, products, product lines, and equity interests of Cintas, the Company, and their respective subsidiaries and
take such action or actions that would in the aggregate have a similar effect, (ii) create, terminate, or divest relationships, ventures,
contractual rights or obligations of Cintas, the Company or their respective subsidiaries, and (iii) otherwise take or commit to take any
action that would limit Cintas’ freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses,
assets, equity interests, products, product lines or properties of the Cintas or the Company (including any of their respective
subsidiaries). However, the Company and Cintas will not be required to take, or cause to be taken, or commit to take, or commit to
cause to be taken, any divestiture, license, hold separate, sale or other disposition (1) with respect to, any of the products, product lines,
services or service lines, in each case in whole or in part, of the Company, Cintas or any of their

respective subsidiaries representing, in the aggregate, in excess of $300 million of net sales or (2) of, or with respect to, Cintas’
“CINTAS” trademark or trade name. See the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement — Efforts to Consummate the Merger” and
“— Divestitures and Triggering Divestiture.”

For purposes of the regulatory approvals provisions in the merger agreement, the calculation of “net sales”
means net sales with respect to any product, product line, service or service line, in each case, in whole or in part, measured by
reference to the net sales associated with such product, product line, service or service line for the fiscal year ended July 2, 2016, in the
case of products, product lines, services or service lines of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or May 31, 2016 in the case of
Cintas or any of its subsidiaries. However, any related assets, businesses, properties, or equity interests shall not be included in the
calculation of net sales.

Delisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock

If the Merger is completed, the Company common stock will be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market and
deregistered under the Exchange Act.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex A and which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. This summary does not purport to be complete
and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully the
merger agreement in its entirety, as the rights and obligations of the parties thereto are governed by the express terms of the merger
agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

The following summary of the merger agreement, and the copy of the merger agreement attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement, are intended to provide information regarding the terms of the merger agreement and are not intended to provide any factual
information about G&K or modify or supplement any factual disclosures about G&K in its public reports filed with the SEC. In
particular, the merger agreement and the related summary are not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures
regarding any facts and circumstances relating to G&K. The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by and
covenants of G&K, Cintas and Merger Sub which were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of specified dates. The
representations, warranties and covenants in the merger agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger
agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures
made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the merger agreement instead of establishing these matters as
facts, and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality or material adverse effect applicable to the contracting parties that
generally differ from those applicable to investors. In addition, information concerning the subject matter of the representations,
warranties and covenants may change after the date of the merger agreement (August 15, 2016), which subsequent information may or
may not be fully reflected in G&K’s public disclosures. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and
should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of
facts or condition of the parties thereto or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, the description of the merger
agreement below does not purport to describe all of the terms of the merger agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Annex A and is incorporated herein by reference.

Additional information about G&K may be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and G&K’s other public filings. See the
section entitled “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”

Structure of the Merger; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers

At the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with and into G&K, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease.
G&K will be the surviving corporation in the Merger, will continue its corporate existence as a Minnesota corporation as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Cintas. The articles of incorporation of G&K as in effect immediately before the effective time will be amended in
their entirety to the form of articles of incorporation of Merger Sub. The bylaws of G&K as in effect immediately before the effective
time will be the bylaws of the surviving corporation.

The individuals holding positions as directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately before the effective time will become the
initial directors and officers of the surviving corporation.

When the Merger Becomes Effective

The closing of the Merger will take place at 10:00 a.m. local time at the offices of Jones Day, 901 Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland,
Ohio 44114, on the third business day following the day on which the last of the conditions

set forth in the merger agreement to be satisfied or (to the extent permitted by law) waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) shall be satisfied or
waived in accordance with the merger agreement, or at such other place, date and time as G&K and Cintas may agree upon in writing.

On the closing date, G&K and Merger Sub will file articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota. The
Merger will become effective at such time as the articles of merger are filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota, or at
such later time as is specified in the articles of merger.

As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to consummate the Merger not later than the second quarter of calendar year
2017. However, completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the Merger,
which are described below and include various regulatory clearances and approvals. It is possible that factors outside the control of
G&K or Cintas could delay the completion of the Merger, or prevent it from being completed at all. There may be a substantial amount
of time between the annual meeting and the completion of the Merger.

Effect of the Merger on G&K Common Stock

At the effective time, each share of G&K common stock outstanding immediately before the effective time (other than shares
owned by G&K, Cintas or Merger Sub or any of their subsidiaries, which will be cancelled, and other than dissenting shares) will be
converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. The merger consideration will be $97.50 per share in cash, without
interest, and subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

At the effective time, each of the following categories of shares of G&K common stock will be cancelled and cease to exist, and
no consideration will be paid in exchange for such cancellation: (1) each share that is owned or held in treasury by G&K or any of its
direct or indirect subsidiaries, (2) any shares owned by Cintas, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect subsidiary of Cintas, and (3)
shares owned by shareholders who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights (which we refer to as “dissenting
shareholders” in this proxy statement) pursuant to Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA, subject to the right of any
dissenting shareholder to receive payment as described below in the section entitled “— Dissenters’ Rights.”

At the effective time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the effective time will be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the surviving corporation, and such shares will constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the surviving corporation.

Dissenters’ Rights

Each share of G&K common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and held by a dissenting shareholder shall
be cancelled and cease to exist and no merger consideration shall be paid to any dissenting shareholder in consideration for such
cancellation, but the dissenting shareholder will be entitled to the rights granted under Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA,
unless the dissenting shareholder fails to perfect, withdraws, or otherwise loses such rights. If a dissenting shareholder fails to perfect,
withdraws, or loses the right to appraisal granted under the MBCA, each share of G&K common stock held by such dissenting
shareholder shall be deemed to automatically be converted into, and to have become exchanged for, the per share merger consideration
as of the effective time. Pursuant to the merger agreement, G&K has agreed to provide Cintas with prompt notice (and in any event
within two business days) of any demands received by G&K in respect of dissenters’ rights, and Cintas has the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. G&K has agreed not to voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands without the prior written consent of Cintas.

rights with respect thereto, except the right to be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product of (x) the total number
of shares previously subject to such company option and (y) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price per
share of such company option, less any required withholding taxes. Each company option that is granted after December 31, 2016 to a
person other than Douglas A. Milroy or any employee covered by the company’s Executive Severance and Change in Control Policy
that provides for pro-rata vesting upon the effective time will vest pro-rata in accordance with its terms (and not in accordance with
clause (i) above), will result in the unvested portion being forfeited upon the effective time, and will result in the payment described in
clause (iii) above being made only with respect to the vested portion of such company option. Any company option with an exercise
price equal to, or in excess of, the per share merger consideration will be cancelled at the effective time for no consideration.

Restricted Stock. Except as provided below, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, each
award of restricted stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and not or no longer subject to performance based
vesting conditions will become vested and no longer subject to restrictions immediately prior to the effective time, and each award of
restricted stock subject to performance-based vesting conditions that have not been satisfied, if any, will become vested as of
immediately prior to the effective time, with respect to the number of shares of restricted stock determined as if the applicable
performance goals had been achieved at the target level of performance at the end of the applicable performance period. Such vested
and unrestricted shares shall be treated in the same manner as company shares generally in the merger, except that the merger
consideration paid to the holder shall be reduced by any required withholding taxes. Each award of restricted stock that is granted after
December 31, 2016 to a person other than Douglas A. Milroy or any employee covered by the company’s Executive Severance and
Change in Control Policy that provides for pro-rata vesting upon the effective time will vest pro-rata in accordance with its terms
(instead of vesting as provided above) and will result in the unvested portion being forfeited as of the effective time for no
consideration. Promptly following the effective time, any cash dividends previously paid by the Company with respect to restricted
stock and held as of the effective time by the Company or its designated agent shall be distributed by the Company to the holder of
such restricted stock, to the extent such restricted stock has become vested as described above.

Other Awards. Except as provided below, each award of a right under any stock plan (other than awards of company options or
restricted stock, the treatment of which is specified above) entitling the holder thereof to shares or cash equal to or based on the value
of shares (a “share unit”) that is outstanding or payable as of the effective time shall be cancelled and terminated as of the effective
time and each share unit holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to be paid an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares underlying such share units (or, if subject to performance-based
vesting, the number of shares at the target level of performance) and (ii) the per share merger consideration, less any required
withholding taxes. Each share unit that is granted after December 31, 2016 to a person other than Douglas A. Milroy or any employee
covered by the company’s Executive Severance and Change in Control Policy that provides for pro-rata vesting upon the effective time
will be treated as described in the foregoing except that the cash payment amount to be paid to each such holder will be calculated
based on the number of shares underlying the pro-rata vested share units (instead of the total number of shares as provided in clause (i)
above) and will result in the unvested portion of the share units being forfeited for no consideration. If any payment contemplated by
this paragraph would cause additional taxes to be payable by reason of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, then payment in
respect of such award will instead be made under the terms of the applicable stock plan and related award or other governing
documents at the earliest time permitted that will not result in additional taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue
Code.

Company Employee Stock Purchase Program. G&K will cause the final offering period under its Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(ESPP) to be terminated at least thirty days prior to the effective time, at which point participant accounts will be applied to the
purchase of common stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Effective immediately prior to the effective time, G&K’s ESPP
will be terminated and all amounts withheld by G&K on behalf of participants and not applied to the purchase of common stock will be
returned without interest to the participants.

Payment for Common Stock in the Merger

Prior to the effective time, Cintas will make available or will cause to be made available to a paying agent approved by G&K
amounts in immediately available cash sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration. As promptly as practicable (and no later
than the third business day) after the effective time, Cintas will cause the paying agent to mail to each person that was, immediately
prior to the effective time, a holder of record of shares of G&K common stock (other than holders of excluded shares) represented by
certificates: (i) a letter of transmittal and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
of the certificates as provided in the merger agreement) in exchange for the merger consideration. Upon surrender of a certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the certificate as provided in the merger agreement) to the paying agent in accordance with the terms of such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the paying agent, the holder of such
certificate will be entitled to receive the merger consideration (less any amount that may be withheld with respect to any applicable
withholding taxes).

No holder of shares of G&K common stock held in book-entry form will be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter
of transmittal to the paying agent to receive the merger consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the merger
agreement. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more shares of G&K common stock held in book-entry form (other than
excluded shares) whose shares were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration pursuant to the merger agreement will
automatically upon the effective time be entitled to receive, and Cintas will cause the exchange agent to pay and deliver as promptly as
practicable after the effective time (and in any event within five business days thereafter), in respect of each such share the merger
consideration, and such shares of G&K common stock held in book-entry form of such holder will then be canceled.

Representations and Warranties

The merger agreement contains representations and warranties of G&K, subject to certain exceptions in the merger agreement, in
the disclosure letter delivered by the Company in connection with the merger agreement (the “company disclosure letter”) and in
G&K’s public filings, as to, among other things:

Some of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by materiality qualifications or a “material
adverse effect” qualification with respect to either G&K or Cintas, as discussed below.

For purposes of the merger agreement, a “material adverse effect” with respect to G&K means any event, change, circumstance or
effect, each referred to as an “effect,” that, individually or in the aggregate together with all other effects, (1) prevents, materially
delays, materially impairs, or has a material adverse effect on the ability of G&K to perform its obligations under the merger agreement
or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or (2) is materially adverse to the
assets, cash flow, properties, operations, business, financial condition and/or results of operations of G&K and its subsidiaries taken as
a whole. However, a material adverse effect as described in the foregoing clause (2) is not deemed to include the impact of:
 

 
•  any effect generally affecting the economy or financial markets in the United States or elsewhere in the world (including

changes in interest rates) or that are the result of armed hostilities, acts of war or terrorism;
 

 •  any effect that is the result of factors generally affecting the principal industry in which G&K and its subsidiaries operate;
 

 
•  any effect resulting from changes or developments in GAAP, the rules and policies of the Public Company Accounting

Oversight Board or changes in applicable laws or interpretations of the foregoing;
 

 
•  any decline in the market price or trading volume of shares of G&K common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market,

but not the underlying causes thereof;
 

 
•  any effect resulting from (1) the failure to meet internal or external projections, budgets, guidance, forecasts or estimates of

revenues, earnings or other performance metrics or (2) any change in any analysts’ recommendations with respect to G&K
or its subsidiaries, but not, in any case, the underlying causes thereof;

 

 

•  any effect resulting from the entry into the merger agreement or the public announcement or pendency of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement (including (1) the impact thereof on the relationships, contractual or otherwise, of
G&K or any of its subsidiaries with employees, customers, suppliers, distributors, landlords, business partners or regulators,
but in each case solely to the extent resulting from such entry, public announcement or pendency, and (2) by reason of the
identity or, or facts and circumstances relating to, Cintas, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates);

 

 •  any effect relating to fluctuations in the value of any currency;
 

 •  any effect resulting from weather-related events, natural disasters, or national, international or regional calamities; and
 

 
•  any effect resulting from actions taken by G&K or its subsidiaries required by the merger agreement or taken with the

written consent, or at the written request, of Cintas or Merger Sub;

however, with respect to the matters described in the foregoing first, second, third, seventh, and eighth bullet points above, such
impact will be taken into account to the extent that it is disproportionately adverse to G&K and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
relative to other participants in the industries in which G&K and its subsidiaries operate.

Conduct of Business Pending the Merger

The merger agreement provides that, during the period from August 15, 2016 until the effective time or the earlier termination of
the merger agreement and, except as required by applicable law, with Cintas’ prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), as required by the merger agreement or as set forth in the company disclosure letter to the merger
agreement, G&K will, and will cause each of its

with respect to fiscal year 2017 and $0.41 per quarter for dividends with respect to fiscal year 2018;

Acquisition Proposals; No Solicitation

Except as permitted by the merger agreement, G&K has agreed that none of G&K, its subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
officers and directors may, and G&K will direct its and its subsidiaries’ representatives not to, directly or indirectly:
 

 
•  initiate, solicit, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that

constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any acquisition proposal (as defined below);
 

 
•  engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public

information to any third party relating to, any acquisition proposal, except to notify such third party of the non-solicitation
restrictions of the merger agreement;

 

 
•  enter into any letter of intent or similar document, or any agreement or commitment, providing for any acquisition proposal;

or
 

 

•  grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or confidentiality agreement in connection with an acquisition
proposal; except that, that if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
it would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary obligations under applicable law not to do so, G&K may waive any
standstill or similar provisions in any agreement to which it is a party to the extent necessary to permit a person to make, on
a confidential basis to the Company Board, an acquisition proposal.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, an “acquisition proposal” means any proposal or offer to engage in one or a series of related
transactions involving the direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition (including by merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange
offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination, joint venture, partnership or similar transaction involving
G&K or any of its subsidiaries) by any person, which if consummated would result in any person becoming the direct or indirect
beneficial owner of (1) 15% or more of the total voting power or economic interest in any class of equity securities of G&K or any of
its material subsidiaries or (2) 15% or more of the consolidated total assets, measured by fair market value as of the date of such
purchase or other acquisition of G&K and its subsidiaries taken as a whole. The definition of “acquisition proposal” excludes proposals
by Cintas, Merger Sub or their affiliates and the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Receipt of Acquisition Proposal

Notwithstanding the provisions of the merger agreement described above, if G&K receives a written acquisition proposal from a
third party prior to the time the requisite company vote is obtained that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation restrictions
of the merger agreement and which (i) the Company Board determines in good faith to be bona fide and (ii) the Company Board
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to take such action, in light of the acquisition proposal
and the terms of the merger agreement, would be inconsistent with the Company’s directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, the
Company may:
 

 
•  if the Company Board has determined in good faith based on the information then available and after consultation with the

Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors that such acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal
or is reasonably likely to result in a superior proposal:

 

 

•  provide information to the person who made such acquisition proposal, but only if the Company receives from the
person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less restrictive to such
other party than those contained in the confidentiality agreement (excluding any standstill provision) with Cintas and,
to the extent such information has not been previously made available to Cintas, promptly makes available to Cintas
any information the Company discloses to such person or its representatives; and

 

 •  engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such person and its representatives; and
 

 

•  if the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial
advisors that such acquisition proposal is a superior proposal, and so long as the Company has complied with certain
obligations set forth in the merger agreement, which are described below in the section below entitled “— Change in Board
Recommendation,” approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve, recommend or declare
advisable (publicly or otherwise) such acquisition proposal.

Pursuant to the merger agreement, a “superior proposal” means an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal that would
result in any person (other than Cintas or its affiliates) becoming the direct or indirect beneficial owner of all or substantially all of the
assets (on a consolidated basis) or all or substantially all of the total voting power of the equity securities of G&K that the Company
Board has determined in its good faith judgment (1) is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into
account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal, and (2) if consummated, would
result in a transaction more favorable to G&K’s shareholders than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement (after taking into account any revisions to the terms of the transactions resulting from discussions with Cintas following an
intervening event (as described more fully in the section entitled “— Change in Board Recommendation”) and the time likely to be
required to consummate such acquisition proposal).

G&K has agreed that, if (1) G&K receives a proposal or offer with respect to an acquisition proposal, (2) any non-public
information is requested from G&K with respect to an acquisition proposal, or (3) any person seeks to initiate discussions or
negotiations with G&K with respect to an acquisition proposal; then, in each case, G&K will promptly (and, in any event, within 48
hours) notify Cintas of such occurrence and disclose to Cintas the identity of the person making the proposal or offer and the material
terms of such proposal or offer (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed
contracts) and thereafter will keep Cintas promptly informed of the status of any such discussions or negotiations. In the event that any
party modifies the financial or other material terms of its acquisition proposal, G&K is required to notify Cintas orally and in writing
within 48 hours of receipt of such modification of the existence and terms of such modification (including, if applicable, copies of any
written documentation reflecting such modification). G&K and its subsidiaries are prohibited from entering into any confidentiality or
similar agreement subsequent to

August 15, 2016 that prohibits G&K from providing Cintas such material terms and conditions. G&K will promptly (and in any event
within 48 hours thereafter) notify Cintas of the identity of any person with which G&K enters into such a confidentiality or similar
agreement.

Change in Board Recommendation

The Company Board has recommended that G&K shareholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger agreement
(which we refer to as the “Company recommendation”). Except as expressly permitted by the merger agreement, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof, may directly or indirectly:
 

 
•  change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or announce its intention to change, qualify, withhold,

withdraw or modify, in each case in any manner adverse to Cintas, the Company recommendation;
 

 
•  approve or recommend to the G&K shareholders, or publicly propose or announce its intention to approve or recommend to

the G&K shareholders, an acquisition proposal;
 

 

•  following the public announcement of an acquisition proposal, fail to publicly reaffirm the Company recommendation within
ten business days (or prior to the G&K shareholders’ meeting if it will occur within such ten business day period) after
Cintas so requests in writing; provided, that such reaffirmation may indicate that G&K continues to evaluate the acquisition
proposal in a manner consistent with the merger agreement and that Cintas may only make one reaffirmation request with
respect to each acquisition proposal and one reaffirmation request with respect to each material amendment or modification
to an acquisition proposal; or

 

 

•  authorize, cause or permit G&K or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement or other similar agreement with respect to, or that is
intended or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any acquisition proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement entered
into in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement).

The merger agreement permits the Company Board to make a change of recommendation only in certain limited circumstances,
as described below (the actions described in the first, second, third bullet points above are referred to in this proxy statement as a
“change of recommendation”).

However, at any time after August 15, 2016 and prior to the time the requisite company vote is obtained, the Company Board may
make a change of recommendation in response to an intervening event if prior to taking such action, (i) the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, (ii) G&K has delivered to Cintas a written notice stating that the Company Board intends to take
such action no less than four business days prior to making such change of recommendation and has provided Cintas a description of
the intervening event, and (iii) at the end of such notice period, the Company Board has considered in good faith any revisions to the
terms of the merger agreement proposed in writing by Cintas, if any, and has determined, after consultation with the Company’s
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to make a change of recommendation would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Under the merger agreement, an “intervening event” means any event, development or change in circumstance that arises or
occurs after August 15, 2016 and is material to G&K and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, which as of such date was neither known to
nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board, and does not relate to or arise out of (1) any acquisition proposal or the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement; (2) changes in the price or trading volume of G&K’s common stock (but not the underlying
cause of such changes); (3) certain notices, consents, or filings designated by the merger agreement as “company approvals” or “parent
approvals” or any action taken by Merger Sub or Cintas or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates described in the section entitled
“— Efforts to Consummate the Merger” or the consequences of any

such action; (4) any event, development or change in circumstances generally affecting the principal industries in which G&K or any
of its subsidiaries operate (except to the extent such event, development or change in circumstances would reasonably be expected to
have a disproportionate effect on G&K and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other participants in the industries in which
G&K and its subsidiaries operate); or (5) G&K or any of its subsidiaries exceeding, or failing to meet, internal or external projections,
budgets, guidance, forecasts or estimates of revenues, earnings or other financial metrics for any period (but not the underlying cause
of such event).

Further, at any time after August 15, 2016 and prior to the time the requisite company vote is obtained, if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that an acquisition
proposal made after August 15, 2016 (that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation restrictions of the merger agreement
(other than an immaterial breach)) is a superior proposal, and failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company’s
directors’ fiduciary duties, then the Company Board may (1) make a change of recommendation and/or (2) cause G&K to terminate the
merger agreement and pay a $60 million termination fee to Cintas on or before the termination date.

Prior to making any such change of recommendation or terminating the merger agreement and paying the termination fee with
respect to a superior proposal, (1) G&K must have given Cintas at least four business days’ prior written notice of its intention to
terminate the merger agreement and pay the termination fee, and have provided Cintas the material terms and conditions of, and the
identity of the party making, any such superior proposal and copies of the most current version of the agreement reflecting such terms
and conditions and (2) after providing such notice and prior to taking any such action with respect to a superior proposal, G&K must
have negotiated in good faith with Cintas during such four business day period (to the extent that Cintas indicates to the Company that
Cintas desires to negotiate) with respect to, and must have considered in good faith, any changes to the merger agreement agreed to be
made in writing by Cintas so that such superior proposal ceases to constitute a superior proposal.

In the event that the financial or material terms of an acquisition proposal are modified by the party making the acquisition
proposal after G&K has provided the required notice of the acquisition proposal to Cintas, G&K will provide Cintas with written notice
of the modified acquisition proposal and will again comply with the good faith negotiation arrangements described above, except that
the four business day consideration period will be reduced to three business days.

The non-solicitation restrictions of the merger agreement do not prohibit G&K from complying with its disclosure obligations
under applicable U.S. federal or state law with respect to an acquisition proposal, but G&K may not make a change of recommendation
without complying with the applicable provisions of the merger agreement. Under the merger agreement, any disclosure relating to an
acquisition proposal that does not reaffirm the company recommendation (other than a “stop, look and listen” disclosure by the
Company Board to the shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act) will be deemed to be a change of recommendation.

Existing Discussions or Negotiations

G&K agreed to cease and terminate, as of August 15, 2016, any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any party
(other than Cintas) with respect to an acquisition proposal. G&K has also agreed that, as soon as reasonably practicable, it will ask any
party that has been furnished confidential information by G&K or any of its subsidiaries in the twelve months prior to August 15, 2016
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement and in connection with the consideration by such party of an acquisition of G&K or any of its
subsidiaries to return or destroy such confidential information.

G&K Shareholders’ Meeting

G&K agreed to file this proxy statement with the SEC as promptly as practicable after August 15, 2016, and in any event within
thirty calendar days of such date. G&K also agreed to promptly notify Cintas of the receipt of

all comments of the SEC with respect to the proxy statement and any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or
for any additional information and will promptly provide all copies of correspondence. Each company will use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly respond to any SEC comments. G&K will cause the definitive proxy statement to be mailed to G&K’s shareholders
promptly after the tenth calendar day following the filing of the preliminary proxy statement with the SEC or, in the event the SEC
provides comments on the preliminary proxy statement prior to such time, promptly after the date the SEC advises that it has no further
comments.

G&K has agreed to take, in accordance with applicable law and its governance documents, all action necessary to convene a
meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable (and in any event, within thirty business days) after the mailing of this proxy
statement, for shareholders to consider and vote upon the adoption of the merger agreement (which meeting, and any adjournment or
postponement thereof, is referred to in this proxy statement as the “G&K shareholders’ meeting”). Under the merger agreement,
G&K’s obligations relating to convening the G&K shareholders’ meeting will be unaffected by the consideration of any acquisition
proposal or any change of recommendation by the Company Board. Subject to the provisions of the merger agreement relating to the
consideration of alternative acquisition proposals and a change of recommendation, the Company Board will recommend the adoption
of the merger agreement and will take all lawful action to solicit the requisite company vote at the G&K shareholders’ meeting. G&K
has agreed to keep Cintas reasonably informed regarding the solicitation efforts and proxy tallies following the mailing of this proxy
statement.

G&K may only adjourn or postpone the G&K shareholders’ meeting (1) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining
the requisite company vote, (2) for the absence of a quorum, (3) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure that G&K has determined after consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under
applicable law, and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by G&K’s shareholders prior to the
G&K shareholders’ meeting, (4) if, based on advice of outside legal counsel, failure to adjourn or postpone would reasonably be
expected to be a violation of any applicable order or law, or (5) with the written consent of Cintas, which may be withheld in Cintas’
sole discretion.

Efforts to Consummate the Merger

G&K and Cintas have agreed that prior to the closing of the Merger, Cintas, Merger Sub and G&K will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to ensure all reasonable actions are taken and all reasonable things are done as are necessary, proper, or
advisable to consummate the Merger as promptly as practicable, including (1) preparing and filing all forms, registrations and
notifications required to be filed to consummate the Merger, (2) using reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions to consummating
the Merger, (3) using reasonable best efforts to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization,
expiration or termination of a waiting period, permit, order or approval of, waiver or any exemption by, any governmental entity
required to be obtained or made by Cintas, Merger Sub, G&K or any of their respective subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, (4)
defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the
consummation of the Merger, (5) using reasonable best efforts to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent,
approval of, waiver or any exemption by, any non-governmental third party, in each case, to the extent necessary, proper or advisable in
connection with the Merger, and (6) the execution and delivery of any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of the merger agreement.

G&K and Cintas will each keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work
cooperatively to obtain all required consents, authorizations, orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any governmental entity that
are required under the merger agreement. G&K and Cintas have each agreed that, prior to the closing, each will promptly (1) consult
with the other parties to the merger agreement and provide any necessary information and assistance as the other parties may
reasonably request with respect to all notices, submissions or filings made by or on behalf of such party with any governmental entity
and

(2) inform the other parties to the merger agreement of any communication from or to any governmental entity regarding the Merger,
and permit the other parties the opportunity to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other parties
in connection with, any proposed communication or submission with any such governmental entity to the extent practicable, provided
that Cintas will have the principal responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust
consents or approvals.

None of the parties to the merger agreement may participate in any substantive meeting with any governmental entity in
connection with the merger agreement or the Merger without first consulting with the other parties and (unless prohibited by the
applicable governmental entity) giving the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate in any such meeting. However,
pursuant to the confidentiality agreement and the joint defense agreement between G&K and Cintas, each may reasonably designate, to
the extent it deems advisable and necessary, any competitively sensitive material provided to the other as “outside counsel only
material.” Outside counsel only material will not be disclosed to employees, officers or directors of Cintas or G&K, as the case may be,
without the express advance permission from the party supplying such information or its legal counsel.

G&K and Cintas have also agreed to use reasonable best efforts to make or file with the appropriate governmental entity all
filings, forms, registrations and notifications required to consummate the Merger under any applicable antitrust law, and to furnish all
requested information and documentary material under the HSR Act or any other antitrust law. G&K and Cintas have agreed to file,
within twenty business days after August 15, 2016, their notification and report forms under the HSR Act and a notification pursuant to
the Competition Act (Canada) with the Competition Commissioner, and Cintas has agreed to make a submission in support of an
advance ruling certificate or no-action letter to the Competition Commissioner within such time. In the event that the parties receive a
Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material (which we refer to in this proxy statement as a “second request”)
pursuant to the HSR Act or the Competition Act (Canada), the parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to submit
appropriate responses to, and to certify compliance with, such second request as promptly as practicable, with coordination among
legal counsel for the respective parties throughout such process. Neither G&K nor Cintas may delay compliance with a second request
beyond six months from August 15, 2016, other than pursuant to a timing, settlement, or similar agreement that was executed in
compliance with the merger agreement (as described below).

G&K and Cintas have agreed that neither will enter into, without the prior written consent of the other, any timing, settlement or
similar agreement that would (1) extend, suspend, lengthen, or otherwise toll the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act beyond the date that is six months after August 15, 2016 or (2) bind or commit the parties to refrain from
completing the Merger, or otherwise prevent or prohibit the parties from completing the Merger, prior to a date that is six months after
August 15, 2016.

Divestitures and Triggering Divestiture

If necessary to obtain the requisite antitrust clearances, G&K and Cintas have agreed, as promptly as practicable, (1) to propose,
negotiate, commit to, effect and agree to the sale, divestiture, license, holding separate, and other disposition of the businesses, assets,
properties, products, product lines, and equity interests of G&K, Cintas, or their respective subsidiaries, and to take such action or
actions that would in the aggregate have a similar effect, (2) create, terminate, or divest relationships, ventures, contractual rights or
obligations of G&K, Cintas and their respective subsidiaries, and (3) otherwise take or commit to take any action that would limit
Cintas’ freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity interests,
product lines or properties of G&K, Cintas and their respective subsidiaries. The parties have agreed to the foregoing only to the extent
any such sales, divestitures, licenses, holdings, dispositions, restrictions, changes or similar effects become effective only from and
after the effective time of the Merger. In addition, neither Cintas nor G&K are required to take or commit to taking any divestiture,
license, holding separate, sale or other disposition of or with respect to the “CINTAS” trademark or tradename of Cintas or that would
constitute a “triggering divestiture” under the merger agreement. For purposes of the merger

agreement, a triggering divestiture is the divestiture, license, holding separate, sale or other disposition of or relating to any of the
products, product lines, services or service lines, in whole or in part, of G&K or Cintas or their respective subsidiaries, representing in
excess of $300 million in the aggregate of net sales (measured for G&K’s fiscal year ended July 2, 2016 and Cintas’ fiscal year ended
May 31, 2016), except that any related assets, businesses, properties or equity interests will not be included in the calculation of net
assets.

G&K and Cintas have agreed that they will use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any administrative or judicial action
that is instituted or threatened to be instituted challenging the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as
violative of any antitrust law, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger; provided, that Cintas will bear all costs and expenses associated with the
foregoing.

Access

Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, during the period from August 15, 2016 until the earlier of the termination of the
merger agreement in accordance with its terms and the effective time, G&K and its subsidiaries must afford the officers and
representatives of Cintas reasonable access during normal business hours to G&K’s employees, properties, books, contracts and
records and such other information concerning its business, properties and personnel (other than trade secrets of third parties or
information that would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or conflict with any law or contract to which G&K or its subsidiaries are
bound, including confidentiality agreements).

Financing and Financing Cooperation

In connection with signing the merger agreement, Cintas delivered to G&K a true, complete and correct copy of the fully
executed debt commitment letter, dated as of August 15, 2016, pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein, the financing sources party thereto have agreed to lend Cintas a total of $2.3 billion for the purpose of funding in part the
merger consideration and related amounts. Cintas has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, advisable or proper to obtain the financing contemplated by the debt financing
commitment letter on or prior to the closing date on the terms and conditions described in the debt financing commitment letter. G&K
will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to provide all customary cooperation reasonably requested by Cintas
that is necessary in connection with the financing. There is, however, no financing condition to Cintas’ obligation to consummate the
Merger.

Employee Matters

The merger agreement provides that, effective as of the effective time and during the one-year period immediately following the
effective time (the “continuation period”), Cintas will cause the surviving corporation to provide, to each employee of G&K or its
subsidiaries who continues to be employed by G&K or any of its subsidiaries following the effective time (which we refer to in this
proxy statement as “Company employees”), base wages or salary, bonus opportunities and benefits substantially comparable to those
provided to similarly situated employees of Cintas. Cintas has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to continue G&K’s Executive
Severance and Change in Control Policy and a severance program meeting certain terms established by the merger agreement and the
company disclosure letter delivered in connection with the merger agreement for the duration of the continuation period. Cintas has
also agreed to cause the surviving corporation to continue a retention program consistent with the terms of the merger agreement and
the company disclosure letter delivered in connection with the merger agreement.

Under the merger agreement, following the closing date, Cintas will use reasonable best efforts to cause pre-existing conditions or
limitations, actively-at-work requirements and eligibility waiting periods under group

health plans of Cintas or its affiliates that the Company employees are eligible to participate in to be waived with respect to the
Company employees and their eligible dependents to the extent the same would be waived or satisfied under a similar benefit plan
provided by G&K prior to the effective time. Cintas has also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to give each Company
employee credit for the plan year in which the effective time occurs towards applicable deductibles, coinsurance, and annual out of
pocket limits. Under the merger agreement Cintas will give each Company employee service credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting credit under the Cintas benefit plans for each Continuing employee’s employment with G&K prior to the
effective time, provided that such credit was allowed under an applicable G&K plan prior to the effective time and that granting such
credit would not result in a duplication of benefits.

Indemnification and Insurance

Under the terms of the merger agreement, Cintas has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of
expenses to, the present and former officers and directors of G&K and its subsidiaries (when acting in such capacity) against any costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities that are incurred in
connection with any civil, criminal, administrative or other similar proceeding, litigation, audit, investigation, arbitration, action, suit,
review, examination, inquiry, hearing, demand, claim or similar action, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
effective time of the Merger (including in connection with the approval of the merger agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby or arising out of or pertaining to such transactions) to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
authorized to indemnify such indemnified persons under its articles of incorporation or bylaws in effect on August 15, 2016 agreement.
Cintas has also agreed that it or the surviving company will advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent authorized under
applicable law; provided, that the indemnified person to whom expenses are advanced provides the undertaking required by applicable
law to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such indemnified person is not entitled to indemnification.

Cintas has also agreed to include provisions for indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the indemnified
persons in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving company and maintain such provisions to the fullest extend
authorized under law on the same basis as set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company in effect on the date
of the merger agreement for a period of at least six years following the effective time of the Merger.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company is required to obtain, and if the Company is unable, Cintas will cause the
surviving corporation to obtain, prior to the effective time, a “tail” insurance policy for the extension of the directors’ and officers’
liability coverage provided under G&K’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years
after the effective time and from an insurance carrier with a comparable or better credit rating than G&K’s insurance carrier as of
August 15, 2016, subject to certain qualifications. If for any reason the aforementioned tail policy is not obtained, the merger
agreement requires Cintas to cause the surviving corporation to (i) maintain G&K’s current directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage
or (ii) purchase comparable directors’ and officers’ insurance coverage, in each case, for a period of at least six years after the effective
time, subject to certain qualifications.

Shareholder Litigation

If any shareholder litigation relating to the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement is brought
or threatened in writing against G&K or the members of the Company Board prior to the effective time, G&K has agreed to (1)
promptly notify Cintas and keep Cintas reasonably informed as to the status of such matters, and (2) provide Cintas with the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of such litigation. Further, neither G&K nor any of its subsidiaries or
representatives is permitted to settle, compromise or agree to settle or compromise any such litigation unless Cintas consents to such
action in writing.

•  at any time if neither Cintas nor Merger Sub is then in material breach of the merger agreement and there has been a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by G&K under the merger agreement, or any

certain provisions of the merger agreement relating to the payment of the parties’ expenses, the sections of the merger agreement

incurred in connection with the Merger, the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement will be paid

ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION (PROPOSAL 2)

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, the Company is providing its
shareholders with a separate advisory (non-binding) vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the
Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as described in the table entitled “Golden Parachute
Compensation” under “The Merger (Proposal 1) — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
— Information Regarding Golden Parachute Compensation,” including the footnotes to the table and related narrative discussion.

The Company Board recommends that the shareholders of the Company approve the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in
connection with the Merger, and the agreement or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become
payable, in each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the table in the section entitled “The Merger
(Proposal 1) — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Information Regarding Golden
Parachute Compensation,” including the footnotes to the table and the related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”

The vote on the named executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the
proposal to approve the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the merger agreement and vote not to approve the
named executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer
Merger-related compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either the Company or Cintas. Accordingly, if the
merger agreement is adopted and the Merger is completed, the compensation may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named
executive officers in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements or arrangements even if the shareholders fail to
approve the proposal.

The above resolution approving the Merger-related compensation of the Company’s named executive officers on an advisory
basis requires the affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of (i) a majority of the voting power of shares present and entitled to
vote or (ii) a majority of the voting power of the minimum number of shares entitled to vote that would constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business at the annual meeting.

THE COMPANY BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE NAMED EXECUTIVE
OFFICER MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION PROPOSAL.

ADJOURNMENT OF ANNUAL MEETING (PROPOSAL 3)

We are asking you to approve a proposal to approve one or more adjournments of the annual meeting to a later date or dates if
necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to approve the merger agreement at the time of the
annual meeting. If our shareholders approve the adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the annual meeting and any adjourned session
of the annual meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from shareholders
that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the merger agreement. Among other things,
approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes
against adoption of the merger agreement such that the proposal to approve the merger agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn
the annual meeting without a vote on the adoption of the merger agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change
their votes to vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the annual meeting if a quorum
is not present at the annual meeting.

If the annual meeting is so adjourned, the Company’s shareholders of record, who have already submitted their proxies, will be
able to revoke them at any time prior to their use. The affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of (i) a majority of the voting power
of shares present and entitled to vote or (ii) a majority of the voting power of the minimum number of shares entitled to vote that would
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the annual meeting is required for approval of the proposal for the adjournment of
the annual meeting to solicit additional proxies.

THE COMPANY BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE ADJOURNMENT OF
THE ANNUAL MEETING, IF NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE, TO SOLICIT ADDITIONAL PROXIES IF THERE ARE
NOT SUFFICIENT VOTES TO APPROVE THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

GOVERNANCE OF THE COMPANY

Board of Directors and Committees

Board of Directors

Our board believes that there is no single, generally accepted approach to providing board leadership and that, given the dynamic
and competitive environment in which we operate, the right board leadership structure may vary as circumstances warrant. To that end,
our board has combined the role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our board believes that the Chief Executive Officer is best
situated to serve as Chairman because he is the director most familiar with the company’s business and industry and is therefore best
able to identify the strategic priorities to be discussed by our board. Our board also believes that combining the role of Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer facilitates information flow between management and our board and fosters strategic development and
execution. Our board also has a Lead Director, whose responsibilities include:
 

 
•  presiding at any meeting of our board at which the Chairman is not present, including at executive sessions for independent

directors, at meetings or portions of meetings on topics where the Chairman or our board raises a possible conflict, and when
requested by the Chairman;

 

 •  calling meetings of the independent directors, at such time and place as he determines;
 

 •  serving as a liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors;
 

 •  approving any information sent to him by management for distribution to our board;
 

 
•  approving meeting agendas for our board, including approving meeting schedules to ensure sufficient time is set aside to

discuss relevant matters; and
 

 •  if requested by major shareholders, ensuring that he is available for consultation and direct communication.

Our board believes combining the role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, together with a strong, independent Lead
Director, provides the appropriate leadership and oversight and facilitates effective functioning of both our board and management.
Additionally, our board maintains effective independent oversight through a number of governance practices, including open and direct
communication with management, input on meeting agendas, annual performance evaluations and regular executive sessions.

Our board has also established the following permanent committees to assist with providing oversight to the company: an Audit
Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Corporate Governance Committee. Our board has adopted a written charter for each of
these committees, copies of which are available at our website at http://www.gkservices.com.

Our board held ten meetings during fiscal year 2016 and took action by written consent five times. Each of our directors attended
more than seventy-five percent of the meetings of our board and the committees of our board on which such director served during the
2016 fiscal year.

Director Attendance at Annual Meetings of Shareholders

We do not have a formal policy with respect to attendance by board members at the annual meeting of shareholders, but all
directors are encouraged to attend, and we attempt to coordinate scheduling of our annual meeting of shareholders to accommodate
attendance by directors. All of our directors attended our fiscal year 2015 annual meeting of shareholders.

Independence

With the exception of Mr. Milroy, all of the members of our board are independent within the meaning of applicable NASDAQ
Global Select Market and SEC rules. When considering the independence of directors, our

board determined that the following relationships did not impair the independence of the respective director: Ms. Crump-Caine’s
service as a director of Krispy Kreme, a customer; Mses. Crump-Caine’s and Richter’s service as directors of Thrivent Financial, to
which G&K pays interest on its debt facility; Mr. Fortun’s service as a director of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, a supplier; and Mr.
Greco’s prior position with Frito-Lay, a business unit of PepsiCo, both of which are customers, and his current position with Advance
Auto Parts, a customer. All of the transactions with Krispy Kreme, Thrivent Financial, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Frito-Lay, PepsiCo
and Advance Auto Parts were conducted on arm’s length terms in the ordinary course of business, and the amount involved with the
transactions represents less than 1% of our revenues and 1% of the respective customer’s or supplier’s revenues.

Board Oversight of Company Risk

We rely on our comprehensive enterprise risk management (ERM) process to aggregate, monitor, measure and manage risks.
Through our ERM process, our management, with board oversight, works to identify, assess and manage enterprise risks that may
affect our ability to execute our corporate strategy and fulfill our business objectives. As a part of our ERM process, management
regularly reviews the effectiveness of our risk management practices and capabilities to determine our risk exposure. Management then
elevates certain key risks for discussion at the board level. Our board, with the assistance of management, also annually reviews the
effectiveness of our ERM program. Our ERM program is overseen by our board. Our Chief Financial Officer and our Vice President
and General Counsel, both of whom are members of our executive team, and our Director of Integrated Risk Management have day-to-
day management responsibility for this program.

Additionally, our Audit Committee is primarily responsible for oversight of our policies and practices concerning internal control
over financial reporting and risk assessments related thereto. Our Audit Committee reviews and takes appropriate action with respect to
the company’s annual and quarterly financial statements, the internal audit program, the external audit process and results and
disclosures made with respect to the company’s internal controls. To facilitate these risk oversight responsibilities, the committee
receives regular briefings from members of management on the internal audit plan, Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 compliance, any
significant litigation, ethics matters and health, safety and environmental matters. The committee also regularly holds executive
sessions with representatives of our independent public accounting firm.

In addition to the Audit Committee’s role in financial risk oversight, each of the other board committees considers risk as it
relates to its particular areas of responsibility. Our Compensation Committee oversees and administers our incentive and equity
compensation programs to ensure that the programs create incentives for strong operational performance and for the long-term benefit
of the company and its shareholders without incentivizing undue risk. The committee receives regular briefings from our Vice
President, Human Resources, our Vice President and General Counsel, our Senior Director, HR Operations and the committee’s
retained Compensation Consultant. Finally, our Corporate Governance Committee oversees risks related to board composition and
governance matters and receives regular briefings from our Vice President and General Counsel.

Consideration of Director Candidates

The Corporate Governance Committee, together with the Chairman of our board and other directors, recruits director candidates
and presents qualified candidates to our board for consideration. At each annual shareholders’ meeting, our board proposes to the
shareholders a slate of nominees for election or re-election to our board. Shareholders may propose director nominees for consideration
by the Corporate Governance Committee by submitting a recommendation in writing to the Chair of the Corporate Governance
Committee, in care of our Corporate Secretary at our headquarters address.

If the Corporate Governance Committee approves a candidate for further review following an initial screening, it establishes an
interview process for the candidate. Generally, the candidate meets with members of

the Corporate Governance Committee and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Contemporaneously with the interview process,
the Corporate Governance Committee will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the candidate. The Corporate Governance
Committee will consider reports of the interviews and the assessment to determine whether to recommend the candidate to our board.
The Corporate Governance Committee will also take into consideration the candidate’s personal attributes, including personal
integrity, concern for the company’s success and welfare, willingness to apply sound and independent business judgment, awareness of
a director’s vital role in our good corporate citizenship and image, time available for meetings and consultation on company matters
and willingness to assume broad fiduciary responsibility. Shareholders who wish to nominate a candidate for election to our board at
the annual meeting must comply with our advance notice bylaw described elsewhere in this proxy statement.

Board Composition, Diversity and Tenure

Qualified director candidates, whether identified by shareholders or otherwise, will be considered without regard to race, color,
religion, sex, ancestry, national origin or disability. The Corporate Governance Committee will consider each candidate’s general
business and industry experience, the candidate’s ability to act on behalf of shareholders, overall board diversity, potential concerns
regarding independence or conflicts of interest and other factors relevant in evaluating board nominees. As a matter of practice, our
Corporate Governance Committee considers a number of factors in its evaluation of diversity, including diversity with respect to
viewpoint, skills, experience, community involvement, geography, age, race, gender and ethnicity. These factors enhance the
perspectives and values that are discussed in board and committee meetings. As indicated below, our current board composition reflects
this approach and our board’s commitment to diversity:
 

 •  25% of our non-employee directors are women;
 

 •  12% of our non-employee directors are minorities;
 

 
•  four of our directors have served eight or fewer years, providing a balance between fresh perspectives and deep knowledge

of our company; and
 

 
•  two of our directors, both of whom have served for two years, are currently working in Chief Executive Officer positions,

providing valuable management insight.

We believe that the current mix of tenure, backgrounds and experiences of our directors enhances the quality of our board’s
deliberations and decisions.

Corporate Governance Committee

We have established a Corporate Governance Committee of the Company Board comprised solely of “independent directors” (as
defined by applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, NASDAQ Global Select Market and other relevant regulatory bodies), one of
whom also serves on the Compensation Committee of the Company Board. The Corporate Governance Committee operates pursuant
to a written charter adopted by our board. The primary roles of the Corporate Governance Committee are to monitor the effectiveness
of our board in carrying out certain responsibilities, to assure appropriate board composition, to recommend a Chief Executive Officer
and to facilitate our board’s annual review of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer’s performance and the operation of our board
and its various committees. In addition, the Corporate Governance Committee presents qualified director candidates to the full board
and considers qualified nominees recommended by shareholders.

The Corporate Governance Committee, which presently consists of Chair Mr. Mrozek and Messrs. Bronson and Pippin, held four
meetings during fiscal year 2016, all of which were held in person, and did not take action by written consent. The Chair and members
of the Corporate Governance Committee are appointed by our board.

Audit Committee

We have established an Audit Committee of the Company Board which assists our board in fulfilling certain oversight
responsibilities and consists solely of independent directors. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a written charter adopted by
our board. As set forth in the charter, the primary responsibilities of the Audit Committee include serving as an independent and
objective party to monitor our financial reporting process and the system of internal control over financial reporting, reviewing and
appraising the audit results of our independent auditors and internal audit department, and providing an open avenue of communication
among the independent auditors, financial and senior management, the internal audit department and our board. The charter also
requires that the Audit Committee appoint our independent auditors and review and pre-approve the performance of all audit and non-
audit accounting services to be performed by our independent auditors, other than services falling within the de minimis exceptions
permitted under Section 202 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

The Audit Committee, which presently consists of Chair Ms. Richter, Ms. Crump-Caine and Messrs. Mrozek and Schram, held
eight meetings during fiscal year 2016, four of which were held in person and four of which were conducted by telephone, and did not
take action by written consent. The Audit Committee met and held discussions with management and representatives of our
independent auditors prior to the public release of earnings information for each of our completed fiscal periods, and prior to each
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K being filed with the SEC.

Our board has determined that each of Ms. Richter and Mr. Mrozek is an “Audit Committee Financial Expert,” as that term is
defined in Item 407(d)(5) of SEC Regulation S-K. In addition, each member of the Audit Committee is an “independent director,” as
such term is defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Global Select Market’s listing standards, and meets the criteria for
independence set forth in Rule 5605(c)(2) of the NASDAQ Global Select Market’s listing standards and Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the
Exchange Act. Our board has also determined that each of the Audit Committee members is able to read and understand financial
statements and that at least one member of the Audit Committee has past employment experience in finance or accounting.

Compensation Committee

The Compensation Committee, which operates pursuant to a written charter adopted by the Company Board, presently consists of
Chair Mr. Fortun and Messrs. Bronson and Greco, held three meetings during fiscal year 2016, all of which were held in person, and
did not take action by written consent. All members of the Compensation Committee are “independent directors” according to the
NASDAQ Global Select Market’s Rule 5605(d)(2) and “non-employee directors” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3(b)(3) under the
Exchange Act. The Compensation Committee reviews our compensation policies and practices and makes recommendations to the
independent members of our board in connection with all compensation matters affecting our NEOs. A description of the processes and
procedures for considering and determining executive compensation is included in the “Executive Compensation — Compensation
Discussion and Analysis” section of this proxy statement.

In February 2016, the Compensation Committee engaged Frederick W. Cook & Co., Inc. (F.W. Cook) as its independent
compensation consultant to provide independent compensation consultation and advice to the Compensation Committee to assist in
aligning executive compensation with the long-term interests of shareholders and our corporate goals and strategies and ensuring our
compensation remains competitive. As requested by the Compensation Committee, F.W. Cook provides guidance as it relates to the
following committee responsibilities:
 

 •  reviews Compensation Committee agendas and supporting materials in advance of each meeting;
 

 •  as requested, attends Compensation Committee meetings;
 

 
•  makes recommendations on companies to include in our peer group, analyzes the selected peer group information and

reviews other survey data for competitive comparisons;

 •  reviews our executive compensation programs and competitive positioning for reasonableness and appropriateness;
 

 
•  reviews our total executive compensation program and advises the Compensation Committee of plans or practices that might

be changed to improve effectiveness;
 

 •  reviews survey data on executive pay practices and amounts that come before the Compensation Committee;
 

 
•  provides market data and recommendations on Chairman and Chief Executive Officer compensation without prior review by

management, except for necessary fact checking;
 

 •  provides market data and recommendations on director compensation;
 

 
•  reviews any significant executive employment or change-in-control provisions in advance of being presented to the

Compensation Committee and/or our board for approval;

In fiscal year 2016, as part of its ongoing services to the Compensation Committee, an F.W. Cook representative attended two
meetings of the Compensation Committee and worked on the following projects:
 

 •  participated in reviewing our Compensation Committee charter;
 

 •  participated in review and design of our long-term incentive and equity program;
 

 •  participated in reviewing and updating our peer group; and
 

 
•  conducted market analysis and made recommendations for changes to the fiscal year 2017 compensation package for our

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Additionally, prior to the engagement of F.W. Cook, Willis Towers Watson, the Compensation Committee’s former consultant,
provided recommendations on Mr. Milroy’s fiscal year 2016 compensation, conducted market analysis of board of director
compensation and made recommendations on changes to our director compensation for fiscal year 2016.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

During fiscal year 2016, no member of our Compensation Committee was an officer, former officer or employee of the company
or any of its subsidiaries. During fiscal year 2016, none of our executive officers served as a member of (i) the compensation
committee of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, (ii) the
board of directors of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, or
(iii) the compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions, or in the absence of any such committee,
the entire board of directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as a member of our board.

Compensation Paid to Board Members

During fiscal year 2016, we paid each director who was not otherwise employed by us an annual retainer of $55,000. We paid to
members of the Audit, Compensation, and Governance Committees an annual retainer of

Table of Contents

$10,000, $6,000, and $5,000, respectively. We paid to Mr. Pippin, the former Lead Director of our board, an additional $5,625 retainer,
as well as an additional $2,500 for serving as the Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee for one meeting during the fiscal
year. Similarly, we paid to Mr. Mrozek, the current Lead Director, a $16,875 retainer, as well as a $7,500 retainer for serving as the
Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee for three meetings during the fiscal year. Finally, we paid a $20,000 retainer to Ms.
Richter, Chair of the Audit Committee, and a $12,000 retainer to Mr. Fortun, Chair of the Compensation Committee.

In addition, directors who are not otherwise employed by the company are eligible to participate in the Restated Equity Incentive
Plan (2013). For fiscal year 2016, each non-employee director was awarded a restricted stock grant of 1,746 shares, equivalent to
approximately $105,000, based on the closing price of G&K common stock on the date of grant. Each restricted stock grant vests in
equal installments over a period of three years, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Directors must remain in service for
restricted stock and options to vest; therefore, any unvested grants will be forfeited upon termination of service to our board. All option
and restricted stock grants made to directors January 1, 2015 or later contain additional retirement vesting provisions. Specifically, such
grants include an accelerated vesting provision whereby, upon a director’s qualified retirement, the unvested portion of such grants will
continue to vest in two equal installments over a two-year period following such qualified retirement. A qualified retirement is defined
as a director’s voluntary termination of service as a director on attaining the age of 70, the mandatory retirement age, or, if earlier, after
completing at least 12 consecutive years of service as a director. We have in place stock ownership requirements for our non-employee
directors. Specifically, each of our non-employee directors is required to own a minimum number of shares equal to five times the
director’s annual base retainer. Each director must achieve this level no more than five years after becoming a director. Once achieved,
each director must maintain this ownership level at all times during the director’s tenure with the company. The Compensation
Committee annually reviews the progress against the ownership requirements, and each of our non-employee directors is either on
track to achieve or has achieved ownership requirements.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Executive Summary

The primary objective of our compensation program is to provide competitive compensation and benefit plans that enable us to
attract, motivate and retain highly qualified, experienced executives and reward them for performance that creates long-term
shareholder value. We strive to reward our NEOs fairly and competitively through a mix of base salary, short- and long-term
incentives, benefits, career growth and development opportunities. We believe this mix drives company performance and assists with
employee retention. Our NEOs for fiscal year 2016 were the following individuals:
 

 •  Douglas A. Milroy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer;
 

 •  Tracy C. Jokinen, Chief Financial Officer;
 

 •  Jeffrey L. Cotter, Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary;
 

 •  Ian G. Davis, Vice President, U.S. Field; and
 

 •  Kevin A. Fancey, President, G&K Services Canada.

Fiscal year 2016 was another strong year for G&K Services. We made good progress in the first year since setting our 15/5
Goals. Total revenue grew 4.3%, to $978 million, with 4% organic growth. Operating margin increased 60 basis points to 12.5%,
compared to adjusted operating margin of 11.9% in the prior year. Return on invested capital improved by 140 basis points to 12.6%,
compared to 11.2% in fiscal year 2015. This progress toward our goals helped drive company record earnings of $3.61 per diluted
share. Cash flow from operations also reached a new company record of $134 million, up 42% over last year. We believe that our
management team’s leadership and commitment to our strategic plan directly impacted our fiscal year 2016 performance and that the
compensation of our NEOs appropriately rewarded them for these achievements. See Annex D for a table reconciling the fiscal year
2015 reported amounts to the adjusted amounts.

In structuring the fiscal year 2016 compensation program for our NEOs, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board
considered a number of factors, including our financial and business results, the general economic outlook, individual performance and
responsibilities, experience, competitive data and our board-approved financial plan for the fiscal year. Consistent with that financial
plan, our Compensation Committee included in our fiscal year 2016 executive compensation program challenging financial
performance targets.

Within this framework, and reflecting its assessment of company and individual performance during fiscal year 2016, our
Compensation Committee took the following actions regarding compensation for our NEOs during fiscal year 2016:
 

 
•  approved increases to the base salaries of Mr. Milroy of 6.3%, Mr. Davis and Ms. Jokinen of 5.0%, and Messrs. Fancey and

Cotter of 4.0%;
 

 
•  approved annual cash incentive payouts for fiscal year 2016 under our Management Incentive Plan (referred to as our MIP)

that reflected performance at 83% of target for qualified performance-based measures;
 

 
•  granted to Mr. Milroy long-term equity awards, the grant date fair value of which was allocated 50% restricted stock and

50% stock options and which was set at 120% of his target grant value; and
 

 
•  granted to our other NEOs long-term equity awards whose grant date fair value was allocated 60% restricted stock and 40%

stock options and reflected between 120% and 130% of the NEO’s respective target grant value.

We believe that our compensation program is reasonable and market competitive, that it fairly reflects our performance over time
and that it aligns the interests of our NEOs with the interests of our shareholders. We

emphasize compensation opportunities that reward our executives when they meet or exceed targeted qualified performance measures
and individual goals and objectives. The actual total compensation of each NEO varies depending upon individual performance and
responsibilities, experience, competitive market data and the achievement of pre-established individual and corporate performance
goals. Stock ownership guidelines and equity incentives serve to further align the interests of our executives with those of our
shareholders and the long-term goals of the company. Our executive compensation policies have enabled us to attract and retain
talented and experienced senior executives and have benefited our company over time.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

The following Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the material elements of our total compensation program for our
NEOs and specifically addresses the objectives, elements and calculations included in such program. Our NEOs consist of our
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and the three most highly compensated executive officers, other
than our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, who were serving as our executive officers at the end
of fiscal year 2016. This discussion focuses on our compensation program and decisions in fiscal year 2016, each as they relate to these
individuals; we also address why we believe the program is right for our company and our shareholders, and we explain how
compensation is determined.

Responsibility for Executive Compensation Determinations

The Compensation Committee of the Company Board, which consists entirely of independent directors and whose membership is
determined by our board, is responsible for:
 

 •  approving the design and implementation of our executive compensation program for both NEOs and non-NEO executives;
 

 
•  receiving and evaluating input from the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant for the Chairman

and Chief Executive Officer’s compensation and input from both management and the compensation consultant for the
remaining NEOs’ compensation;

 

 
•  annually reviewing NEO compensation and developing compensation recommendations for our board, after which only our

independent directors vote on NEO compensation;
 

 •  assessing risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for our employees;
 

 •  regularly reporting on committee actions and recommendations at board meetings; and
 

 •  working with the Audit and Corporate Governance Committees of the Company Board, as appropriate.

Our Compensation Committee engaged Willis Towers Watson to serve as an independent compensation consultant for the early
part of fiscal year 2016. Willis Towers Watson served the committee in this role beginning in 2012. Effective February 2016, the
Compensation Committee replaced Willis Towers Watson with F.W. Cook, which now serves as the committee’s independent
compensation consultant. The consulting and advisory services provided by F.W. Cook and Willis Towers Watson to our Compensation
Committee in connection with executive and director compensation were described previously in this proxy statement in the section
“Governance of the Company — Compensation Committee.” The Compensation Committee also works with our human resources,
compensation and benefits and legal professionals on the design and implementation of executive compensation programs and

Canadian registered plans and retirement compensation arrangements and to our labor relations personnel with regard to, among other
things, union issues.

Certain of our senior officers have roles in the compensation process, as follows:
 

 
•  each NEO, other than the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, provides a self-evaluation prior to the NEO’s performance

review with Mr. Milroy;
 

 
•  Mr. Milroy conducts a performance review of each NEO to assess such NEO’s performance against business and individual

performance objectives, to note any significant strengths and accomplishments, and to note challenges and areas for
improvement;

 

 
•  Mr. Milroy recommends compensation actions (base salary and equity grant) with respect to our NEOs, other than for

himself, and submits those recommendations to the Compensation Committee for review;
 

 •  Mr. Milroy conducts an assessment of his performance during the fiscal year, which he reviews with our board;
 

 
•  Mr. Milroy provides his perspective on recommendations provided by the Compensation Committee’s consultant regarding

compensation program design issues;
 

 
•  our Vice President, Human Resources, in consultation with our Senior Director, HR Operations, provides input on plan

design, structure and cost, and assesses the implications of all recommendations on recruitment, retention and motivation of
company employees, as well as company financial results; and

 

 

•  when requested by the Compensation Committee, other officers, such as our Chief Financial Officer, Vice President and
Controller, and our Vice President and General Counsel, may also review recommendations on plan design, structure and
cost, and provide a perspective to the Compensation Committee on how these recommendations may affect recruitment,
retention and motivation of our employees, as well as our financial results.

Our independent directors also have roles in the compensation process, as follows:
 

 •  each independent director completes an evaluation of Mr. Milroy’s performance;
 

 
•  the Corporate Governance Committee summarizes the results and presents them to our board, which engages with Mr.

Milroy in a discussion regarding his performance; and
 

 
•  the independent directors vote on all compensation recommendations for our NEOs, consistent with the requirements of

Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, discussed more fully below.

Objectives of our Compensation Program

The primary objective of our compensation program is to provide competitive compensation and benefit plans that enable us to
attract, motivate and retain highly qualified, experienced executives and to reward them for performance that creates long-term
shareholder value. We seek to increase shareholder value by rewarding performance with competitive compensation that ensures a
direct link between pay, company performance and results for our shareholders. Base salary, short- and long-term incentive
opportunities will differ among NEOs due to the differing levels of roles and responsibilities of each NEO, experience, competitive
market data and the achievement of individual and corporate performance goals. We strive to drive performance and reward employees
fairly and competitively through a mix of base salary, short- and long-term incentives, benefits, career growth and development
opportunities. We believe that our base pay, short- and long-term incentives and other benefits are sufficiently balanced between short-
term and long-term performance and do not encourage unnecessary risk-taking.

Table of Contents

Our compensation program strives to effectively utilize elements of compensation under a total reward philosophy that combines
annual and multi-year reward opportunities designed to reward the achievement of company performance objectives, including long-
term growth in shareholder value and successful execution of our strategic game plan, strong individual initiative and team
performance. Our compensation program also strives to reward the annual achievement of the company’s goals and objectives, while
supporting our long-term business strategy and encouraging our executives to increase shareholder value.

Elements of our Compensation Program

There are five components of our executive compensation program:
 

 •  base salary;
 

 •  MIP (short-term incentives);
 

 •  long-term equity-based compensation;
 

 •  benefits and perquisites; and
 

 •  severance and change-in-control benefits.

We seek to allocate the mix of each of the above components to deliver a market-competitive total compensation package. Base
salary and short- and long-term incentives are reviewed against external market data and peer group data to determine overall
compensation levels. Short- and long-term incentives are expressed as a percentage of base compensation. For fiscal year 2016, based
on market data, we implemented a moderate increase in base salary for all five of our NEOs and an increase in long-term incentives for
Mr. Milroy. We also made changes to target bonus levels for Mr. Fancey. We made no other changes to our offered short-term
incentives.

Base Salary

Base salary is fixed compensation designed to compensate NEOs for their level of experience and continued performance in their
individual roles. Providing executives with competitive base salaries allows us to attract high-caliber talent and retain executives’ on-
going services by providing them with a level of financial certainty. We review executive base salary on an annual basis (generally
comparing to the median of the competitive market for each position), and any increases are based on individual performance and
responsibilities, experience and prevailing market conditions. During fiscal year 2016, we awarded merit pay increases to our NEOs
based on individual performance and overall company performance. Additionally, based on market data, our board approved base
salary adjustments in fiscal year 2016 for five of our NEOs.

For fiscal year 2016, each of our NEO’s annual base salary set by the Compensation Committee (effective September 1, 2015)
reflected the following percentage of the market median: Mr. Milroy — 100%; Ms. Jokinen — 95%; Mr. Davis — 85%; Mr.
Fancey — 103%; and Mr. Cotter — 104%. Each NEO’s actual compensation position relationship to the market median differs due to
job content and responsibilities, experience and individual performance.

Annual Management Incentive Plan (MIP)

Our MIP is a variable pay program tied to achievement of annual business goals. The MIP is designed to compensate NEOs for
meeting specific company financial goals. MIP target incentive levels are based on competitive market data, job content and
responsibilities. Cash incentive awards to our NEOs that are based on qualified performance-based measures may be settled in cash as
performance awards under our Restated Equity Incentive Plan (2013), with terms similar to our MIP awards, so that any payments will
be deductible, as applicable, pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Such an award was granted to all of our NEOs
for fiscal year 2016. For

Table of Contents

ease of reference, we will refer to the MIP-like awards under our Restated Equity Incentive Plan as MIP awards in this discussion.
Target incentive levels for 2016 are expressed as a percentage of base salary, as follows:
 

Position   
Target Incentive

(as a % of Base Salary) 
Douglas A. Milroy    100% 
Tracy C. Jokinen    60% 
Kevin A. Fancey    60% 
Ian G. Davis    60% 
Jeffrey L. Cotter    50% 

As stated above, short-term incentive percentages are compared to market as well as to internal comparisons and will vary based
on each NEO’s position and responsibilities within the company.

Management Incentive Plan Payouts

Our MIP is tied solely to financial goals. We believe this aligns our executive compensation to a pay-for-performance market
approach. Our fiscal year 2016 MIP payout was calculated based on actual performance against financial goals set at the beginning of
the fiscal year. The Compensation Committee chose the qualified performance-based financial measures of revenue, earnings per share
(EPS) and return on invested capital (ROIC) as the key financial measures because they are consistent with our 15/5 goals previously
communicated to our shareholders, best represent our primary short-term financial goals and align with and support the attainment of
our long-term strategy. ROIC is calculated by dividing trailing 12-month adjusted net operating income from continuing operations
after tax (assuming a 37.5% tax rate) by invested capital. Invested capital is equal to the sum of total debt and shareholders’ equity, less
cash. These measures were reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee.

See Annex D for a reconciliation to GAAP for each of the performance-based financial measures used to determine payout
amounts under the MIP.

Plan Measures and Weights and Performance Targets

The MIP measures and weights for fiscal year 2016, as well as the performance targets and results, are as follows:

increases by 16.5%, after which each 1% of consolidated

Table of Contents

 

revenue results in a 16.75% increase in the payout factor. For above target achievement, if consolidated total revenue is between
100% and 102% of target, for each 1% of consolidated total revenue above target, the payout factor increases by 25% up to 150%,
after which each 1% of consolidated revenue over target results in a 50% increase in the payout factor, up to a maximum payout
of 200%. With respect to EPS and ROIC, no payout is made if EPS and ROIC are at or below 80% of target; if EPS and ROIC are
above 80% and below 90% of target, for each additional 1% of achievement, the payout factor increases by 3%; if EPS and ROIC
are above 90% of target, for each additional 1% of achievement, the payout factor increases by 7%. For above target achievement,
if EPS and ROIC are between 100% and 105% of target, for each 1% above the target, the payout factor increases by 10% up to
150%, after which each 0.5% increase over target results in a 10% increase to the payout factor, up to a maximum payout of
200%. Actual results are calculated against plan, and payouts are adjusted accordingly to recognize achievement above the
threshold.

Plan measures and weights were carefully reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee. Performance targets are
recommended prior to each fiscal year based on business unit plans, expected progress toward long-term goals and anticipated market
conditions. The annual performance targets for company revenue, EPS and ROIC are then presented by management to the
Compensation Committee and approved by the committee based on the company’s overall financial plan approved by our board. MIP
payouts for company financial measures are based on actual business results compared to the performance targets, which were
approved at the beginning of the fiscal year. We strive to recognize all achievement between the threshold and maximum levels of
performance; therefore, actual results are calculated against plan, and payouts are adjusted accordingly to recognize achievement above
the threshold. Achievement of the target yields a 100% payout of the incentive. Incentive payouts are calculated using a mathematical
formula which provides a modest incremental payout for performance above threshold, but below target. Greater increments in the
incentive payout are applied for performance above target to incentivize overachievement. For purposes of complying with applicable
provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the MIP payout for all NEOs is paid pursuant to our Restated Equity
Incentive Plan (2013) that was approved by our shareholders.

MIP Calculation for Fiscal Year 2016

The payout for each qualified performance-based measure of an NEO’s MIP calculation is determined by multiplying the
following factors: the NEO’s base salary, the NEOs target incentive percentage, the applicable measure weight and the payout factor.
The total payout is equal to the sum of the payouts for each measure. Our Compensation Committee determines incentive
compensation plan design for financial measures based generally on achievement of certain targets against an internal business plan
approved annually by our board, subject to certain limited adjustments, as discussed in “— Executive Summary” above and in the
footnotes to the table above. Over the past three years, the payout percentage has ranged from 83% to 111% of the target award
opportunity for these measures, with an average payout percentage equal to approximately 96% of the target award opportunity. MIP
payouts are currently capped at 200% of target.

Long-Term Equity Compensation

Long-term equity compensation supports strong organization performance over a period of three to five years, depending on the
type of equity granted. Long-term equity compensation aligns NEOs’ compensation with shareholders’ interests, rewards NEOs for
increasing long-term shareholder value and promotes executive retention. Similar with cash compensation, long-term equity award
targets for each position are established each year based on competitive market data, while taking into account dilution and the rate at
which equity grants deplete the number of shares available for grant. We also consider individual performance when granting equity
awards.

In fiscal year 2016, we granted three types of equity awards:
 

 
•  Non-Qualified Stock Options — each stock option represents the right to purchase a specified number of shares of G&K

common stock at a price equal to the fair market value of G&K common stock on

the date of grant. All options granted to our NEOs during fiscal year 2016 vest and become exercisable in equal installments
over three years, commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date, and have a term of ten years.

 

 
•  Restricted Stock — restricted stock represents the issuance of shares of common stock that are subject to vesting restrictions.

All restricted stock granted to our NEOs during fiscal year 2016 vests in equal installments over five years, commencing on
the first anniversary of the grant date.

 

 

•  Restricted Stock Units — restricted stock units represent the issuance of units of common stock that are subject to vesting
restrictions, and payable in cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of one share of the company’s common stock on
the vesting date times the number of units that vested, after which vested units are canceled. All restricted stock units granted
to our Canadian NEO during fiscal year 2016 vest in equal installments over three years, commencing on the first
anniversary of the grant date.

Grant Targets and Mix

Our annual equity grant practice is to use a combination of stock options (to reward profitable growth) and restricted stock (to
support retention). Each year, we establish target grant values taking into consideration market levels, while still managing annual run
rate and shareholder dilution. For fiscal year 2016, the grant date fair value of the long-term incentive awards for each of our NEOs
consisted of the following percentage of the market median: Mr. Milroy — 120%; Ms. Jokinen — 112%; Mr. Fancey — 114%; Mr.
Davis — 87%; and Mr. Cotter — 104%. With respect to the target expected value of equity compensation grants, for fiscal year 2016
for each of our NEOs other than Mr. Milroy, the Compensation Committee approved an allocation of 40% stock options and 60%
restricted stock. Mr. Milroy’s allocation was 50% stock options and 50% restricted stock. In each case, we believe these allocations
appropriately encourage achievement of our objectives. After establishing the mix, the target grant dollar levels are converted into
shares using the following formulas:
 

 •  Stock Options: (percentage allocated to stock options x target grant dollar level)/Black Scholes value
 

 
•  Restricted Stock: (percentage allocated to restricted stock x target grant dollar level)/per share value of G&K common stock

as of the date of the calculation

Based on the considerations outlined above, in fiscal year 2016, each of our NEOs received equity grants equal to the following
percentage of their respective target dollar value: Mr. Milroy — 120% of $2,160,000 target; Ms. Jokinen — 120% of $400,000 target;
Mr. Fancey — 120% of $375,000 target; Mr. Davis — 120% of $375,000 target; and Mr. Cotter — 130% of $200,000 target. All grants
are based on target values, and final amounts vary based on each respective NEO’s individual performance and responsibilities.

Grant Practice

We make our equity grants as of the date of our August board meeting, which generally occurs after our year-end earnings
announcement. The Compensation Committee may also grant stock options or restricted stock to NEOs at times other than the annual
grant date, e.g., upon hire or promotion, with the price set equal to the closing market price on the date of grant.

Equity Holding Guidelines

We believe that requiring executive officers to hold significant amounts of G&K common stock strengthens the alignment of our
executive officers’ interests with those of our shareholders and promotes achievement of long-term business objectives. Currently, our
NEOs are allowed five years to achieve ownership targets, which are five times base salary for Mr. Milroy and three times base salary
for the remaining NEOs. Additionally, our equity holding guidelines require NEOs to hold one-half of all shares granted, net of the
number of any shares required to cover estimated taxes and exercise costs, until ownership targets are met. The holding requirements

Table of Contents

apply to restricted stock at the time of vesting and stock options at the time of exercise. The Compensation Committee annually
reviews the progress against the ownership guidelines. The five-year measurement period begins on the date of the first equity grant
after the NEO is appointed to our Executive Team. Each of our NEOs has either achieved or is on track to achieve the requisite level of
ownership.

Benefits

Benefits include health and welfare, retirement and perquisite programs that are intended to provide financial protection and
security to NEOs and their families and to reward their dedication and long-term commitment to the company. Our sponsorship
(coupled with competitive employee cost-sharing arrangements) of these plans is critical to our ability to attract and retain the talent we
need to support our overall business objectives. NEOs have the opportunity to participate in the same retirement, health and welfare
plans as our other salaried employees, as well as the following supplemental benefits:
 

 •  Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (DEFCO) (Mr. Fancey is a Canadian employee and is not covered by the plan);
 

 •  executive long-term disability insurance;
 

 
•  financial planning services: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer — $7,500 each calendar year; all other NEOs — $5,000

each calendar year;
 

 •  executive physical; and
 

 
•  weekly taxable car allowance: Mr. Milroy — $375; Mr. Fancey — $238.62 CAD; other NEOs do not receive a car

allowance.

Severance and Change-in-Control Benefits

Depending on the NEO and the reason for termination, severance and change-in-control benefits may include severance
payments, accelerated vesting of equity awards and other benefits that are paid in the event of termination of employment under certain
circumstances, including following a change in control. Severance and change-in-control benefits help attract executive talent and
create an environment that provides for adequate business transition and knowledge transfer during times of change. We have entered
into an employment agreement with Mr. Milroy that provides benefits to Mr. Milroy if, among other things, he is terminated after a
change in control of the company. We also have in place an Executive Severance and Change in Control Policy under which our
remaining NEOs are entitled to certain benefits, including following certain termination and change in control events. This agreement
and policy were put in place and the related triggers were selected to assure that we will have the continued dedication, undivided
loyalty and objective advice and counsel from these key executives in the event of a proposed transaction, or the threat of a transaction,
which could result in a change in control of the company. We also believe that the agreement and policy are beneficial because, in
consideration for these severance arrangements, the executives agree to noncompetition and non-solicitation covenants for a period of
time following termination of employment. The specific post-employment benefits our NEOs may receive are discussed more fully
below.

Table of Contents

Executive compensation is set at levels that the Compensation Committee believes to be competitive with those offered by
selected employers of comparable size, growth and profitability, both in and outside our industry. Annually, the Compensation
Committee reviews all elements of executive compensation, individually and in the aggregate, against market data for companies with
which we compete for executive talent. The Compensation Committee’s consultant works with our internal human resources and
compensation and benefits professionals in conducting research and formulating recommendations for the Compensation Committee’s
consideration to determine the levels and components of compensation to be provided for the fiscal year. The consultant also provides
background material for consideration by the Compensation Committee with respect to compensation for Mr. Milroy. The
Compensation Committee evaluates our executive compensation based on competitive market information obtained from proxy data
from a peer group of 16 publicly-traded companies that have one or more of the following factors in common with our company:
similar industry sector (business services), similar size (revenue, capitalization, number of employees) or geographic proximity to our
company. The Compensation Committee also evaluates competitive market information by reviewing general survey data from
similarly sized companies.

We benchmark the total direct compensation of our NEOs, consisting of base salary, MIP and long-term equity, against our peer
group. In addition, our compensation professionals provide supporting market data and analysis to the Compensation Committee.
While we consider data from both sources for setting compensation for all of our NEOs, we rely on peer group data more heavily for
Mr. Milroy and Ms. Jokinen, as the peer group has more reliable comparisons for their positions. When we deliver targeted financial
results, we determine total direct compensation (base salary, cash bonus and equity awards) by considering both the 50th percentile of
our peer group and the median of the market data. We assess our position against the 50th percentile or market median as a percent,
100% equating to the 50th percentile or market median. We seek to pay our executives fairly and to directly link pay to performance,
with incentive compensation based on the performance criteria previously discussed. For fiscal year 2016, incentive compensation
(annual cash bonus and equity awards) accounted for approximately 81% of the total direct compensation of Mr. Milroy and 62% of
the average total direct compensation of our other NEOs.

Peer Group Data

The various total direct compensation elements of our executive compensation program for fiscal year 2016 were benchmarked
relative to the compensation provided to executives of the following companies:
 

 •  Apogee Enterprises, Inc.

 •  The Toro Company
 

 •  TrueBlue Inc.
 

 •  UniFirst Corporation

We annually review the peer group to ensure an appropriate mix of companies that are representative of the companies with
which we compete for talent. During fiscal year 2016, we reviewed the composition of the peer group and removed Fair Isaac
Corporation due to the relocation of its headquarters from Minnesota to California.

General Survey Data

We also compare NEO compensation against survey data based on job responsibility, generally using market median data from
companies with comparable revenue. We analyze data from Mercer and Willis Towers Watson to ensure that we have an accurate
representation of the market. While we are able to reliably compare the compensation for Mr. Milroy and Ms. Jokinen against our peer
group, when assessing compensation for other NEOs, we consider a combination of survey data and peer group data. However, we do
not utilize a specific formula to weight the different elements of data considered. We also review plan design, plan features and
participant eligibility as part of our overall compensation analysis process.

Disparity among NEOs

There are no policy differences with respect to the compensation of individual NEOs. The compensation disparity among our
NEOs is due to the fact that we also consider the following key variables in making NEO compensation decisions:
 

 •  size and scope of the position and level of responsibility;
 

 •  experience and capabilities of the NEO;
 

 •  time in current position;
 

 •  the NEO’s performance and potential;
 

 •  internal equity;
 

 •  unique market premiums for key positions; and
 

 •  the NEO’s compensation history.

Relationship among Compensation Elements

In general, each NEO’s compensation at target is weighted more heavily on variable performance-based compensation than on
fixed base compensation. This pay mix supports the role of the NEOs in enhancing shareholder value over the long-term. The variable
pay components at target (annual and long-term incentives) represented more than one-half of the total pay opportunity for all NEOs,
all of which is at risk. Through this mix of pay, performance has a significant effect on the amount of compensation actually received
by NEOs; in making actual individual pay decisions related to performance, the Compensation Committee considers both company
performance and individual NEO performance.

Table of Contents

Because we utilize market data, the specific mix of base pay, short- and long-term incentives varies by NEO. For fiscal year 2016
each NEO’s pay consisted of the following mix:
 

Name   Base Salary  
Short-Term
Incentive   

Long-Term
Incentive  

Douglas A. Milroy    19%   16%   65% 
Tracy C. Jokinen    37%   18%   45% 
Kevin A. Fancey    32%   21%   47% 
Ian G. Davis    37%   18%   45% 
Jeffrey L. Cotter    46%   19%   35% 

Tax Considerations

Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the tax deductibility of compensation in excess of $1 million paid to certain
of our NEOs, unless the compensation constitutes “qualified performance-based compensation,” as defined in this code section. While
the Compensation Committee considers the deductibility of compensation arrangements as an important factor in compensation
decisions for NEOs, deductibility is not the sole factor used in ascertaining appropriate levels or modes of compensation. The MIP
payout for our NEOs is granted under our Restated Equity Incentive Plan (2013) to preserve deductibility of amounts paid.

Our Compensation Program and Risk Management

We design our compensation programs to ensure they do not encourage excessive risk-taking and are compatible with effective
internal controls and risk management practices of the company. We believe the balance between short- and long-term incentives
supports our shareholders’ desire that we deliver results while ensuring financial soundness of our company through various market
cycles. Each August, together with its compensation consultant, our Compensation Committee evaluates the current risk profile of our
executive and broad-based compensation programs. In doing so for fiscal year 2016, our Compensation Committee considered those of
our policies and practices that serve to effectively manage or mitigate risk, including provisions of both our annual and long-term
incentive plans. Specifically, our Compensation Committee continued to rely on our multiple performance measures, discretion in
granting stock awards and use of stock ownership guidelines. Our Compensation Committee also noted our process of internal control
over financial reporting that ensures our performance-based awards are based on accurate data, robust analysis of historical and
anticipated payouts and our enterprise risk management function that assists with managing risk of all kinds. Based on this analysis,
our Compensation Committee concluded that the architecture of our compensation programs, both executive and broad-based, provide
multiple effective safeguards to protect against unnecessary risk-taking, effectively balancing risk and reward in the best interest of our
shareholders.

2015 “Say on Pay” Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation

At our last annual meeting, we provided our shareholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on executive
compensation. At our 2015 shareholders’ meeting, approximately 97% of the votes cast in the “say on pay” advisory vote, excluding
abstentions, were “FOR” approval of our executive compensation. The Compensation Committee evaluated the results of the 2015
advisory vote, together with the other factors and data discussed in this “Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” in determining
executive compensation policies and decisions. The committee considered the vote results and did not make any changes to our
executive compensation policies and decisions as a result of the 2015 advisory vote.

date fair value of Mr. Milroy’s Performance DER was measured based on a $2.15 present value of expected future dividend
payments and assumed Mr. Milroy would achieve 100,000 shares under his Performance Stock Award.

Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal Year 2016

The following table shows the grants of plan-based awards to our NEOs in fiscal year 2016. All awards identified by a grant date
reflect equity awards made under our Restated Equity Incentive Plan (2013). Awards with no grant date reflect awards under our MIP,
provided that our NEOs’ MIP awards are paid through our Restated Equity Incentive Plan (2013). All restricted stock awards to our
NEOs vest in equal increments over a five-year period, beginning with the first anniversary of the date of grant. All restricted stock
units granted to Mr. Fancey vest in equal increments over a three-year period, beginning with the first anniversary of the date of grant,
and are payable in cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of one share of the company’s common stock on the vesting date
multiplied by the number of units that vested, after which vested units are canceled. All grants of options to our NEOs have a ten-year
term and vest in equal increments over a three-year period, beginning with the first anniversary of the date of grant. Holders of
restricted stock (both vested and unvested shares) possess the same rights with respect to those shares, including to receive dividends,
as all other shareholders. Holders of unvested restricted stock units do not possess voting rights, but do possess dividend equivalent
rights on unvested units, whereby on the record date of any dividend payment, the holder will receive

(1) These columns reflect minimum, target, and maximum payouts under our MIP for fiscal year 2016. Mr. Fancey’s target was

converted to USD using an average exchange rate of 0.7553. For an explanation of how the payouts are calculated, see the
“— Elements of our Compensation Program — Plan Measures and Weights and Performance Targets” and “— MIP Calculation
for Fiscal year 2016” discussions above.

(2) As discussed in “— Compensation Discussion and Analysis” and “— Relationship among Compensation Elements — Tax
Considerations” above, subject to the applicable provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, payments to our
NEOs under the MIP are made under the terms of our Restated Equity Incentive Plan (2013).

(3) All stock awards granted to NEOs in fiscal year 2016 were restricted stock awards, except that Mr. Fancey received restricted
stock units. Restricted stock awards are entitled to receive dividends at the same rate as our other outstanding common stock.
Restricted stock units are entitled to receive a cash equivalent dividend payment at the same rate as our other outstanding common
stock.

(4) Each stock option granted to an NEO in fiscal year 2016 represents the right to purchase a share of G&K common stock at a
specified exercise price, subject to the terms and conditions of the option agreement.

(5) The exercise price is the fair market value of G&K common stock on the day the option was granted. Fair market value is set
based on the closing price on the grant date.

(6) This column represents the grant date fair value of each equity award granted during fiscal year 2016, which is calculated in
accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. For information regarding our equity compensation grant practices, see “— Elements of
our Compensation Program — Grant Practice” above.

(1) The option exercise prices for all options awards with grant dates prior to April 27, 2012 reflect a reduction of $6.00 from the

original exercise price, which reduction was made to all outstanding option awards on such date, in order to prevent a special
dividend declared in fiscal year 2012 from diluting or enlarging the rights of the holders of outstanding stock options under our
equity incentive plans. Similarly, the option exercises for all option awards with grant dates prior to June 6, 2014 also reflect a
$6.00 reduction due to the special dividend declared in fiscal year 2014.

(2) For each option shown, the expiration date is the tenth anniversary of the date the option was granted.

Canadian Retirement Arrangements

Mr. Fancey, a Canadian citizen, is covered by a defined contribution plan pursuant to which we contribute 2% of his base salary
and match his contributions of up to 6% of base salary, and pursuant to which he directs investment of the funds. The Canadian
government sets a limit for total contributions, which for calendar year 2016 is $26,010 CAD, to be adjusted for inflation each year. If
this limit is reached, Mr. Fancey is covered by a retirement compensation arrangement, or RCA. Under the RCA, we continue to
contribute an amount equal to 2% of Mr. Fancey’s salary and match Mr. Fancey’s contributions of up to 6% of base pay. One-half of
the money contributed to the RCA is held by a trustee and is invested in widely available mutual funds. The other one-half is held by
the Canadian government as a refundable tax. One-half of all earnings on funds invested by the trustee is also paid to the Canadian
government and is also held as a refundable tax.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation (DEFCO)

Our DEFCO is a non-qualified plan that provides our executives and NEOs with the opportunity to defer up to 25% of base salary
and 50% of incentive compensation. Amounts deferred are credited to an individual’s contribution account and are fully vested at all
times. We credit deferred accounts with additional amounts equal to the value of the matching contributions. We match 50% of a
participant’s deferrals into DEFCO, excluding deferrals in excess of 10% of a participant’s compensation. In addition, we make
company retirement contributions equal to 2.5% of eligible pay and an additional 4% of eligible pay over the IRS compensation limit
($265,000 in calendar year 2016). A participant’s employer contribution account is 100% vested upon attainment of age 60 as an active
employee, or 10% per year for each plan year in which the participant works at least 1,000 hours. Participants may choose among 16
investment measurement funds in which to participate, and participants may change their investment mix at any time. Participants’
deferred cash accounts earn a rate of return which tracks the investment return achieved under the participant-selected investment
measurement funds. Each participant is an unsecured creditor for any benefit he or she will receive under DEFCO, as we have not
created a fund for payment of DEFCO benefits that is protected from creditor claims.

At the time of the initial deferral election, participants must also select a distribution date (no later than age 65) and form of
payment for normal retirement (defined as termination of employment at age 60 or later).

Table of Contents

Participants may elect to receive distributions in a single payment or installments for normal retirement. If a participant’s employment
is terminated before age 60, the participant will receive a lump sum payment of his or her deferral account, and the vested portion of
the employer contribution account is paid three years later in a lump sum, provided that the participant does not compete against our
company or solicit customers or employees of our company, as defined by the non-competition provision of the plan. If the participant
works for the company until at least age 60, neither the non-competition provision nor the three-year delay will apply, and the deferral
account and the employer contribution account will be paid after separation from service according to the election the participant made
consistent with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. At the discretion of the Retirement Committee, the participant may obtain
a hardship distribution from his or her eligible vested account in the event of an unforeseeable emergency. The hardship distribution
will only be allowed if the participant’s financial hardship cannot be cured by simply cancelling the participant’s future contributions.
In the event of a change in control that occurs when the participant is an employee of the company, unless the board and a majority of
the continuing directors of the plan sponsor decide that the change in control should not affect the vested percentages of participants, a
participant’s account will vest.

The following table shows contributions to the NEOs’ deferred compensation accounts in fiscal year 2016 and the aggregate

(4) Amounts reported in this column for each NEO include amounts previously reported in the Fiscal Year 2016 Summary
Compensation Table in previous years when earned if that NEO’s compensation was required to be disclosed in a previous year.
Amounts previously reported in such years include previously earned, but deferred, salary and incentive payments and company
matching contributions. This total reflects the cumulative value of each NEO’s deferrals and matching contributions and
investment experience.

For Mr. Milroy, acceleration of vesting under DEFCO would require acquisition by a third party of 50% of our outstanding stock,
rather than the 30% threshold stated in Mr. Milroy’s employment agreement for receipt of other change in control benefits. Each of the
other NEO’s DEFCO account may become fully vested upon a change in control, as described above.

Potential Post-Employment Payments

Our NEOs are entitled to certain benefits and payments in the event of certain terminations pursuant to our Executive Severance
and Change in Control Policy. Separately, Mr. Milroy’s employment agreement provides him with similar benefits and payments in the
event of certain terminations of his employment agreement. In all cases, post-employment benefits to our NEOs are conditioned upon
the NEO signing a waiver and release of claims against the company and upon the NEO remaining in compliance with the NEO’s non-
competition obligations. All descriptions below of post-employment pay and benefits due to our NEOs are qualified in their entirety by
reference to the Executive Severance and Change in Control Policy and to Mr. Milroy’s employment agreement.

Pursuant to the Merger, the Company has approved a retention program in the aggregate amount of not more than $7.5 million to
promote retention and to incentivize efforts to consummate the closing of the Merger with eligible employees selected at the discretion
of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. The Company has entered into a retention bonus agreement with Mr. Cotter. Payment of
Mr. Cotter’s retention award will be paid in a cash lump sum at the end of the retention period, subject to continued employment
through the retention period (unless earlier terminated without cause). The retention period will end on the earlier of the transaction
closing date or August 15, 2017.

Severance

In all cases, in the event that an NEO’s employment is terminated by us without cause, we must provide to the NEO the following
benefits:
 

 •  we must provide the NEO with 30 days advance written notice of termination;
 

 

•  if the NEO signs and does not revoke a release, we must pay to the NEO, as separation pay, an amount equal to 11 months of
the NEO’s base salary (or, in the case of Mr. Milroy, an amount equal to 1.99 times his annual base salary) in effect as of the
actual date of termination, such separation pay being made in weekly payments, subject to the terms of such release; some
payments may be subject to a delay of six months to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code;

 

 
•  if the NEO (or any individual receiving group health plan benefits through such NEO) is eligible to continue participation in

our group health plan and elects to do so, we will, for a period of up to 11 months (or, in the case of Mr. Milroy, for a period
of up to 17 months) commencing as of the actual

date of termination, continue to pay the employer’s share of the cost of such benefits as if such NEO remained in our
continuous employment, but only while such NEO or such person is not eligible for coverage under any other employer’s
group health plan;

 

 
•  we will, for a period of at least one year commencing as of the actual date of termination, pay directly to the service provider

or reimburse the NEO for all reasonable expenses of a reputable outplacement organization selected by such NEO, such
payments not to exceed $12,000 in the aggregate;

 

 •  we will pay to Mr. Milroy a lump sum payment equal to six times his monthly automobile allowance, if applicable;
 

 
•  we will pay to Mr. Milroy any unpaid management incentive bonus earned by him and to which he is entitled, such payment

being made in accordance with the terms of the related plan; and
 

 •  all unvested shares awarded to Mr. Milroy under his Performance Stock Award will immediately vest.

At the end of this section are tables indicating the estimated incremental amounts we would owe to each of our NEOs upon such
NEO’s termination without cause. No executive is required to seek other employment to receive any post-employment benefits. Any
executive’s commencement of employment with another employer will not reduce our obligations to make severance payments.

In the event an NEO voluntarily resigns or an NEO’s employment is terminated for cause or by reason of death, such executive is
only entitled to his or her base salary through the date of termination or death, plus any other earned but unpaid amounts under any
applicable employment agreement or any benefit plan. Finally, our employment agreement with Mr. Milroy contains an additional
provision requiring him to resign from all positions held with us, including any of our company boards on which he serves as a
director, in the event his employment with us is terminated.

Change in Control

Following is a discussion of the potential payments due to each NEO in the event of a “Change in Control” of the company,
followed by a “Change in Control Termination.” Both our Executive Severance and Change in Control Policy and Mr. Milroy’s
employment agreement address termination due to Change in Control and for “good reason,” and provide as follows:

A “Change in Control” occurs when:
 

 •  anyone attains control of 30% of our voting stock;
 

 •  challengers replace a majority of our board within two years; or
 

 •  we merge or consolidate with, or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to, someone other than the company.

A “Change in Control Termination” occurs when a Change in Control has taken place and the NEO then is terminated within one
year of the Change in Control either by the employer for any reason other than for cause, or by the NEO for good reason. Good reason
is defined to include the following:
 

 •  a substantial adverse involuntary change in the NEO’s status or position as an executive with the company;
 

 •  a material reduction by the company in the NEO’s base salary as in effect on the day before the Change in Control;
 

 •  in the case of Mr. Milroy, any material adverse change in physical working conditions interfering with his work;

Table of Contents

 
•  a requirement to relocate, other than on intermittent basis, more than 35 miles from our corporate headquarters as a condition

of employment;
 

 
•  failure by the company to obtain from any successor an assumption of the Executive Severance and Change in Control

Policy or, in the case of Mr. Milroy, of his employment agreement;
 

 
•  attempted termination other than pursuant to the Executive Severance and Change in Control Policy or, in the case of Mr.

Milroy, his employment agreement; or
 

 •  any material breach of Mr. Milroy’s employment agreement.

In the event of a Change in Control of the company and the related termination of an NEO’s employment by such NEO for good
reason or by us for any reason other than for cause, in each case, prior to the first anniversary of the Change in Control:
 

 •  we must provide the NEO with 30 days advance written notice of termination;
 

 
•  we will pay the NEO an amount equal to 17 months of such NEO’s base salary (or, in the case of Mr. Milroy, an amount

equal to 1.99 times his annual base salary), subject to certain limitations; some payments may be subject to a delay of six
months to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code;

 

 
•  if the NEO (or any individual receiving group health plan benefits through such NEO) is eligible to continue participation in

our group health plan and elects to do so, we must, for a period of up to 17 months, continue to pay the employer’s share of
the cost of such benefits as if such NEO remained in our continuous employment, subject to certain limitations;

 

 
•  we will, for a period of at least one year, pay directly or reimburse such NEO for all reasonable outplacement expenses, such

payments not to exceed $12,000;
 

 
•  we will pay Mr. Milroy the amount necessary to acquire and obtain full title to any personal automobile leased by us for him

or, if Mr. Milroy does not have the use of a personal automobile but has been given an automobile allowance, we will pay
him a lump sum payment equal to three times the annual automobile allowance he is then receiving;

 

 •  we will pay Mr. Milroy up to $7,500 for financial planning and tax preparation expenses for 17 months; and
 

 
•  we will pay to Mr. Milroy any management incentive bonus earned by him and to which he is entitled, such payment being

made in accordance with the terms of the related plan.

In addition, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, and without regard to an NEO’s employment status, but presuming that
the NEO remains in our employ on the date of the Change in Control, the following shall occur with respect to any and all equity-based
incentives that are not performance-based, including, without limitation, stock options and awards of restricted stock or restricted stock
units that are owned by such NEO on the date of the Change in Control:
 

 
•  the restrictions on any previously issued shares of restricted stock other than performance based awards will immediately

lapse;
 

 
•  the restrictions on any previously issued restricted stock units will immediately lapse, and the holder will be entitled to a

cash payment equal to the closing price of G&K common stock on the date of the Change in Control multiplied by the
number of restricted stock units outstanding;

 

 •  all outstanding options and stock appreciation rights will become immediately exercisable; and
 

 •  all performance criteria for all performance shares will be deemed to be met and immediate payment made.

Table of Contents

With respect to Mr. Milroy’s Performance Stock Award, and subject to Mr. Milroy’s continued employment through the date of
any Change in Control, the restricted stock earned under the Performance Stock Award will immediately vest.

If any payments and benefits in connection with a change in control would be a parachute payment under Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code, payments and benefits will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary to provide the NEO with the best
after-tax result. Specifically, the NEO will receive either a reduced amount so that no or a lesser amount of excise tax is imposed under
Internal Revenue Code Section 4999, or the NEO will receive the full amount of the payments and benefits and then be liable for a
higher amount of excise tax.

Disability

Mr. Milroy’s employment agreement also provides that during any period in which any he is “disabled,” he will continue to
receive all base salary, benefits, and other compensation, but only if he is not receiving substantially equivalent benefits under any plan
maintained by us. “Disability” means the unwillingness or inability to perform the essential functions of Mr. Milroy’s position (with or
without reasonable accommodation) for a period of 90 days (consecutive or otherwise) within any period of six consecutive months. If
this occurs, we will issue a Notice of Termination, and if Mr. Milroy has not returned to the full-time performance of his duties within
30 days, the 30th day after Notice of Termination will be his date of termination. With respect to Mr. Milroy’s Performance Stock
Award, if he becomes disabled, all earned shares will immediately vest.

Post-Employment Payment Tables

The tables below provide the estimated amounts that would have been received by each NEO below had there been a termination
under the various scenarios described above as of July 2, 2016, the last day of our most recently completed fiscal year. Although we
have not entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Cotter, Davis or Fancy or Ms. Jokinen, they are entitled to certain
separation benefits pursuant to our Executive Severance and Change in Control Policy. Mr. Milroy is entitled to similar benefits under
his employment agreement. In the tables below, no amounts are included for MIP awards, the vested portion of Mr. Milroy’s
Performance Stock Award or Mr. Milroy’s Performance DER, because no payments or enhanced benefits are triggered by disability or
by a termination or change in control.

VOTE ON RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS (PROPOSAL 5)

Our board and management are committed to the quality, integrity and transparency of the company’s financial statements and
reports. Independent auditors play an important part in our system of financial control. In accordance with the duties set forth in its
written charter, the Audit Committee of the Company Board has appointed KPMG LLP as our independent auditors for the 2017 fiscal
year. A representative of KPMG will attend this year’s annual meeting and will be available to respond to questions from shareholders,
and also will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so.

If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of KPMG, the Audit Committee may reconsider its selection, but is not required
to do so. Notwithstanding the proposed ratification of the appointment of KPMG by shareholders, the Audit Committee, in its
discretion, may direct the appointment of new independent auditors at any time during the year without notice to, or the consent of, the
shareholders, if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in our best interest.

Fees Billed to Company by Auditors

Set forth below are the fees billed by KPMG for the fiscal years ended July 2, 2016 and June 27, 2015:
 

   
Fiscal Year Ended
July 2, 2016 ($)    

Fiscal Year Ended
June 27, 2015 ($)  

Audit Fees(1)    837,000     681,106  
Audit-Related Fees    —       —    
Tax Fees    —       —    
All Other Fees    —       —    
Total    837,000     681,106  

 
(1) Represents amounts related to the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial

reporting and the review of our consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.

The Audit Committee of the Company Board reviews non-audit services as well as the amounts billed for such services to
determine if receipt of these fees by our independent auditors is compatible with the provision of independent audit services. The Audit
Committee also discusses these services and fees with our independent auditor and management to determine that they are appropriate
under applicable rules and regulations. During fiscal year 2016 and 2015, KPMG did not provide any non-audit services. As such, the
foregoing reviews and discussions were not applicable.

Pre-Approval Policy

All services performed by KPMG have been pre-approved in accordance with the Audit Committee charter. The charter provides
that all audit and non-audit accounting services that are permitted to be performed by our independent accountant under applicable
rules and regulations must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee or by designated independent members of the Audit Committee,
other than with respect to de minimis exceptions permitted under Section 202 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Prior to or as soon as
practicable following the beginning of each fiscal year, a description of audit, audit-related, tax and other services expected to be
performed by KPMG in the fiscal year is presented to the Audit Committee for approval. Following such approval, any requests for
audit, audit-related, tax and other services not presented and pre-approved must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific pre-
approval. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings. However, the authority to grant specific pre-approval
between meetings, as necessary, may be delegated to one or more members of the Audit Committee who is/are independent directors.
In the event such authority is so delegated, the Audit Committee must be updated at the next regularly scheduled meeting with respect
to any services that were granted specific pre-approval by delegation. During fiscal year 2016, the Audit Committee functioned in
conformance with these procedures.

Report of the Audit Committee

The Audit Committee has reviewed our audited consolidated financial statements for the last fiscal year, and has discussed them
with management and KPMG. In carrying out its responsibilities, the Audit Committee met with our management periodically during
the year to consider the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures. The Audit Committee has also discussed with KPMG the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (PCAOB) Auditing Standard No. 16 (Communication with Audit Committee).

The Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by the applicable
requirements of the PCAOB regarding KPMG’s communication with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has
discussed with KPMG its independence, including a consideration of the compatibility of non-audit services with such independence.

The Audit Committee, based on the review and discussions described above with management and KPMG, has recommended to
our Board of Directors, which adopted this recommendation, that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2016 for filing with the SEC.

As reported:

The Audit Committee Report set forth above will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or under the Exchange Act, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate such report by

ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (PROPOSAL 6)

In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, our shareholders have the
opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in the “Executive Compensation”
section of this proxy statement. We hold these advisory votes annually.

Our executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified, experienced executives and
reward them for performance that creates long-term shareholder value. We seek to accomplish this goal in a way that rewards
performance and is aligned with our shareholders’ long-term interests. We believe that our executive compensation program, which
employs long-term equity awards, satisfies this goal and is strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders. We urge
our shareholders to read the “Executive Compensation” section of this proxy statement, including the “Executive Compensation —
Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section, which more thoroughly discusses how our compensation policies and procedures
implement our compensation philosophy. Our board and its Compensation Committee believe that these policies and procedures are
effective in achieving our goals, and our board recommends that our shareholders approve the compensation of our NEOs.

We are providing our shareholders with the opportunity to indicate their approval for our executive compensation program for our
NEOs by voting on the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the shareholders of G&K Services, Inc. approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the
company’s named executive officers as disclosed in the “Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section
and in the compensation tables and narrative discussion contained in the “Executive Compensation” section of this proxy statement.”

As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon the company. However, the Compensation Committee, which is
responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by our shareholders in
their vote on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for NEOs.

THE COMPANY BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE ADVISORY VOTE
ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS

Section 302A.471 of the MBCA permits any shareholder of the Company who is entitled to vote on the proposed Merger to
dissent from such action and obtain payment for the fair value of his or her shares of common stock (as determined by the value of his
or her G&K common stock immediately before the closing date). Any shareholder of the Company contemplating an attempt to assert
and exercise dissenters’ rights in connection with the proposed Merger should review carefully the provisions of Sections 302A.471
and 302A.473 of the MBCA (copies of which are provided as Annex C), particularly the specific procedural steps required to perfect
such rights. DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS ARE LOST IF THE PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 302A.473 OF THE
MBCA ARE NOT FULLY AND PRECISELY SATISFIED.

Set forth below (to be read in conjunction with the full text of Section 302A.473 of the MBCA appearing in Annex C) is a brief
description of the procedures relating to the exercise of dissenters’ rights applicable to the proposed Merger. The following description
does not purport to be a complete statement of the provisions of Section 302A.473 of the MBCA and is qualified in its entirety by
reference thereto.

Under Section 302A.473, Subd. 3 of the MBCA, a shareholder who wishes to exercise dissenters’ rights as a dissenting
shareholder must file with the Company, before the shareholder vote on the proposed Merger, a written notice of intent to demand the
fair value of the Company’s shares owned by the shareholder. Under Section 302A.471, Subd. 2 of the MBCA, beneficial owners of
shares who desire to exercise statutory dissenters’ rights must obtain and submit the registered owner’s written consent at or before the
time the notice of intent to demand fair value is due. IN ADDITION, THE SHAREHOLDER MUST NOT VOTE HIS OR HER
SHARES IN FAVOR OF THE PROPOSED MERGER. A VOTE AGAINST THE PROPOSED MERGER DOES NOT IN ITSELF
CONSTITUTE SUCH A WRITTEN NOTICE AND A FAILURE TO VOTE DOES NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF A TIMELY
WRITTEN NOTICE.

If the proposed Merger is approved by the shareholders of the Company, then the Company must send to all dissenting
shareholders who filed the necessary notice of intent to demand the fair value of their shares (and who did not vote their shares in favor
of such proposal) a notice containing certain information required by Section 302A.473, Subd. 4 of the MBCA, including without
limitation the address to which a dissenting shareholder must send a demand for payment and certificates representing certificated
shares in order to obtain payment for such shares and the date by which they must be received, and in the case of uncertificated shares
any restrictions on transfer of uncertificated shares that will apply after a demand for payment is received. In order to receive the fair
value of the shares under Section 302A.473 of the MBCA, a dissenting shareholder must demand payment and deposit certificates
representing certificated shares or comply with any restrictions on transfer of uncertificated shares within 30 days after such notice
from the Company is given. Under Minnesota law, notice by mail is given by a corporation when deposited in the United States mail. A
SHAREHOLDER WHO FAILS TO MAKE DEMAND FOR PAYMENT AND TO DEPOSIT CERTIFICATES AS REQUIRED BY
SECTION 302A.473, SUBD. 4 OF THE MBCA, LOSES THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE FAIR VALUE OF HIS OR HER SHARES
UNDER SUCH SECTION NOTWITHSTANDING THE TIMELY FILING OF NOTICE OF INTENT TO DEMAND PAYMENT
UNDER SECTION 302A.473, SUBD. 3 OF THE MBCA.

Except as provided below, if demand for payment and deposit of stock certificates is duly made by a dissenting shareholder with
the Company as required by the MBCA, then after the Company’s receipt of such demand or the closing date, whichever is later, the
Company must pay the dissenting shareholder an amount which the Company estimates to be the fair value of the dissenting
shareholder’s shares of stock, with interest, if any. For the purpose of a dissenting shareholder’s appraisal rights under Sections
302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA, “fair value” means the value of the shares of stock immediately before the closing date and
“interest” means interest commencing five days after the closing date until the date of payment, calculated at the rate provided in
Minnesota Statutes Section 549.09, which is currently 4%. If a dissenting shareholder believes the payment received from the
Company is less than the fair value of the shares of stock, with interest, if any, such dissenting shareholder must give written notice to
the Company of his or her own estimate of the fair value of the

Table of Contents

shares of stock, with interest, if any, within 30 days after the date the Company mails the remittance, and must demand payment of the
difference between his or her estimate and the Company’s remittance. If such dissenting shareholder fails to give written notice of such
estimate to the Company, or fails to demand payment of the difference, within the 30-day time period, such dissenting shareholder is
entitled only to the amount remitted by the Company.

The Company may withhold such remittance with respect to shares of stock for which a dissenting shareholder demanding
payment (or persons on whose behalf such dissenting shareholder acts) was not the beneficial owner as of August 16, 2016. As to each
such dissenting shareholder who has validly demanded payment, following the closing date or the receipt of demand, whichever is
later, the Company must mail its estimate of the fair value of such dissenting shareholder’s shares of stock and offer to pay this amount
with interest, if any, to the dissenting shareholder upon receipt of such dissenting shareholder’s agreement to accept this amount in full
satisfaction. If such dissenting shareholder believes that the Company’s offer is for less than the fair value of the shares of stock, with
interest, if any, such dissenting shareholder must give written notice to the Company of his or her own estimate of the fair value of the
shares of stock, with interest, if any, and demand payment of this amount. This demand must be mailed to the Company within 30 days
after the mailing of the Company’s offer. If the dissenting shareholder fails to make this demand within the 30-day time period, such
dissenting shareholder is entitled only to the amount offered by the Company.

If the Company and a dissenting shareholder (including both a dissenting shareholder who purchased shares of stock on or prior
to August 16, 2016, which was the date the Merger was publicly announced, and a dissenting shareholder who purchased shares of
stock after such date who have complied with their respective demand requirements) do not settle the dissenting shareholder’s demand
within 60 days after the Company receives the dissenting shareholder’s estimate of the fair value of his or her shares of stock, then the
Company must file a petition in a court of competent jurisdiction in Hennepin County, requesting that the court determine the statutory
fair value of stock with interest, if any. All dissenting shareholders whose demands are not settled within the applicable 60-day
settlement period must be made parties to this proceeding.

The court will then determine whether each dissenting shareholder in question has fully complied with the provisions of Section
302A.473 of the MBCA, and for all dissenting shareholders who have fully complied and not forfeited statutory dissenters’ rights, will
determine the fair value of the shares, taking into account any and all factors the court finds relevant (including, without limitation, the
recommendation of any appraisers which may have been appointed by the court), computed by any method that the court, in its
discretion, sees fit to use, whether or not used by the Company or a dissenting shareholder. The fair value of the shares as determined
by the court is binding on all shareholders. However, under the MBCA, dissenting shareholders are not liable to the Company for the
amount, if any, by which payments remitted to the dissenting shareholders exceed the fair value of such shares determined by a court,
with interest. The costs and expenses of such a court proceeding are assessed against the Company, except that the court may assess
part or all of those costs and expenses against a dissenting shareholder whose action in demanding payment is found to be arbitrary,
vexatious or not in good faith.

Under Section 302A.471, Subd. 2 of the MBCA, a shareholder of the Company may not assert dissenters’ rights with respect to
less than all of the shares of stock registered in such shareholder’s name, unless the shareholder is dissenting with respect to all shares
beneficially owned by another person and discloses the name and address of such other person.

Under Section 302A.471, Subd. 4 of the MBCA, a shareholder of the Company has no right at law or in equity to have the merger
agreement set aside or rescinded, except if approval or consummation of such merger agreement is fraudulent with respect to such
shareholder or the Company.

In view of the complexity of Section 302A.471 of the MBCA, the Company’s shareholders who may wish to pursue dissenters’
rights should consult their legal and financial advisors.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Code of Business Conduct and Ethics

We have adopted a Code of Conduct for our board, a Code of Ethical Conduct for our employees, officers and directors generally,
and a Code of Ethical Conduct for Senior Executives and Financial Managers. The latter of these codes, as applied to our principal
executive officer, principal financial officer and controller, constitutes our “code of ethics” within the meaning of Section 406 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These codes are posted on our website at http://www.gkservices.com. We will promptly disclose on our website
amendments to provisions of these codes, and any waivers of provisions of these codes required to be disclosed under the rules of the
SEC or the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

Certain Transactions

Our board reviews and approves any transactions between our company or any of its subsidiaries and related parties in which the
related person has or will have a material direct or indirect interest. Our board’s related review and approval policies are not in writing,
but in conducting such reviews and approving such transactions, among other things, our board considers the type of transaction
proposed, appropriate regulatory requirements, the monetary value of the transaction, the nature of the goods and/or services involved
and whether the transaction may influence the related person’s ability to exercise independent business judgment when conducting the
company’s business and affairs.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class
of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
Officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a)
forms they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms furnished to the company, or written representations that no
Forms 5 were required, we believe that during fiscal year 2016, our officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners
complied with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements, with the exception of one report filed late by Mr. Davis to report an
automatic withholding of shares to cover taxes due following a vesting of restricted stock.

Ability of Shareholders to Communicate with the Company Board

We have established means for shareholders and others to communicate with our board. If a shareholder wishes to address a
matter regarding our financial statements, accounting practices or internal controls, the matter should be submitted in writing addressed
to the Chair of the Audit Committee in care of our Corporate Secretary at our headquarters address. If the matter relates to our
governance practices, business ethics or corporate conduct, it should be submitted in writing addressed to the Chair of the Corporate
Governance Committee in care of our Corporate Secretary at our headquarters address. If the matter relates to our compensation
practices, it should be submitted in writing addressed to the Chair of the Compensation Committee in care of our Corporate Secretary
at our headquarters address. If a shareholder is unsure where to direct a communication, the shareholder may direct it in writing to the
Chairman of the Company Board, or to any one of the independent directors of the company, in care of our Corporate Secretary at our
headquarters address. As appropriate, these shareholder communications will be forwarded by our Corporate Secretary to the
appropriate addressee.

Proposals of Shareholders for the 2017 Annual Meeting

If the Merger is completed, we will not hold an annual meeting of shareholders in 2017. If the Merger is not completed, you will
continue to be entitled to attend and participate in our annual meetings of shareholders. If any such annual meeting is held, shareholder
proposals will be eligible for consideration for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy for such annual meeting of
shareholders in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and the Company’s bylaws.

Table of Contents

Under the rules of the SEC, if a shareholder wants us to include a proposal in our proxy statement and form of proxy for
presentation at our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, the proposal must be received by us at our principal executive offices at 5995
Opus Parkway, Suite 500, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343 not less than 120 calendar days before the date of our proxy statement for the
2016 annual meeting, which would be June 5, 2017. The proposal must satisfy the requirements of SEC Rule 14a-8, including by
providing proof of ownership of our stock and should be sent to the attention of our Corporate Secretary. Submitting a shareholder
proposal does not guarantee that we will include it in our proxy statement.

Under our Amended and Restated Bylaws, certain procedures are provided that a shareholder must follow to nominate persons for
election as directors or to introduce an item of business at an annual meeting of shareholders. These procedures provide that
nominations for director nominees and/or an item of business to be introduced at an annual meeting of shareholders must be submitted
in writing, together with certain specified information relating to such shareholder’s stock ownership, identity and other matters, to our
Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices. We must receive the notice of your intention to introduce a nomination or to
propose an item of business at our 2017 annual meeting:
 

 
•  if the 2017 annual meeting is being held within 30 days before or 60 days after the anniversary of the date of this year’s

annual meeting (November 15, 2016), we must receive notice not less than 120 days in advance of the first anniversary of
the 2016 annual meeting; or

 

 
•  120 days in advance of the annual meeting or, if later, ten days following the first public announcement of the date of such

annual meeting of shareholders.

Our fiscal year 2017 annual meeting of shareholders is tentatively scheduled to be held on November 7, 2017. Assuming that our
2017 annual meeting is held on schedule, we must receive notice of your intention to introduce a nomination or other item of business
at that meeting no later than July 18, 2017. If we do not receive notice prior to such date, or if we meet certain other requirements of
applicable SEC rules, the persons named as proxies in the proxy materials relating to that meeting will use their discretion in voting the
proxies when any such matters are raised at the meeting.

A shareholder’s nomination for director must contain the following information about the nominee (among other information, as
specified in our Amended and Restated Bylaws):
 

 •  name;
 

 
•  all information relating to the nominee that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in

an election contest or that is otherwise required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act; and
 

 •  such person’s signed written consent to being a nominee and to serving as a director if elected.

A shareholders’ notice of a proposed item of business must include (among other information, as specified in our Amended and
Restated Bylaws):
 

 
•  a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at

the meeting;
 

 
•  the name and address, as they appear on the company’s books, of the shareholder proposing such business and the name and

address of any beneficial owner on whose behalf the proposal is made;
 

 
•  the information required by Section 16(b)(y)(ii) of the rules of the Exchange Act, with respect to such shareholder and any

such beneficial owner;
 

 •  any material interest the shareholder has in such business; and
 

 
•  a representation and other appropriate evidence that the shareholder is a holder of record of shares of stock entitled to vote

on such business at the meeting, will continue to be a holder of record of such shares of stock, and intends to appear in
person or by proxy at the meeting to make the proposal.

Table of Contents

As set forth in our Amended and Restated Bylaws, a shareholder’s notice, whether to nominate a director or to introduce an item
of business at an annual meeting, must also contain specified information regarding the shareholder and any beneficial owner on whose
behalf the proposal is made. Due to the complexity of the respective rights of the shareholders and the company under Rule 14a-8 and
the advance notice provisions of our Amended and Restated Bylaws, any shareholder desiring to propose such an action is advised to
consult with his or her legal counsel with respect to such rights. We suggest that any such proposal be submitted to us by certified mail,
return receipt requested.

Discretionary Proxy Voting Authority/ Untimely Shareholder Proposals

Rule 14a-4 promulgated under the Exchange Act, governs our use of our discretionary proxy voting authority with respect to a
shareholder proposal that the shareholder has not sought to include in our proxy statement. As set forth above, shareholders must
comply with the advance notice procedure in our Amended and Restated Bylaws if they are to submit a proposal for consideration at
our annual meeting. We do not intend to entertain any proposals or nominations at the annual meeting that do not meet the
requirements set forth in our Amended and Restated Bylaws. If the shareholder does not also comply with the requirements of Rule
14a-4(c)(2) under the Exchange Act, we may exercise discretionary voting authority under proxies that we solicit to vote in accordance
with our best judgment on any such shareholder proposal or nomination.

Shareholders Sharing an Address

Shareholders sharing an address with another shareholder may receive only one copy of our annual report and proxy materials at
that address unless they have provided contrary instructions. Any such shareholder who wishes to receive a separate annual report or
set of proxy materials now or in the future may write us to request a separate copy of these materials from Investor Relations, G&K

shareholder sharing an address with another shareholder can request delivery of a single copy of annual reports or proxy statements if
they are receiving multiple copies of annual reports or proxy statements by contacting us as set forth above.

statements, schedules and list of exhibits, and any exhibit specifically requested, will be furnished without charge to any shareholder

ARTICLE III

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;
Exchange of Certificates

3.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holder of any capital stock of the Company:

(a) Merger Consideration. Each share of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.50 per share, of the Company (each, a
“Share” or, collectively, the “Shares”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the “Cancelled Shares”), and (ii) Shares that are owned by
shareholders (“Dissenting Shareholders”) that have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Sections
302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA (“Dissenting Shares” and, together with the Cancelled Shares, the “Excluded Shares”)) will be
converted into the right to receive $97.50 per Share (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares
will cease to be outstanding, will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and each certificate (a “Certificate”) formerly representing any of
the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and any Shares (other than Excluded Shares) held in book-entry form (“Book-Entry Shares”)
will thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest.

(b) Cancellation of Excluded Shares. Each Excluded Share will cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of
any consideration therefor and will cease to exist, subject to the right of the Record Holder of any Dissenting Share to receive any
payment under Section 3.2(g).

(c) Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

3.2 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will make available or cause to be made available to a paying
agent selected by Parent with the Company’s prior approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (the “Paying Agent”),
amounts in immediately available cash sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make
payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange
Fund”). Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Paying Agent will invest the Exchange
Fund as directed by Parent; provided, that (i) such investments shall be an obligation of, or guaranteed by, the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers’ acceptances of commercial banks and
(ii) no such investment (or losses thereon) shall affect the amount of Per Share Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Shares
pursuant to Section 3.1(a). To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for
other reasons below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Per Share Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(a), Parent will promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such
investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash
payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment will become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under Section 3.1(a) will be promptly returned to Parent. No later than five Business Days prior to the
Closing, Parent shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company
(which confirmation of satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to effect the applicable terms of this
Agreement.

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business Days thereafter),
Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Record Holder of Shares represented by Certificates (other than with respect to
Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in
Section 3.2(f)) to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 3.2(f)), in exchange for the amount to which such Record Holder is entitled as a result of the Merger
pursuant to Section 3.1(a). Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal by any Record Holder of Shares (other than with respect to
Excluded Shares), duly completed and duly executed in accordance with its instructions, and such other documents as the Paying
Agent or Parent may reasonably require, and the surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented such Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.2(f)), such Record Holder will be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a cash amount by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by such
Record Holder (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.2(h)) equal to the product of (x) the number of Shares
formerly represented by such Certificate (or subject to such affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.2(f)) and (y) the Per
Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled, without payment or accrual of any
interest. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any
cash to be delivered upon compliance with the procedures described above may be issued to the transferee if the applicable letter of
transmittal is accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

Table of Contents

(c) Book-Entry Shares. No holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Article III. In lieu thereof and subject to the following sentence, each registered holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Shares represented by such holder’s Book-Entry Shares that were
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as a result of the Merger pursuant to Section 3.1(a) by (y) the
Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be cancelled, without payment or accrual of any
interest. The Paying Agent shall accept such Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices.

(d) Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of
any Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it will be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder of the Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article III.

(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the
Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed 180 calendar days after the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation. Any Record Holder (other than with respect to Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article III
will thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.2(h)), without any interest thereon, (i) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.2(f)) or with respect to Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence with this Section
3.2 and (ii) upon delivery of a letter of transmittal in customary form that is provided promptly to such Record Holder by the Surviving
Corporation, if applicable, and such other documents as reasonably required, in each case, to the Surviving
Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person will be
liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate will have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by
such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 3.2(h)) equal to the number of Shares represented by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(g) Appraisal Rights. Each Dissenting Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Dissenting
Shareholder who has not voted in favor of the Plan of Merger and who has properly demanded appraisal for its Shares in accordance
with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA and who has otherwise complied with all applicable provisions of Sections
302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but the
Dissenting Shareholder of such Dissenting Share shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Sections 302A.471 and
302A.473 of the MBCA, unless such Dissenting Shareholder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal under
Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA. If, either before or after the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shareholder fails to
perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal under Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA, each Share held by that
Dissenting Shareholder shall no longer be considered Dissenting Shares and shall thereupon be deemed to automatically be converted
into, and to have become exchanged for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 3.1(a). The Company shall give Parent prompt notice (and in any event within two Business Days)

of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make
any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

(h) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and Paying Agent and their Affiliates will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts payable to any person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts (i) will be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

(i) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of the Shares for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

3.3 Treatment of Stock Plans.

(a) Company Options. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of an option to purchase Shares granted under the Stock Plans (each, a
“Company Option”) (i) the vesting of each Company Option that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be accelerated in full immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) each Company Option that remains outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time and (iii) each holder of each such
Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to be paid an amount in cash (without interest)
equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares previously subject to such Company Option and (y) the excess, if any, of the Per
Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Company Option, less any required withholding Taxes (the
“Option Cash Payment”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Company Option granted after calendar year 2016, to the
extent the terms of such Company Option provide for such Company Option to become vested on a pro-rata basis upon the Closing and
for the remaining unvested portion of such Company Option to become automatically forfeited upon the Closing, such Company
Option will not become vested by reason of clause (i) in the preceding sentence and no Option Cash Payment will be made with respect
to the portion of such Company Option that is automatically forfeited upon the Closing in accordance with the terms of such Company
Option. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Option Cash Payments promptly following the Effective Time. Any
Company Option with an exercise price equal to, or in excess of, the Per Share Merger Consideration will be cancelled at the Effective
Time for no consideration.

(b) Restricted Stock. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of an award of restricted Shares granted under the Stock Plans (“Restricted
Stock”), each award of Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become vested, subject to the
conditions set forth in (i) below, if such conditions are applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time and no longer subject to
restrictions, (i) in the case of Restricted Stock subject to performance-based vesting conditions that have not been satisfied, if any, with
respect to the number of shares of Restricted Stock determined as if the applicable performance goals had been achieved at the target
level of performance at the end of the applicable performance period, and (ii) in the case of Restricted Stock not or no longer subject to
performance-based vesting conditions, with respect to the total number of shares of such Restricted Stock, and in either case such
vested and unrestricted Shares shall be treated as described in Section 3.1(a) of this Agreement, except that the Per Share Merger
Consideration paid to the holder shall be reduced by any required withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to
any Restricted Stock granted after calendar year 2016, to the extent the terms of such Restricted Stock provide

for such Restricted Stock to become vested on a pro-rata basis upon the Closing and for the remaining unvested portion of such
Restricted Stock to become automatically forfeited upon the Closing, such Restricted Stock will not become vested by reason the
preceding sentence and the portion of such Restricted Stock automatically forfeited upon the Closing in accordance with the terms of
such Restricted Stock will be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration. Promptly following the Effective Time, any cash
dividends previously paid by the Company with respect to Restricted Stock and held as of the Effective Time by the Company or its
designated agent shall be distributed by the Company to the holder of such Restricted Stock, to the extent such Restricted Stock has
become vested at the Effective Time in accordance with this Section 3.3(b). Restricted Stock that remains unvested and subject to
restrictions at the Effective Time (after giving effect to this Section 3.3(b)), and any cash dividends previously paid by the Company
with respect to such Restricted Stock, shall be forfeited and the holders of such Restricted Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto.

(c) Other Awards. Each award of a right under any Stock Plan (other than awards of Company Options or Restricted Stock,
the treatment of which is specified in Sections 3.3(a) and 3.3(b), respectively) entitling the holder thereof to Shares or cash equal to or
based on the value of Shares (a “Share Unit”) that is outstanding or payable as of the Effective Time shall be cancelled and terminated
as of the Effective Time and each Share Unit holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to be paid an
amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product of (i) (A) in the case of Share Units subject to performance-based vesting
conditions that have not been satisfied immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, the number of Shares determined as if the
applicable performance goals had been achieved at the target level of performance at the end of the applicable performance period and
(B) in the case of Share Units not or no longer subject to performance-based vesting conditions, the total number of Shares underlying
such Share Units, and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes (the “Share Unit Payment”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Share Unit granted after calendar year 2016, to the extent the terms of such Share
Unit provide for such Share Unit to become vested on a pro-rata basis upon the Closing and for the remaining unvested portion of such
Share Unit to become automatically forfeited upon the Closing, no Share Unit Payment will be made with respect to the portion of such
Share Unit that is automatically forfeited upon the Closing in accordance with the terms of such Share Unit. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay the Share Unit Payments promptly following the Effective Time. In the event that such Share Unit
Payment would cause any additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code with respect to a Share Unit, the
payment shall instead be made in accordance with the terms of the applicable Stock Plan and related award or other governing
document and at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such Share Unit that will not result in a Tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code.

(d) Corporate Actions. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the board of directors of the Company and the
compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company, as applicable, will adopt any resolutions and take any actions which
are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Sections 3.3(a), 3.3(b) and 3.3(c) and to endorse the directors of Merger Sub as the
directors of the Surviving Corporation for purposes of any applicable change of control provision in any Benefit Plan. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company will take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in
settlement of Company Options, Restricted Stock or Share Units.

(e) Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company shall take all actions necessary such that (i) the then current offering
period (and payroll deductions) under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Company ESPP”) shall terminate at least 30
days prior to the Effective Time, (ii) participant accounts are applied in accordance with the Company ESPP to purchase Shares
immediately following the termination of such final offering period (and payroll deductions), and (iii) the Company ESPP terminates
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Any Shares so purchased shall be treated in accordance with Section 3.1(a). All amounts
withheld by the Company on behalf of the participants in the Company ESPP that have not been used to purchase Shares prior to the
termination of the Company ESPP will be returned to the participants without interest pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP
upon the termination of the Company ESPP.

3.4 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. If the Company changes the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction,
the Per Share Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and, as so adjusted, will, from and after the date
of such event, be the Per Share Merger Consideration.

ARTICLE IV

Representations and Warranties

Except as set forth in the Company Reports filed with the SEC since June 28, 2014, that are publicly available prior to the
date of this Agreement (excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factors section, the “Forward-Looking Statements”
section or any other section to the extent they are forward-looking statements or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature of
any such Company Reports) or in the corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter in agreed form delivered to Parent
by the Company contemporaneously with this Agreement (the “Company Disclosure Letter”) (it being agreed that disclosure of any
item in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter will be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter only to the extent that the relevance of such item to such section or subsection is
reasonably apparent on its face), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each of the
Company’s Subsidiaries (other than its Significant Subsidiaries) is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership,
leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has made
available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Company’s and its Significant Subsidiaries’ certificates of incorporation
and bylaws or comparable governing documents, each as amended to the date of this Agreement, and each as so delivered is in full
force and effect, and the Company and such Subsidiaries are each not in violation (other than immaterial violations) of any of their
respective provisions.

4.2 Capital Structure.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 400,000,000 Shares and 30,000,000 shares of Class B Common
Stock, $0.50 per value per share (the “Class B Shares”). As of the close of business on August 12, 2016, 19,681,478 Shares were
outstanding and zero Class B Shares were outstanding. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and are validly issued,

grant, number of Shares and, where applicable, the exercise price. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of
each of the Company’s Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of all Liens. Except as set forth above or in Section 4.2(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that
obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to
subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such
rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such
Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of all Liens. The Company does not have
outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders of the Company on any matter.

(b) Section 4.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (x) each of the Company’s Subsidiaries and the ownership
interest of the Company in each such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any other Person or Persons in each such
Subsidiary and (y) the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ capital stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership interest in any

Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their representatives and any government agency or regulatory body within three years of the date

each Benefit Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) has been maintained, operated, and administered in compliance with its terms and
any related documents or agreements and in compliance with all applicable Laws. There have been no prohibited transactions or
breaches of any of the duties imposed on “fiduciaries” (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the
Benefit Plans (other than Multiemployer Plans) that could result in any liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed

Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(d) Each Benefit Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so
qualified and has been determined by the IRS to be so qualified, or may rely on an opinion letter from the IRS with respect to such
qualification, and each trust created thereunder has been determined by the IRS to be exempt from Tax under the provisions of
Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of any such determination that

Affiliate. No “reportable event” within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the 30-day notice
requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred in the preceding six years with respect to
any Benefit Plan or will be required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Benefit Plan is,

Affiliate pursuant to Section 436 of the Code. Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, there has been no material
change in the financial condition, whether or not as a result of a change in funding method, of such Pension Plan since the valuation
date used for the most recent actuarial valuation report delivered or made available to Parent. With respect to any Multiemployer Plan
contributed to by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate, (i) none of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any
ERISA Affiliate has incurred any withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA or the applicable Laws of a jurisdiction outside of the
United States which remains unsatisfied, and (ii) a complete withdrawal from all such Multiemployer Plans at the Effective Time
would not result in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, accurate and complete copy of the fully executed debt commitment letter,
dated as of August 15, 2016 (together with all annexes, schedules and exhibits thereto) from the banks named therein to Parent
(collectively, the “Debt Financing Commitment Letter”), pursuant to the terms, but subject to the conditions, of which the lender
parties thereto have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub with debt financing in the amounts set forth therein for purposes of,
among other things, financing the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, paying related fees and expenses
(such debt financing, as it may be modified (to the extent permitted by this Agreement), the “Debt Financing”). The Debt Financing
Commitment Letter has not been amended, modified or waived in any manner prior to the date of this Agreement and, as of the date of
this Agreement, no such amendment, modification or waiver is pending or contemplated. As of the date of this Agreement, neither
Parent nor its Subsidiaries has entered into any side letter or other agreement relating to the funding of the Debt Financing, other than
as set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and the fee letters related thereto and there are no arrangements related to the
Debt Financing that would be reasonably be expected to affect the availability of the Debt Financing. The proceeds of the Debt
Financing (both before and after giving effect to the exercise of any or all “market flex” provisions related thereto), together with cash
on hand and each long-term debt financing that replaces all or a portion of the Debt Financing (each such debt financing, each of which
shall have conditions to the availability and funding of the proceeds thereof that are no more restrictive, taken as a whole, than the
Financing Conditions (as defined below), a “Replacement Financing”, and collectively, the “Replacement Financings”), will be
sufficient for the payment of the Merger Amount when due on the Closing. As of the date of this Agreement, the commitments
contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. As of the date of
this Agreement, the Debt Financing Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and represents a valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto, to provide the financing contemplated thereby subject
only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 1 of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter (the
“Financing Conditions”) and subject to the Enforceability Exception. Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all
commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt
Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent, or to the Knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, under the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter, which breach or default would reasonably be expected to result in the inability of Parent to satisfy (or materially
delay the ability of Parent to satisfy) any of the Financing Conditions on or prior to the Closing Date. As of the date of this Agreement,
Parent has no reason to believe that it or any other party thereto will be unable to satisfy the Financing Conditions at or prior to the
time contemplated hereunder for the Closing. Parent understands and acknowledges that under the terms of this Agreement, Parent’s
obligation thereunder is not in any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to Parent’s consummation of any financing arrangements,
Parent’s obtaining of any financing or the availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing to Parent.

(b) The Debt Financing, when funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, together with cash on hand and the
proceeds of the Replacement Financings, if any, will provide Parent with financing on the Closing Date that is sufficient for (i) the
payment of the aggregate consideration payable by Parent on the Closing Date pursuant to Article III hereof and (ii) the payment of all
costs, fees and expenses required to be borne by Parent and its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement on the Closing Date.

5.7 Ownership of Company Common Stock. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or has been at any time during the
period commencing four years prior to the date hereof (i) an “interested shareholder” of the Company, as such term is defined in
Section 302A.673 of the MBCA or (ii) a “Related Person” as such term is defined in the Company’s articles of incorporation.

5.8 No Other Representations. Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article IV, each of Parent and Merger
Sub agrees and acknowledges that neither the Company nor any Person on behalf of the

6.2 Acquisition Proposals.

(a) No Solicitation. The Company agrees that, except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries will, and that it will direct its and its Subsidiaries’ employees,
investment bankers, lenders, attorneys, accountants, agents and other advisors or representatives (such directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, lenders, attorneys, accountants, agents and other advisors or representatives, collectively, “Representatives”) not
to, directly or indirectly:

(i) initiate, solicit, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public
information to any third party relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, except to notify such third party of the existence of this
Section 6.2;

(iii) enter into any letter of intent or similar document, or any agreement or commitment, providing for any Acquisition
Proposal; or

(iv) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or confidentiality agreement in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that if the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that it would be inconsistent with the Company’s directors’ fiduciary obligations
under applicable Law not to do so, the Company may waive any standstill or similar provisions in any agreement to which it
is a party to the extent necessary to permit a person to make, on a confidential basis to the board of directors of the
Company, an Acquisition Proposal.

Without limiting the foregoing, the parties agree that any breach of the foregoing by the Representatives of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, in each case, acting by or on behalf of the Company, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.2 by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote
is obtained, if the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.2 and which the
board of directors of the Company determines in good faith to be bona fide, the Company and its Representatives may (A) provide
information to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal, but only if the Company receives from the Person so requesting such
information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less restrictive to the other party than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (excluding any standstill provision), in which case any standstill provision applicable to Parent and
Merger Sub shall become of no further force or effect, and, to the extent such information has not been previously made available to
Parent, promptly makes available to Parent any information the Company discloses to such Person or its Representatives; (B) engage
or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person and its Representatives; and (C) after having complied with
Section 6.2(c), approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly
or otherwise) such Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any action described in clause (A), (B) or (C)
above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to take
such action, in light of the Acquisition Proposal and the terms of this Agreement, would be inconsistent with the Company’s directors’
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (y) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the board of directors of the
Company has determined in good faith based on the information then available and after consultation with outside legal counsel and
financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior
Proposal, and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C) above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

(c) No Change of Recommendation. Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, neither the board of directors of the
Company nor any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (i) (A) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly
propose or announce its intention to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in each case in any manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation, (B) approve or recommend to the shareholders of the Company, or publicly propose or announce its
intention to approve or recommend to the shareholders of the Company, an Acquisition Proposal or (C) following the public
announcement of an Acquisition Proposal, fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten Business Days (or if the
Shareholders Meeting is to occur prior to the tenth Business Day, such period ending on the Business Day prior to the Shareholders
Meeting) after Parent so requests in writing; provided, that such reaffirmation may indicate, if applicable and in addition to the
reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation, that the board of directors of the Company continues to evaluate such Acquisition
Proposal in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement; provided, further, that Parent shall only be entitled to make one such
request with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and one request with respect to each material amendment, modification or change
thereto (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a “Change of Recommendation”); or (ii) authorize, cause or permit
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, joint venture agreement or other similar agreement with respect to, or that is intended or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with
Section 6.2(b)). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the board of directors of the Company may make a Change of
Recommendation if (1) such action is taken in response to an Intervening Event and (2) prior to taking such action, the board of
directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the Company’s directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that prior to making
such Change of Recommendation, (x) the Company has given Parent at least four Business Days prior written notice of its intention to
take such action, and has provided a description of the Intervening Event, and (y) upon the end of such notice period, the board of
directors of the Company shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent (to the extent Parent proposes any revisions to the Company), and shall have determined, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company’s
directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the board of directors of the
Company may, in response to any Acquisition Proposal that was not the result of a breach of this Section 6.2, make a Change of
Recommendation and/or take the actions specified in Section 8.3(a) if the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company’s directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that
the Company will not make a Change of Recommendation and/or take any action pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a Superior
Proposal unless: (x) the Company notifies Parent in writing, four Business Days in advance, that it intends to take action pursuant to
Section 8.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice will specify the identity of the party who made such Superior Proposal
and the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and attach the most current version of the agreement reflecting such
terms and conditions; and (y) after providing such notice and prior to making a Change of Recommendation and/or taking any action
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company will negotiate in good faith with Parent during such four
Business Day period (to the extent that Parent indicates to the Company that Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to, and will
consider in good faith, any changes to this Agreement agreed to be made in writing by Parent so that such Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal; provided, that in the event that the financial or material terms of such Acquisition Proposal is thereafter
modified by the party making such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will provide written notice of such modified Acquisition
Proposal and will again comply with this Section 6.2(c), except that the deadline for such new written notice will be reduced to three
Business Days (rather than the four Business Days otherwise contemplated by this Section 6.2(c).

(d) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to prohibit the Company from
complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 6.2 shall permit the Company to effect a Change of Recommendation (including compliance with
its disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal) without complying with
Section 6.2(c) and, for the avoidance of doubt, any such disclosure that does not reaffirm the Company Recommendation (other than a
“stop, look and listen” communication by the board of directors of the Company to the Company’s shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-
9(f) of the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and Parent will have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in Section 8.4(a).

(e) Existing Discussions. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company
also agrees that as soon as reasonably practicable it will request each Person that has within the twelve months prior to the date hereof
executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with such Person’s consideration of an acquisition of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives.

(f) Notice. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 48 hours) notify Parent if any proposals or
offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information with respect to an Acquisition Proposal is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with,
it or any of its Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person making the proposal or offer and
the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed Contracts) and thereafter will keep Parent promptly informed of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations. In the event that any party modifies the financial or other material terms of its Acquisition Proposal, the Company will
notify Parent orally and in writing within 48 hours of receipt of such modification of the fact that such Acquisition Proposal has been
modified and the terms of such modification (including, if applicable, copies of any written documentation reflecting such
modification). The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter any confidentiality (or similar) agreement subsequent to
the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing to Parent such material terms and conditions. The Company will
promptly (and in any event within 48 hours thereafter) notify Parent of the identity of any Person with which the Company enters into
such a confidentiality (or similar) agreement.

6.3 Proxy Filing; Information Supplied. The Company will prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, and in any event, within 30 calendar days after the date of this Agreement, a Proxy Statement in preliminary
form relating to the Shareholders Meeting. As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and, in any event, within 20
calendar days of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and provide to Parent a reasonably complete draft of the preliminary Proxy
Statement. The Company agrees, as to it and its Subsidiaries, that at the date of mailing to shareholders of the Company and at the time
of the Shareholders Meeting (a) the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and (b) none of the information supplied by it or any of its Subsidiaries for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Parent agrees, as to it and its Affiliates, that at the date of mailing to shareholders of the
Company and at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, none of the information supplied by it or any of its Affiliates for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The Company will promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and will promptly

provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the Company and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent will each use its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with
respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company will cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be
mailed (i) if the SEC provides comments to the preliminary Proxy Statement, promptly after the date the SEC staff advises that it has
no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement or (ii) if, within 10 calendar days after
the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company has not received comments to the Preliminary Proxy Statement, promptly
after such 10th calendar day.

6.4 Shareholders Meeting. The Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its articles of incorporation and
bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the “Shareholders Meeting”) as promptly as practicable (and in
any event no more than 30 Business Days) after the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement to consider and vote upon the adoption of
this Agreement. Subject to Section 6.2(b) and 6.2(c), the board of directors of the Company will recommend such adoption and will
take all lawful action to solicit the Requisite Company Vote at the Shareholders Meeting. The Company will keep Parent reasonably
informed regarding the solicitation efforts and proxy tallies following the mailing of the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may only postpone or adjourn the Shareholders Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies
for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for
the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that the Company has determined based on advice of outside legal
counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to the Company’s
shareholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Shareholders Meeting, (iv) if, based on advice of outside counsel,
the Company determines that the failure to postpone or adjourn would reasonably be expected to be a violation of any applicable Order
or Law, or (v) with the written consent of Parent, which may be withheld in its sole discretion. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, but subject to Section 6.2(c), the Company’s obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.4 will not be affected
by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) the
board of directors of the Company making a Change of Recommendation.

promptly as practicable, including (i) the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notifications required to be filed to

information and documentary material required under the HSR Act and the Competition Act, to the extent necessary, proper or
advisable) required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, (v) using reasonable best efforts to

the provisions of this Section 6.5. In that regard, prior to the Closing, each party to this Agreement shall promptly (i) consult with the
other parties to this Agreement with respect to and provide any necessary information and assistance as the other parties may
reasonably request with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other parties (or their counsel) with copies of) all
notices, submissions or filings made by or on behalf of such party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by
or on behalf of such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, and
(ii) inform the other parties to this Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the other parties orally of) any communication from or to any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger, and
permit the other parties the opportunity to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other parties in
connection with, any proposed communication or submission with any such Governmental Entity to the extent practicable; provided,
however, that Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary
antitrust consents or approvals. No party shall participate in any substantive meeting with any Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate therein or thereat. Notwithstanding the foregoing
and subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and the Joint Defense Agreement between Parent, the Company and their respective
counsel dated July 19, 2016, Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 6.5(b) as “Outside Counsel Only Material.” Such materials
and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Section 6.5, materials provided pursuant to this Section 6.5 may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of
the Company and the Merger, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege concerns.

(c) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to make or file with the appropriate Governmental Entity all
filings, forms, registrations and notifications required to be filed to consummate the Merger under any applicable Antitrust Law, and
subsequent to such filings and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 6.5(b), the Company and Parent will, respond to inquiries
from Governmental Entities, or provide any supplemental information that may be requested by Governmental Entities, in connection
with filings made with such Governmental Entities. The Company and Parent shall file their notification and report forms under the
HSR Act no later than ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement or when advisable (but in no event later than 20 Business
Days after the date of this Agreement). The Company and Parent shall file with the Canadian Commissioner of Competition
(“Competition Commissioner”) a notification pursuant to subsection 114(1) of the Competition Act no later than ten Business Days
after the date of this Agreement or when advisable (but in no event later than 20 Business Days after the date of this Agreement), and
the Parent shall, within such time, make a submission to the Competition Commissioner in support of a request for an advance ruling
certificate or, if the Competition Commissioner is not prepared to issue an advance ruling certificate, a no-action letter. Subject to
Section 6.5(b) and the last sentence of this Section 6.5(c), in the event that the parties receive a request for information or documentary
material pursuant to any Antitrust Law, including the HSR Act and/or Competition Act (a “Second Request”), the parties will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to submit an appropriate response to, and to certify compliance with, such Second Request as
promptly as practicable, and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review
process; provided, however, in no event shall Parent or the Company delay certification of compliance with any such Second Request
beyond such date that is six months after the date hereof, except pursuant to a timing, settlement or similar agreement that is otherwise
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.5(c). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor the
Company, without the other party’s prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) shall (i)
enter into any timing, settlement or similar agreement, or otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement, that would have the effect of
extending, suspending, lengthening or otherwise tolling, beyond the date that is six months after the date hereof, the

expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act or, (ii) enter into any timing or similar
agreement, or otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement, that would bind or commit the parties not to complete the Merger (or that
would otherwise prevent or prohibit the parties from completing the Merger) prior to any date that is after the date that is six months
from the date hereof.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall, if required to permit
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b) and Section 7.1(c) as promptly as practicable, but subject to the last
sentence of this Section 6.5(d)), (i) propose, negotiate, commit to, effect and agree to, by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, holding separate, and other disposition of the businesses, assets, properties, products, product
lines, and equity interests of Parent, the Company, and their respective Subsidiaries and take such action or actions that would in the
aggregate have a similar effect, (ii) create, terminate, or divest relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of Parent, the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries, and (iii) otherwise take or commit to take any action that would limit Parent’s freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity interests, products, product
lines or properties of the Parent or Company (including any of their respective Subsidiaries); provided, that any such sales, divestitures,
licenses, holdings, dispositions, restrictions, changes or similar effects are conditioned upon and become effective only from and after
the Effective Time; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Parent or the Company to take, or cause
to be taken, or commit to take, or commit to cause to be taken, any divestiture, license, hold separate, sale or other disposition (A) that
would constitute a Triggering Divestiture or (B) of, or with respect to, Parent’s “CINTAS” trademark or trade name.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in this Section 6.5, if any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger; provided, that Parent shall bear all costs and expenses associated with contesting or
resisting any such action or proceeding.

6.6 Information; Status. The Company and Parent each will, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable Law and except as required by any Governmental Entity or any legally binding
obligation to a third party, the Company and Parent each will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity to the extent related to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company will
give prompt notice to Parent of any change, fact or condition that would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or
result in any failure of any condition to Parent’s obligations to effect the Merger and Parent will give prompt notice to the Company of
any change, fact or condition that would be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or result in any failure of any
condition to the Company’s obligations to effect the Merger.

Time and (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the

during normal business hours, to its employees,

properties, books, Contracts and records (including, for the avoidance of doubt, such items that are reasonably necessary, proper and
appropriate to assist Parent in its review of the draft Proxy Statement) and, during such period, the Company will (and will cause its
Subsidiaries to) furnish reasonably promptly to Parent all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested; provided, that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.7 will affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein; provided, further, that the foregoing will not require the Company (i) to
permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, would result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if the Company used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure,
(ii) take any action that would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other
applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information or (iii) to take any action that would give rise to a material risk of a
competitor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries receiving information that is competitively sensitive; provided, however, that in
such instances such party shall inform the other party of the general nature of the information being withheld and, upon the other
party’s request, reasonably cooperate with the other party to provide such information, in whole or in part, in a manner that would not
result in any of the outcomes described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii). All such information will be governed by the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

6.8 Financing and Financing Cooperation.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, advisable or proper to obtain the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter on or prior to the
Closing Date on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts
to: (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and any Definitive Debt Financing Agreements and comply with its
obligations thereunder; (ii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, seek a waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions to the funding
of the Debt Financing (including the Financing Conditions) set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements, in each case, within the control of Parent and required to be satisfied by it; (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive debt financing agreements on a timely basis on the terms and subject to the conditions contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter (including, if necessary, any “flex” provisions) (the “Definitive Debt Financing Agreements”); and (iv) if the Debt
Financing is necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2
and the Financing Conditions have been satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied, enforce all of its rights under the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter of the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements and cause the Financing Source Parties to fund the full amount of the
Debt Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice (i) of, to the Knowledge of Parent, any breach or default (or any
event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to result in breach or default)
by any party to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, (ii) if and when, to the Knowledge of Parent, any portion of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter may not be available on the Closing Date for the purposes of
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) of any expiration or termination of the Debt Financing other
than an expiration or termination in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter. Upon the reasonable request
of the Company, Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis with reasonably detailed information about the
status of its efforts to obtain the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and the Replacement
Financings, if any, and provide to the Company copies of all material definitive documents related to the Debt Financing (provided,
however, any fee letter may be customarily redacted in respect of (x) fee amounts and pricing and (y) terms of any market flex in a
manner reasonably satisfactory to the Financing Source Parties). If the Debt Financing is necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, then neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall take any action that could reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Debt Financing.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment
or other modification of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Financing Agreements if such termination,
amendment or modification (i) reduces the aggregate amount of proceeds of the Debt Financing (including by way of increased OID or
fees) necessary to pay the Merger Amount or (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or otherwise modifies any of the Financing
Conditions or other terms in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) materially delay or prevent the Closing or (y) make the
timely funding of the Debt Financing or satisfaction of the Financing Conditions materially less likely to occur, other than, in each
case, (A) a waiver of any closing conditions by lender(s) or their agent or (B) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment Letter as of the date hereof or to reassign titles to such
parties who had executed the Debt Financing Commitment Letter as of the date hereof; provided, that Parent shall have the right to
substitute other financing for all or any portion of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative Financing Source Parties as set
forth (and subject to the requirements) below, without the Company’s prior written consent. Upon any such amendment, modification
or substitution (including with any Replacement Financing), the term “Debt Financing Commitment Letter” and “Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements” shall mean the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Financing Agreement, as applicable, as
so amended or modified and shall include the related commitment letters, engagement letters, term sheets and other definitive
agreements with respect to each Replacement Financing; provided, that in the event the commitments under the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter are reduced as a result of or in connection with any Replacement Financing, the term “Debt Financing” shall be
deemed to include such Replacement Financing. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such material amendment
or other modification of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter.

(c) Parent shall have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated equity offerings or debt offerings or other
incurrences of debt for all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter by reducing
commitments under the Debt Financing Commitment Letter; provided, that (i) to the extent any such equity or debt has a scheduled
special or mandatory redemption right, such right is not exercisable prior to the earliest of the consummation of the Merger on the
Closing Date, the termination of this Agreement and the End Date and (ii) the conditions to the use of such proceeds to pay the Merger
Amount when due shall be no more restrictive, taken as a whole, than the Financing Conditions.

(d) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing necessary to pay the Merger Amount becomes unavailable, then Parent shall
promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the reasons therefore and use its reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange to obtain,
as promptly as practicable, from the same and/or alternative Financing Source Parties, alternative financing in an amount sufficient to
pay the Merger Amount when due containing conditions to closing and funding that (A) are not more onerous, taken as a whole, than
the Financing Conditions and (B) would not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing and (ii) obtain, and when obtained,
promptly deliver to the Company copies of the new financing commitment letter that provides for such alternative financing. In the
event any alternative financing is obtained in accordance with this Section 6.8(d) (“Alternative Financing”), references in this
Agreement to the Debt Financing shall also be deemed to refer to such Alternative Financing, and if one or more commitment letters or
definitive financing agreements are entered into or proposed to be entered into in connection with such Alternative Financing,
references in this Agreement to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements shall also be
deemed to refer to such commitment letters and definitive financing agreements relating to such Alternative Financing, and all
obligations of Parent pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as Parent’s obligations with respect to
the Debt Financing.

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective officers, directors, employee, attorneys, accountants and other Representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to provide at
Parent’s sole cost and expense all customary cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary in connection with arranging,
obtaining and syndicating the Debt Financing and the Replacement Financings, if any, to the extent that the participation by members

designating, upon request, whether any such information is suitable to be made available to lenders and other investors who do not
wish to receive material non-public information, (iv) designating one or more members of senior management of the Company to
participate, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, in due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, management presentations,

or more road shows, (v) assist the Parent in obtaining any corporate credit and family ratings, and if applicable, facility ratings from
any rating agencies, (vi) requesting the Company’s independent auditors to cooperate with Parent’s independent auditors, participate in

none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents or other Representatives shall
be required to (w) pay any commitment or other fee, provide any security or incur any Cost or obligation in connection with the Debt
Financing prior to the Effective Time, except such expenses for which Parent is obligated to reimburse the Company, (x) take or permit
the taking of any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict with, result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or

suffered or incurred by them in connection with the Debt Financing, except in the event such loss or damage arises out of or results
from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith by the Company or its Subsidiaries in fulfilling their obligations pursuant to
this Section 6.8. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.8, the condition set forth in Section 7.2(b) as it
applies to the Company’s obligations under this Section 6.8, shall automatically be deemed satisfied, except to the extent the Company
has breached its obligations under this Section 6.8, Parent has provided written notice to the Company of such breach within five (5)
Business Days of first becoming aware of such breach and the Company fails to cure such breach by the earlier of five (5) Business
Days after such notice is provided or the End Date. Subject to Parent’s indemnification obligations under this Section 6.8, the Company
hereby consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries’ corporate logos in connection with the initial syndication or marketing of

and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no
more than ten calendar days after the Closing Date.

6.10 Publicity. The initial press release regarding this Agreement and the Merger will be a joint press release. Thereafter each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto (which consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), it will not issue any press releases or otherwise make a public announcement with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by making any filings with any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity (including Nasdaq) with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant

limitations or periods were satisfied under

a similar Benefit Plan, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to give each Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which
the Effective Time occurs towards applicable deductibles, coinsurance and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to
the Effective Time for which payment has been made. To the extent that it would not result in a duplication of benefits and to the extent
that such service was recognized under a similar Benefit Plan, Parent shall give each Continuing Employee service credit for such
Continuing Employee’s employment with the Company and with any entity with respect to which the Company provides service credit
for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting credit (but excluding benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) under
each applicable Parent benefit plan, as if such service had been performed with Parent.

(c) If requested by Parent in writing within 30 Business Days prior to the Effective Time, effective immediately prior to, and
contingent upon, the Closing, the Company will adopt such resolutions and/or amendments to terminate each Benefit Plan listed in
Section 6.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter (each, a “Terminated Plan”). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will provide
Parent with a copy of the resolutions and/or plan amendments (the form and substance of which will be subject to review and approval
by Parent) evidencing that each Terminated Plan has been terminated.

Bargaining Employees, (iii) if requested by Parent prior to September 30, 2016 upon advice from counsel, the G&K Services 401(k)
Savings Incentive Plan, and (iv) if requested by Parent prior to September 30, 2016 upon advice from counsel, the G&K Services

the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Affiliates may terminate the employment or service of any Continuing Employee or other service provider at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any
Benefit Plan or any “employee benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates or (ii)
without limiting any of the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation under this Article VI, alter or limit the ability of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan or any other
compensation or benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.11 shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
Continuing Employee or current or former service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents
thereof).

6.12 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5 and except for the filings fees associated with the Company
Approvals, the Parent Approvals and any other filings with Governmental Entities contemplated by Section 6.5, which fees will be
divided equally between the Company and Parent, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be paid by the party
incurring such expense.

6.13 Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold
harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such

Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby or
arising out of or pertaining to such transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent that the Company would have been authorized to indemnify such Indemnified Persons under its articles of incorporation or
bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement (and Parent will or will cause the Surviving Corporation to advance expenses as incurred
to the fullest extent authorized under applicable Law; provided, that the Indemnified Person to whom expenses are advanced provides
the undertaking required by applicable Law to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Person is not
entitled to indemnification).

(b) For a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall include provisions for indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnified
Persons on the same basis as set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company in effect on the date of this
Agreement. Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain in effect the provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws providing for indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation of the Indemnified Persons, as applicable, with respect to the facts or circumstances occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time to the fullest extent authorized from time to time under applicable Law, and such provisions shall not be amended
except as required by applicable Law or to make changes permitted by applicable Law that would enlarge the scope of the Indemnified
Persons’ indemnification rights thereunder.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will and, if the Company is unable to, Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain (and, in either case, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to keep in effect
thereafter) “tail” insurance policies for the extension of the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of the Company’s existing
directors’ and officers’ insurance policies for a claims period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s insurance carriers as of the date hereof with respect to directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance (collectively, “D&O Insurance”) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
comparable to the Company’s existing policies with respect to any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby or arising out
of or pertaining to such transactions), provided that the cost thereof does not exceed an amount equal to 300% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance (which premium amount the Company represents and warrants is as set forth in
Section 6.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to,
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time the D&O Insurance in place as of the
date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are comparable to the insureds as provided in the Company’s
existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase
comparable D&O Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are comparable to the
insureds as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date hereof with respect to any matter existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby or arising out of or pertaining to such transactions); provided, however, that in no event will Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 200% of the
annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of that consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provisions to be made
prior to the consummation of any

the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.13.

(e) This Section 6.13 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Persons and
shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. Each Indemnified Person shall be a third-party
beneficiary of this Section 6.13 and entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this Section 6.13. If any Indemnified Person makes
any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this Section 6.13 that is denied by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Person is entitled to such indemnification, then
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay such Indemnified Person’s costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and
expenses, incurred in connection with pursuing such claim against Parent or the Surviving Corporation. The rights of the Indemnified
Persons under this Section 6.13 shall be in addition to any rights that such Indemnified Person may have under the organizational
documents of the Company or under any applicable Contracts, insurance policies or applicable Laws.

6.14 Other Actions by the Company.

(a) Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and its board of directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on such transactions.

(b) Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take such steps as may be reasonably requested by
Parent to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each director or officer of the Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(c) Director Resignations. Except as may otherwise be agreed by Parent, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain and deliver to Parent at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation effective as of the Effective
Time, of those directors of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries who are in office immediately prior to the Effective Time.

6.15 Shareholder Litigation. If any shareholder litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is brought, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing, against the Company and/or
the members of the board of directors of the Company prior to the Effective Time, the Company will (i) promptly notify Parent and
will keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof and (ii) provide Parent with the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of such litigation. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or Representative of the Company will compromise,
settle or agree to compromise or settle any such shareholder litigation or consent to the same, unless Parent will have consented in
writing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

8.5 Effect of Termination and Abandonment. Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) below, in the event of termination of
this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement will become void and of no effect
with no liability to any Person on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Affiliates or Representatives); provided, however, and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, that (i) no such termination will relieve any party hereto of its obligation to pay the
Termination Fee or Reverse Termination Fee (as applicable), the expense obligations pursuant to this Section 8.5(c) or any damages to
any other party hereto resulting from any deliberate and material breach of this Agreement and (ii) the provisions set forth in this
Section 8.5 and the second sentence of Section 9.1 will survive the termination of this Agreement.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated:

(i) pursuant to Section 8.3(a);

(ii) pursuant to Section 8.4(a) or Section 8.4(b); or

(iii) pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.4(c), and (A) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the date of the
termination of this Agreement, any Person will have made or publicly disclosed or announced an Acquisition Proposal and
(B) within 12 months after termination of this Agreement, the Company will have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or consummated a transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal (provided that,
solely for purposes of this clause (B), the references to “15%” in the definition of “Acquisition Proposal” will be deemed to
be references to “50.1%”),

then the Company will pay Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the Termination Fee, (x) in the
case of clause (a)(i) above, prior to or on the day of such termination, (y) in the case of clause (a)(ii) above, within two Business Days

Order relates to the HSR Act or any other competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Law or regulation, or (ii) pursuant to Section
8.2(a) and, in the case of this clause (ii), at the time of such termination, all of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2
have been satisfied (other than (x) Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c) (but, in the case Section 7.1(c), only if the applicable Order relates

HSR Act or any other competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Law or regulation) and (y) conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but that are capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur on the date of such termination), then
Parent shall pay to the Company, by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account specified by the Company, an amount
equal to the Reverse Termination Fee; provided, however, that no Reverse Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to this Section
8.5(b) in the event that the failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c) (but, in the case Section 7.1(c), only if
the applicable Order relates to the HSR Act or any other competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Law or regulation) to be
satisfied is a result of the Company’s breach of Section 6.5 (other than any immaterial breach). The Reverse Termination Fee due under
this Section 8.5(b) shall be paid on the second Business Day immediately following the date of termination of this Agreement.

(c) The parties each acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement, and that
any amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.5(a) do not constitute a penalty but constitute payment of liquidated damages and that each
of the respective liquidated damages amounts is reasonable in light of the substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to be caused
by the other party’s breach or default under this Agreement, the difficulty of proof of loss of damages, the inconvenience and non-
feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and the value of the transactions to be consummated thereunder. If either party
fails to pay when due any amount payable pursuant to Section 8.5(a) or Section 8.5(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company or Parent (as applicable) for the fee
set forth in Section 8.5(a) or Section 8.5(b) (as applicable) or any portion of such fee, the Company or Parent shall pay to Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company (as applicable) its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

(c) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties will be entitled

parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

9.9 Obligations of Parent and of the Company. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such
requirement will be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this

provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application of such provision to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision will

circumstances will not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor will such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity
or enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

9.11 Interpretation; Construction. The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference only, do not
constitute part of this Agreement and will not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference will be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by
the words “without limitation.” All pronouns and all variations thereof will be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine or neuter,
singular or plural, as the identity of the Person may require. The defined terms contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular, as well as to the plural, forms of such terms. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to any Contract (including this
Agreement), statute or regulation, such references are to, except as context may otherwise require, the statute or regulation as amended,
modified, supplemented, restated or replaced from time to time (in the case of a Contract, to the extent permitted by the terms thereof);
and to any section of any statute or regulation including any successor to the section and, in the case of any statute, any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder. All references to “dollars” or “$” in this Agreement are to United States dollars. Each party to this
Agreement has or may have set forth information in its respective disclosure letter in a section of such disclosure letter that corresponds
to the section of this Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a disclosure schedule to this
Agreement will not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement or to otherwise imply that
any such item has had or is reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or otherwise
represents an exception or material fact, event or circumstance for the purpose of this Agreement. Headings inserted in the sections or
subsections of a disclosure letter are for convenience of reference only and will to no extent have the effect of amending or changing
the express terms of the sections or subsections set forth in this Agreement.

9.12 Assignment. This Agreement will not be assignable by operation of Law or otherwise, except that Parent will be entitled to
assign this Agreement (in whole or in part) to any Affiliate of Parent; provided, that in the case of any such assignment by Parent,
Parent will remain responsible for the performance of the obligations hereunder by such Affiliate. Any purported assignment in
violation of this Agreement is void.

9.13 Liability of Financing Source Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company agrees that it
will not have any rights or claims against any Financing Source Party (in their capacity as such) in connection with this Agreement, the
Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and no Financing Source Party will have any rights or claims
against the Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the

Annex B

August 15, 2016

The Board of Directors
G&K Services, Inc.
5595 Opus Parkway, Suite 500
Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343

Members of the Board of Directors:

We understand that G&K Services, Inc. (“G&K Services”) proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
“Agreement”), among G&K Services, Cintas Corporation (“Cintas”) and Bravo Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Cintas
(“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will merge with and into G&K Services (the “Merger”) and each
outstanding share of the Class A Common Stock, par value $0.50 per share, of G&K Services (“G&K Services Common Stock”) (other
than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares (each as defined in the Agreement)) will be converted into the right to receive $97.50 in
cash (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of G&K Services Common Stock
(other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) of the Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger.

In connection with this opinion, we have, among other things:
 

 (i) reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to G&K Services;
 

 

(ii) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to the business, operations and prospects of
G&K Services furnished to or discussed with us by the management of G&K Services, including certain financial forecasts
relating to G&K Services prepared by or at the direction of and approved by the management of G&K Services (such
forecasts, “G&K Services Forecasts”);

 

 
(iii) discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of G&K Services with members of

senior management of G&K Services;
 

 
(iv) reviewed the trading history for G&K Services Common Stock and a comparison of that trading history with the trading

histories of other companies we deemed relevant;
 

 
(v) compared certain financial and stock market information of G&K Services with similar information of other companies we

deemed relevant;
 

 
(vi) compared certain financial terms of the Merger to financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of other transactions we

deemed relevant;

 (vii) reviewed a draft, dated August 14, 2016, of the Agreement (the “Draft Agreement”); and
 

 (viii) performed such other analyses and studies and considered such other information and factors as we deemed appropriate.

In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of
the financial and other information and data publicly available or provided to or otherwise reviewed by or discussed with us and have
relied upon the assurances of the management of G&K Services that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make
such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to the G&K Services Forecasts, we have been
advised by G&K Services, and have assumed, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and good faith judgments of the management of G&K Services as to the future financial performance of G&K Services. We
have not made or been provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of
G&K Services, nor have we made any physical inspection of the properties or assets of G&K Services. We have not evaluated the
solvency or fair value of G&K Services or Cintas under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters. We have assumed, at the direction of G&K Services, that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with its terms,
without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the
necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction
or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that would have an adverse
effect on G&K Services. We also have assumed, at the direction of G&K Services, that that the final executed Agreement will not
differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement reviewed by us.

We express no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects of the Merger (other than the Consideration to the extent expressly
specified herein), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger. As you are aware, we were not requested to, and
we did not, solicit indications of interest or proposals from third parties regarding a possible acquisition of all or any part of G&K
Services or any alternative transaction. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be
received by holders of G&K Services Common Stock and no opinion or view is expressed with respect to any consideration received in
connection with the Merger by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. In addition, no
opinion or view is expressed with respect to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any
compensation to any of the officers, directors or employees of any party to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the
Consideration. Furthermore, no opinion or view is expressed as to the relative merits of the Merger in comparison to other strategies or
transactions that might be available to G&K Services or in which G&K Services might engage or as to the underlying business
decision of G&K Services to proceed with or effect the Merger. In addition, we express no opinion or recommendation as to how any
stockholder should vote or act in connection with the Merger or any related matter.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of G&K Services in connection with the Merger and will receive a
fee for our services, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a significant portion of which is contingent
upon consummation of the Merger. In addition, G&K Services has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us against certain
liabilities arising out of our engagement.

all shareholders who have complied with subdivision 3, (ii) all shareholders who did not sign or consent to a written action that gave
effect to the action creating the right to obtain payment under section 302A.471, and (iii) all shareholders entitled to dissent if no
shareholder vote was required, a notice that contains:

(1) the address to which a demand for payment and certificates of certificated shares must be sent in order to obtain payment and
the date by which they must be received;

(2) any restrictions on transfer of uncertificated shares that will apply after the demand for payment is received;

(3) a form to be used to certify the date on which the shareholder, or the beneficial owner on whose behalf the shareholder

(b) In order to receive the fair value of the shares, a dissenting shareholder must demand payment and deposit certificated shares
or comply with any restrictions on transfer of uncertificated shares within 30 days after the notice required by paragraph (a) was given,
but the dissenter retains all other rights of a shareholder until the proposed action takes effect.

Subd. 5. Payment; return of shares.

(a) After the corporate action takes effect, or after the corporation receives a valid demand for payment, whichever is later, the
corporation shall remit to each dissenting shareholder who has complied with subdivisions 3 and 4 the amount the corporation
estimates to be the fair value of the shares, plus interest, accompanied by:

(1) the corporation’s closing balance sheet and statement of income for a fiscal year ending not more than 16 months before the
effective date of the corporate action, together with the latest available interim financial statements;

(2) an estimate by the corporation of the fair value of the shares and a brief description of the method used to reach the estimate;
and

(3) a copy of section 302A.471 and this section, and a brief description of the procedure to be followed in demanding
supplemental payment.

(b) The corporation may withhold the remittance described in paragraph (a) from a person who was not a shareholder on the date
the action dissented from was first announced to the public or who is dissenting on behalf of a person who was not a beneficial owner
on that date. If the dissenter has complied with subdivisions 3 and 4, the corporation shall forward to the dissenter the materials
described in paragraph (a), a statement of the reason for withholding the remittance, and an offer to pay to the dissenter the amount
listed in the materials if the dissenter agrees to accept that amount in full satisfaction. The dissenter may decline the offer and demand
payment under subdivision 6. Failure to do so entitles the dissenter only to the amount offered. If the dissenter makes demand,
subdivisions 7 and 8 apply.

(c) If the corporation fails to remit payment within 60 days of the deposit of certificates or the imposition of transfer restrictions
on uncertificated shares, it shall return all deposited certificates and cancel all transfer restrictions. However, the corporation may again
give notice under subdivision 4 and require deposit or restrict transfer at a later time.

Subd. 6. Supplemental payment; demand.

If a dissenter believes that the amount remitted under subdivision 5 is less than the fair value of the shares plus interest, the
dissenter may give written notice to the corporation of the dissenter’s own estimate of the fair value of the shares, plus interest, within
30 days after the corporation mails the remittance under subdivision 5, and demand payment of the difference. Otherwise, a dissenter is
entitled only to the amount remitted by the corporation.

Subd. 7. Petition; determination.

If the corporation receives a demand under subdivision 6, it shall, within 60 days after receiving the demand, either pay to the
dissenter the amount demanded or agreed to by the dissenter after discussion with the corporation or file in court a petition requesting
that the court determine the fair value of the shares, plus interest. The petition shall be filed in the county in which the registered office
of the corporation is located, except that a surviving foreign corporation that receives a demand relating to the shares of a constituent
domestic corporation shall file the petition in the county in this state in which the last registered office of the constituent corporation
was located. The petition shall name as parties all dissenters who have demanded payment under subdivision 6 and who have not
reached agreement with the corporation. The corporation shall, after filing the petition, serve

all parties with a summons and copy of the petition under the Rules of Civil Procedure. Nonresidents of this state may be served by
registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law. Except as otherwise provided, the Rules of Civil Procedure apply to
this proceeding. The jurisdiction of the court is plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint appraisers, with powers and authorities
the court deems proper, to receive evidence on and recommend the amount of the fair value of the shares. The court shall determine
whether the shareholder or shareholders in question have fully complied with the requirements of this section, and shall determine the
fair value of the shares, taking into account any and all factors the court finds relevant, computed by any method or combination of
methods that the court, in its discretion, sees fit to use, whether or not used by the corporation or by a dissenter. The fair value of the
shares as determined by the court is binding on all shareholders, wherever located. A dissenter is entitled to judgment in cash for the
amount by which the fair value of the shares as determined by the court, plus interest, exceeds the amount, if any, remitted under
subdivision 5, but shall not be liable to the corporation for the amount, if any, by which the amount, if any, remitted to the dissenter
under subdivision 5 exceeds the fair value of the shares as determined by the court, plus interest.

Subd. 8. Costs; fees; expenses.

(a) The court shall determine the costs and expenses of a proceeding under subdivision 7, including the reasonable expenses and
compensation of any appraisers appointed by the court, and shall assess those costs and expenses against the corporation, except that
the court may assess part or all of those costs and expenses against a dissenter whose action in demanding payment under subdivision 6
is found to be arbitrary, vexatious, or not in good faith.

(b) If the court finds that the corporation has failed to comply substantially with this section, the court may assess all fees and
expenses of any experts or attorneys as the court deems equitable. These fees and expenses may also be assessed against a person who
has acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith in bringing the proceeding, and may be awarded to a party injured by those
actions.

(c) The court may award, in its discretion, fees and expenses to an attorney for the dissenters out of the amount awarded to the
dissenters, if any.

Annex D

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We report our consolidated financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). To supplement
these consolidated financial results, management believes that certain non-GAAP operating results provide a more meaningful measure
on which to compare our results of operations between periods. We believe these non-GAAP results provide useful information to both
management and investors by excluding certain amounts that impact comparability of the results. The non-GAAP financial measures
are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read in conjunction with
G&K’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliation to GAAP measures presented
herein. A reconciliation of operating income, net income and earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis to adjusted earnings per
diluted share on a non-GAAP basis is presented in the table below:
