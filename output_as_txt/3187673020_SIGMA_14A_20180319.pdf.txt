March 19, 2018

 
Dear Shareholder:
 

You are invited to attend a special meeting of shareholders of common stock of Sigma Designs, Inc., a California corporation
(“Sigma,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), to be held on April 17, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. local time, at our principal executive
offices located at 47467 Fremont Blvd., Fremont, California 94538.
 

At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon (i) a proposal to approve the sale to Silicon Laboratories Inc.
(“Silicon Labs”) of all of the assets which relate to our Z-Wave business, including all of our equity interest in certain subsidiaries
engaged in the Z-Wave business, and the assumption by Silicon Labs of all of our liabilities related to our Z-Wave business, for $240
million in cash (the “Asset Sale”) pursuant to an agreement with Silicon Labs and Sequin Merger Subsidiary, Inc. (“Merger Sub”)
dated December 7, 2017 (the “Agreement”), (ii) a proposal to approve the voluntary liquidation and dissolution of the Company
pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution (the “Plan of Liquidation”), (iii) a proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory
vote, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to our current and former named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Asset Sale and the Plan of Liquidation (the “Golden Parachute Compensation”), and (iv) a proposal to adjourn
the special meeting to a later date, if necessary or appropriate, to allow for the solicitation of additional proxies in the event that there
are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Asset Sale and the Plan of Liquidation.
 

The Asset Sale is the result of a broad review of strategic alternatives by our board of directors, which resulted in entering into an
agreement to be acquired by Silicon Labs or, alternatively, to sell our Z-Wave business to Silicon Labs. Despite our reasonable best
efforts, we were unable to satisfy certain conditions in the Agreement that required us to sell or shut down our television and set-top
box business in the manner and timeframe required by the Agreement, and to amend or terminate certain contracts pursuant to the
Agreement. These conditions were required to be satisfied prior to Silicon Labs being required to move forward with a merger (the
“Merger”) of Merger Sub with and into the Company pursuant to which the Company would have become a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Silicon Labs. After careful consideration, the board of directors unanimously determined that the Asset Sale, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement, is fair to, and in the best interests of, Sigma and its shareholders and unanimously
approved and declared advisable the Asset Sale and the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.
 

In addition, the board of directors has determined that the best course of action following the Asset Sale is the orderly liquidation,
winding up, and dissolution of our remaining businesses and assets as opposed to continuing to operate our business. Accordingly,
shareholders are also being asked to approve the Plan of Liquidation.
 

The Asset Sale, as contemplated by the Agreement, is conditioned upon receiving approval from our shareholders. Shareholder
approval may also be required under California law, as the sale of assets which relate to our Z-Wave business may constitute a sale of
substantially all of the assets of the Company. Our market capitalization based on the closing price of our common stock on December
7, 2017 was $223.1 million. The proposals to approve the Asset Sale pursuant to the Agreement and to approve the subsequent
dissolution and liquidation of the Company pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Therefore, it is very important that your shares be represented and voted at the
meeting.
 

The Asset Sale is not conditioned upon shareholders approving the Plan of Liquidation or the Golden Parachute Compensation.
The effectiveness of the Plan of Liquidation and payment of any Golden Parachute Compensation are conditioned upon the
consummation of the Asset Sale. The adjournment proposal is not conditioned upon the approval of any other proposal set forth in the
proxy statement. Shareholders do not have dissenters’ rights of appraisal in connection with the Asset Sale or the Plan of Liquidation.
 

If the shareholders approve the Asset Sale and the Plan of Liquidation, we intend to sell our remaining assets and seek to wind
down our business pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Liquidation. We expect this process may take 12 months or longer. Once our
business operations are wound up, we will file a Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of California, and
will close our stock transfer books, after which it will not be possible for shareholders to trade our stock.

The Company plans to distribute, in an initial distribution (with potential subsequent distributions thereafter) a portion of the net
proceeds from the Asset Sale, subject to a contingency reserve for costs and liabilities, as soon as practicable following the closing of
the Asset Sale. The amount and timing of distributions to shareholders will be determined by the board of directors in its discretion,
subject to the provisions of the Plan of Liquidation. On the bases described in the accompanying proxy statement, the board of
directors anticipates that the amount of the initial distribution to shareholders following the Asset Sale will be between $230 and $250
million or $5.82 to $6.33 per share based on 39,499,507 shares outstanding as of February 26, 2018. Following the initial distribution,
the board of directors anticipates distributing up to an additional $10 million to shareholders for aggregate total distributions of $230
to $260 million or $5.82 to $6.58 per share based on 39,499,507 shares outstanding as of February 26, 2018. However, there can be no
guarantee as to the timing and amount of distributions to our shareholders, even if all of our remaining assets are sold, because there
are many factors, some of which are outside of our control, which could affect our ability to make such distributions. If you are not a
shareholder of record as of the record date for a distribution as determined by the Company Board, you will not be entitled to receive
that distribution. Shareholders will not know at the time of voting the amount of consideration they will receive in these distributions.
In addition, only shareholders of record as of the record date for a distribution as determined by the Company Board will be entitled to
receive that distribution.
 

The enclosed proxy statement provides you with detailed information about the special meeting and the proposed transactions. In
particular, please review the matters referred to under “Risk Factors” beginning on page 18 for a discussion of the risks related to the
Asset Sale and the Plan of Liquidation. We encourage you to read the proxy statement and all annexes thereto carefully and in their
entirety. You may also obtain additional information about us from documents we have filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which are available without charge through the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website at http://www.sec.gov.
 

The board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the approval of the Asset Sale, “FOR” the
approval of the Plan of Liquidation, “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting to solicit additional votes to approve
the Asset Sale or the Plan of Liquidation, if necessary or appropriate, and “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to
approve certain compensation that will or may become payable to our current and former named executive officers that is
based on or otherwise relates to the Asset Sale and the liquidation and dissolution of the Company.
 

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. The Asset Sale and the liquidation and
dissolution cannot be completed unless approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of our common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting in person,
please sign and return the enclosed proxy card, or vote electronically over the Internet or by telephone as described in the
proxy materials. If you attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you may do so even though you have previously
voted by proxy. The failure to vote will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the approval of the Asset Sale and
“AGAINST” the approval of the Plan of Liquidation.
 

If your shares are held in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares in
accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your bank,
broker or other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals without your instructions, and the failure to instruct your bank,
broker or other nominee how to vote will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the approval of the Asset Sale and
“AGAINST” the approval of the Plan of Liquidation. 
 
 Sincerely,
  
 /s/ Elias Nader

 
Elias Nader
Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, and Chief
Financial Officer

outstanding shares of common stock represented at the special meeting, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon, is
required to approve each of the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal.

 
Shareholders will not know at the time of voting the amount of consideration they will receive. In addition, only shareholders of

The failure of any shareholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, vote electronically over the Internet or by telephone or
vote in person by ballot at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Asset Sale Proposal and
“AGAINST” the Liquidation Proposal. The failure of any shareholder of record to submit a signed proxy card, vote electronically
over the Internet or by telephone or attend the special meeting in person will not have any effect on the Golden Parachute
Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal; however, if a shareholder of record attends the special meeting in person but
has not submitted a proxy and fails to vote in person by ballot, that will be treated as an abstention. Abstentions will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Asset Sale Proposal, the Liquidation Proposal, the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal and the
Adjournment Proposal. If you hold your shares in “street name” and fail to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to
vote, your shares will not be voted, which will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the Asset Sale Proposal and Liquidation
Proposal, but will have no effect on the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal assuming a quorum is
present at the special meeting. The required quorum for the transaction of business at the special meeting exists when the holders of a
majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting are represented either in person or by proxy. If a quorum
is not present at the special meeting, we expect that the special meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies. Abstentions and
“broker non-votes” count as present for establishing a quorum.
 

Please vote promptly whether or not you expect to attend the special meeting.
 
  
 By Order of the Board of Directors,

On December 7, 2017, Sigma entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the Company, Silicon Labs and
Sequin Merger Subsidiary, Inc. (“Merger Sub”) attached as Annex A (the “Agreement”). The parties had contemplated that Silicon
Labs would acquire Sigma pursuant to a merger of Merger Sub with and into Sigma (the “Merger”) if Sigma was able to satisfy certain

payable at the closing (the “Asset Sale”).
 

We encourage you to carefully read in its entirety the Agreement, which is the principal document governing the Asset Sale.

The Special Meeting (page 24) 
 

The special meeting of shareholders will be held on April 17, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. local time at 47467 Fremont Blvd., Fremont, CA
94538. At the special meeting, our shareholders will be asked to vote on the proposal to approve the Asset Sale (the “Asset Sale
Proposal”), a proposal to approve the Plan of Liquidation (the “Liquidation Proposal”), a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in the event that there are not sufficient votes in favor of approval of
the Asset Sale or the Plan of Liquidation at the time of the special meeting (the “Adjournment Proposal”), a non-binding advisory
proposal on the compensation that may be paid or become payable to our current and former named executive officers that is based on
or otherwise relates to the Asset Sale or the Plan of Liquidation (the “Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal”), and any other
business that may properly come before the special meeting and any adjournment(s) or postponement(s).
 
Shareholders Entitled to Vote; Record Date (page 24)
 

Only holders of record of shares of Sigma’s common stock (the “Company Common Stock”) on February 26, 2018 (the “Record
Date”) may vote at the special meeting. For each share of Company Common Stock that you owned on the Record Date, you are
entitled to cast one vote on each matter voted upon at the special meeting. On the Record Date, 39,499,507 shares of Company
Common Stock were entitled to vote at the special meeting.
 
Quorum and Vote Required (page 24) 
 

A quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold the special meeting. The required quorum for the transaction of business at the
special meeting exists when the holders of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the special meeting
are represented either in person or by proxy. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that the special meeting will
be adjourned to solicit additional proxies. Abstentions and “broker non-votes” count as present for establishing a quorum.
 

Approval of the Asset Sale Proposal and the Liquidation Proposal require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Failure to vote, by proxy or in person, or failure to instruct
your broker, bank or nominee how to vote shares of Company Common Stock held in street name will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the Asset Sale Proposal and the Liquidation Proposal. The Adjournment Proposal will be approved if a majority of the
shares of Company Common Stock, present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter, vote in favor
of the proposal. The Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal will be approved on a non-binding, advisory basis, if a majority of the
shares of Company Common Stock, present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter, vote in favor
of the proposal. 
 
Shares Owned by Our Directors and Executive Officers (page 25) 
 

As of the Record Date, our current and certain former directors and executive officers were entitled to vote 1,142,751 shares of
Company Common Stock, or approximately 2.9% of Company Common Stock outstanding on that date. These numbers do not give
effect to any outstanding option to purchase Company Common Stock (each, a “Company Option”) or restricted stock units of
Company Common Stock (each, a “Company RSU”), none of which are entitled to vote at the special meeting. Our current directors
(with the exception of Mr. Awsare), certain former directors and our executive officers have entered into voting agreements obligating
them to vote all of their shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the Asset Sale Proposal and any other proposals necessary to
consummate the Asset Sale.
 
Recommendation of the Company Board; Reasons for the Asset Sale (page 58) 
 

The board of directors of the Company (the “Company Board”) unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Asset Sale
Proposal, “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal and “FOR” the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal.
 

Shareholders will not know at the time of voting the amount of consideration they will receive. In addition, only shareholders of
record as of the record date for a distribution as determined by the Company Board will be entitled to receive that distribution.
 

In reaching its decision to approve the Asset Sale and the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and, subject to the terms
and conditions of the Agreement, to recommend the approval of the Asset Sale Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal and the Golden
Parachute Compensation Proposal to our shareholders, the Company Board consulted with our management, as well as our legal and
financial advisors, and considered the terms of the proposed Agreement and the transactions set forth in the Agreement, as well as
other alternative transactions, including contacts and extensive discussions with other potential acquirers.

considered and limitations, qualifications and conditions on the review undertaken in connection therewith, as described in Deutsche

● (i) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976 in the United States and any other applicable foreign antitrust and competition laws; (ii) the absence of any non-
appealable legal requirement of any governmental entity making illegal, permanently enjoining or otherwise permanently
prohibiting, limiting, delaying, or otherwise restraining the consummation of the transactions; and (iii) the absence of any
pending action commenced by a governmental entity seeking to prohibit, enjoin, materially limit, delay or otherwise restrain
the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

 
The obligations of Silicon Labs to consummate the Asset Sale will be subject to the satisfaction or written waiver at or prior to the

Effective Time of the Asset Sale of each of the following conditions:
 

 
●  with specified qualifications and exceptions, the truth and correctness of the Company’s representations and warranties

contained in the Agreement as of the date of the Agreement and the closing date of the Asset Sale;
 

 
● the Company will have performed and complied in all material respects with the covenants and agreements to be performed

or complied with by it under the Agreement;
 

 
● since the date of the Agreement, there will not have occurred and be continuing any change, event, development, condition,

occurrence or effect or state of facts that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company; and

 

 

●  the delivery by the Company to Silicon Labs of an executed Foreign Investment and Real Property Tax Act of 1980
notification letter which states that an interest in the Company is not a real property interest because the Company has not
been a “United States real property holding corporation” under Section 897(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), and a form of notice to the Internal Revenue Service.

 
The obligation of the Company to consummate the Asset Sale will be subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by

applicable law) written waiver at or prior to the Effective Time of the Asset Sale of each of the following conditions:
 

 
● with specified qualifications and exceptions, the truth and correctness of Silicon Labs and Merger Sub’s representations and

warranties contained in the Agreement as of the date of the Agreement and the closing date of the Asset Sale; and
 

 
● each of Silicon Labs and Merger Sub will have performed and complied in all material respects with the covenants and

agreements to be performed or complied with by it under the Agreement.
 
Non-Solicitation, Acquisition Proposals; Change in Recommendation
 

The Company is subject to customary restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and to
provide information to, and enter into discussions or negotiations with, third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals.
However, prior to shareholder approval of the Asset Sale, the solicitation restrictions are subject to a customary “fiduciary-out”
provision that allows Sigma, under certain circumstances, to provide information to and participate in negotiations or discussions with
third parties with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal if it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary
duties under applicable law.
 

Prior to shareholder approval of the Asset Sale, the Company Board may, after satisfying certain notice requirements to Silicon
Labs, change its recommendation with respect to the Asset Sale, and Sigma can terminate the Agreement (and pay the $11.5 million
termination fee to Silicon Labs) in order to enter into a superior proposal, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so under certain circumstances specified in the Agreement would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law. Prior to taking these
actions, the Company must provide Silicon Labs with a three business day period (and a subsequent two business day match period) in
which to negotiate with the Company, and agreed to negotiate with Silicon Labs in good faith, in order to amend the terms of the
proposed transaction such that the acquisition proposal no longer constitutes a superior proposal.
 

In addition, prior to shareholder approval of the Asset Sale, the Company Board may change its recommendation with respect to
the Asset Sale for a reason unrelated to an acquisition proposal if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel) that, in light of the occurrence of certain intervening events, the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law, provided that the Company Board gives Silicon Labs a three business day
period in which to negotiate with the Company so as to avoid such recommendation change.

Termination of the Agreement
 

The Agreement may be terminated and the Asset Sale abandoned by mutual written consent of Silicon Labs, Merger Sub and the
Company. In addition, the Agreement may be terminated by either party if:
 

 
● the Asset Sale has not been completed on or before the June 7, 2018, provided, that this right to terminate will not be

available to any party whose breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in the Agreement is the
primary cause of, or results in, the failure of the Asset Sale to be consummated on or before June 7, 2018;

 

 

● any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any legal
requirement that remains in effect (other than the application to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement of applicable
waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 or other antitrust legal requirements) or
order making illegal, permanently enjoining or otherwise permanently prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement, and such legal requirement or order has become final and nonappealable; or

 
 ● the required shareholder approval is not obtained at the special meeting.
 

The Agreement may be terminated by the Company if:
 

 

● prior to receipt of shareholder approval, the Company Board has made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (as
defined in the Agreement) to enter into a definitive, written agreement concerning a superior proposal; provided, that (A)
concurrently with such termination, the Company shall enter into such definitive, written agreement and (B) the Company
shall have paid any termination fees due pursuant to the Agreement; or

 

 

● there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub and such
breach is incapable of being cured by June 7, 2018 or, if curable, is not cured within twenty business days of the date the
Company gives Parent written notice of such breach or inaccuracy, provided that the Company shall not have a right to
terminate the Agreement, if, at the time of the delivery of such notice, the Company is in material breach of any of its
obligations under the Agreement.

 
The Agreement may be terminated by Silicon Labs if:

 

 

● prior to the receipt of the Company shareholder approval at the special meeting, (i) a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change shall have occurred, (ii) the Company shall have entered into, or publicly announced its intention to enter into, a
definitive, written agreement concerning a superior proposal, other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement, or (iii) the
Company shall have materially breached its obligations pertaining to the non-solicitation provisions of the Agreement
described in “The Agreement—Non-Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals; Change in Recommendation;” or

 

 

● there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company and such breach
is incapable of being cured by June 7, 2018, or, if curable, is not cured within twenty business days of the date Parent gives
the Company written notice of such breach or inaccuracy, provided that Parent shall not have a right to terminate the
Agreement, if, at the time of the delivery of such notice, Parent is in material breach of any of its obligations under the
Agreement.

 
Asset Sale Expenses and Termination Fees

 
Each party will generally pay its own fees and expenses in connection with the Asset Sale, whether or not the Asset Sale is

completed. However, the Company must pay Silicon Labs a termination fee of $11.5 million if:
 
 ● Silicon Labs terminates the Agreement in connection with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change;
 

 
● Silicon Labs terminates the Agreement after the Company enters into an acquisition agreement or publicly announces its

intention to enter into an acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal;
 

 
● Silicon Labs terminates the Agreement after the Company has materially breached the non-solicitation provisions in the

Agreement;
 
 ● the Company terminates the Agreement in order to enter into an acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal;

● if (i) after the date of the Agreement, but prior to the termination of the Agreement an alternative acquisition proposal by a
third party is publicly announced or otherwise becomes known (including any knowledge of any intention of any third party
to make such a proposal), (ii) thereafter, the Agreement is terminated because the closing did not occur before June 7, 2018 or
because the requisite shareholder approval was not obtained and (iii) within twelve months following the date of such
termination of the Agreement the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any acquisition of a
majority of the Company’s assets or equity interests which is ultimately consummated, or any such acquisition shall have
been consummated; or

 

 

● if the Agreement is terminated due to a breach of the Company’s representations, warranties or covenants (or because the
closing did not occur before June 7, 2018 or because the requisite shareholder approval was not obtained at a time when
Parent would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement due to a breach of the Company’s representations, warranties or
covenants) and within twelve months following the date of such termination of the Agreement the Company shall have
entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any acquisition of a majority of the Company’s assets or equity interests
which is ultimately consummated, or any such acquisition shall have been consummated.

 
Regulatory Matters (page 73) 
 

The Agreement provides that if required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, the Asset Sale cannot
be consummated until, among other things, notifications have been given and certain information has been furnished to the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice and all applicable waiting periods have expired or been terminated. The parties have determined
that such filings are not required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.
 
The Plan of Liquidation (page 86)
 

If the shareholders approve the Asset Sale and the Plan of Liquidation, the Company intends to file a Certificate of Election with
the Secretary of State of the State of California as soon as practicable. Upon the filing of a Certificate of Election with the Secretary of
State of the State of California, the winding up, liquidation and dissolution of the Company pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation will
commence. The Company intends to negotiate and consummate the sale of all of its assets, including the sale of its TV Business and
mobile Internet of Things business (“Mobile IoT Business”), pay, or make adequate provision for the payment of, all obligations and
claims against the Company (including the provision for payment of contingent or unknown claims), wind-up its affairs, and distribute
its remaining assets to its shareholders. We do not believe the divestiture of the TV Business will result in material cash proceeds to
Sigma; however, if we are able to divest this business, we expect that our operating expenses and liabilities will be reduced
significantly, and our revenue following the closing of the Asset Sale and the TV Divestiture will be reduced to substantially zero. We
do not expect the sale of our Mobile IoT Business, if we are successful in divesting this business, or the shutdown of this business to
be material to our operations or assets available for distribution to shareholders. On February 15, 2018, the Company closed the sale of
its business that offers a range of home networking solutions, including G.hn, HomePlug and HPNA technologies (the “Wired
Connectivity Business”) for $23.5 million, net of holdback amounts. After taxes, we received gross proceeds from the sale of the
Wired Connectivity Business of approximately $23.4 million. After we file a Certificate of Election with the Secretary of State of the
State of California, we will cease all business activities except and insofar as necessary, appropriate or desirable for liquidation of our
remaining assets and for the winding up of the Company.
 

The Company plans to distribute, in an initial distribution (with potential subsequent distributions thereafter), a portion of the net
proceeds from the Asset Sale, subject to a contingency reserve for costs and liabilities, after the filing of a Certificate of Election with
the Secretary of State of the State of California. The amount and timing of the distributions to shareholders will be determined by the
Company Board in its discretion, subject to the provisions of the Plan of Liquidation. On the bases described in this Proxy Statement,
the Company Board anticipates that the amount of the initial distribution to shareholders following the Asset Sale will be between
$230 and $250 million or $5.82 to $6.33 per share based on 39,499,507 shares outstanding as of February 26, 2018. Following the
initial distribution, the Company Board anticipates distributing up to an additional $10 million to shareholders, for aggregate total
distributions of $230 to $260 million or $5.82 to $6.58 per share based on 39,499,507 shares outstanding as of February 26, 2018,
although the amount ultimately distributed to shareholders may be less than anticipated as a result of the assumptions described
elsewhere in the proxy statement and unforeseen circumstances. Subsequent distributions from the sale of the Company’s remaining
assets will be made in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Company Board in its discretion in accordance with the
Plan of Liquidation. There can be no guarantee as to the timing and amount of distributions to shareholders, even if all of our
remaining assets are sold, because there are many factors, some of which are outside of our control, which could affect the timing of
such distributions. Shareholders will not know at the time of voting the amount of consideration they will receive. In addition, only
shareholders of record as of the record date for a distribution as determined by the Company Board will be entitled to receive that
distribution. If you are not a shareholder of record as of the record date for a distribution as determined by the Company Board, you
will not be entitled to receive that distribution.

If the shareholders do not approve the Plan of Liquidation, the Company will still seek to complete the Asset Sale, if the Asset
Sale is approved by the shareholders and the other conditions to closing set forth in the Agreement are satisfied or waived. In the event
the Asset Sale closes, the Company will have transferred a substantial amount of its operating assets to Silicon Labs. Given that the
Company is winding down its TV Business, it will have limited assets with which to generate revenue. With limited assets with which
to generate revenue and no Plan of Liquidation approved, the Company anticipates that it would use its cash to pay ongoing operating
expenses, and the Company Board would convene to determine whether to make any distributions to shareholders. The Company
Board would have to evaluate the alternatives available to the Company, including, among other things, remaining a publicly traded
company, the possibility of investing the cash received from the Asset Sale in another operating business or undertaking a going
private transaction.

Reasons for the Plan of Liquidation (page 86)
 

In considering whether the Company should liquidate and dissolve following the consummation of the Asset Sale, the Company
Board considered the terms of the Plan of Liquidation and the dissolution process under California law, as well as other available
strategic options, which included, among other things, remaining a publicly traded company, the possibility of investing the cash
received from the Asset Sale in another operating business or undertaking a going private transaction. As part of its evaluation
process, the Company Board considered the risks and timing of each strategic option available to the Company, and consulted with its
financial advisors, management and the Company’s legal counsel. In approving the Plan of Liquidation, the Company Board
considered a number of factors, including but not limited to, the factors in the section entitled “Proposal 2 – The Liquidation Proposal
– The Plan of Liquidation – Reasons for the Plan of Liquidation”.
 
Interests of Certain Persons in the Asset Sale and the Liquidation (page 95)
 

In considering the recommendation of the Company Board that the shareholders vote to approve the Asset Sale Proposal and the
Liquidation Proposal, shareholders should be aware that some of our current and former directors and executive officers have interests
in the Asset Sale that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of shareholders generally. Interests of these persons may be
different from or in addition to the interests of shareholders for the following reasons, among others:
 

 
● Each of our non-employee directors’ (other than Mr. Awsare) Company RSU awards are subject to certain accelerated vesting

rights in the event the closing date of either the Asset Sale or the Liquidation precedes the award’s scheduled vesting date.
 

 

● Each of our executive officers is party to an individual Executive Severance Agreement (as defined below) that provides for
equity award acceleration and other severance benefits in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment on the
closing date of the Asset Sale or during the 18 month period thereafter or if these agreements are not assumed by Silicon
Labs.

 
These interests are discussed in more detail in the section entitled “Proposal 1 – The Asset Sale—Interests of Certain Persons in the
Asset Sale” beginning on page 72 of this proxy statement. The members of the Company Board were aware of the different or
additional interests described in such section and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the
Agreement and the Asset Sale, and in recommending to our shareholders that the Asset Sale be approved.
 

The cash compensation payable to Mr. Awsare is subject to certain accelerated vesting rights in the event that the Liquidation
occurs during his first year of service on the Company Board. Additionally, the Company Board is reviewing executive officer
retention and incentive compensation related to the Liquidation but has not approved any such compensation as of the date of this
proxy statement. Finally, by approving the Plan of Liquidation, shareholders are approving the authorization of the Company Board to
pay our officers, directors and employees compensation or additional compensation in connection with the successful implementation
of the Plan of Liquidation. See the section entitled “Proposal 2 – The Liquidation Proposal – The Plan of Liquidation—Interests of
Certain Persons in the Liquidation” beginning on page 91 of this proxy statement .
 
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (page 101) 
 

If consummated, the Asset Sale will be a taxable transaction to the Company. Because of the tax attributes of the Company, it is
anticipated that the Company will utilize such tax attributes to substantially reduce the amount of U.S. federal income tax from the
Asset Sale, even taking into account limitations, if any, on the Company’s use of tax attributes in recently enacted U.S. federal income
tax legislation informally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Any subsequent asset sales will also be taxable transactions to the
Company, and the Company does not expect to have tax attributes remaining after the Asset Sale to reduce the amount of U.S. federal
income tax from any such subsequent sales. The determination of whether and to what extent the Company’s tax attributes will be
available, however, is highly complex and is based in part upon facts that will not be known until the completion of the Asset Sale.
Neither the Asset Sale nor any subsequent asset sales will be taxable to holders of Company Common Stock, although any distribution
made by the Company on Company Common Stock will be a taxable event to the holders of Company Common Stock. However, if
the Plan of Liquidation is approved and implemented, distributions made to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Plan
of Liquidation will generally be treated as made in payment in exchange for their shares of Company Common Stock. If the Plan of
Liquidation is not approved, our shareholders could, depending on their particular circumstances, incur an increased shareholder-level
U.S. federal income tax liability in the event that property (including cash from the Asset Sale) distributed to shareholders is
characterized as a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement.
 

See the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement for a
more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Asset Sale, any subsequent asset sales and any

distributions on Company Common Stock. The tax consequences to you of the Asset Sale, any subsequent asset sales and any
distributions on Company Common Stock will depend on your particular tax situation. You should consult your tax advisor for a
complete analysis of the U.S. federal, state, local or foreign tax consequences to you of the Asset Sale, any subsequent asset sales and
any distributions on Company Common Stock, including the consequences of recently enacted U.S. federal income tax legislation
informally referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Dissenters’ Rights (page 100) 
 

Under California law, holders of shares of Company Common Stock are not entitled to dissenters’ rights in connection with the
Asset Sale or the Plan of Liquidation.

 
Litigation relating to the Asset Sale and the Liquidation (page 100)

 
On March 15, 2018, a purported shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern

District of California against Sigma, certain members of the Company Board and Silicon Labs. The complaint seeks to enjoin the
proposed transactions or to rescind the transactions or award rescissory damages in the event the transactions are consummated.  For
additional information, see the section entitled “Litigation Relating to the Asset Sale and the Liquidation” beginning on page 100 of
this proxy statement.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING, THE ASSET SALE AND THE PLAN OF
LIQUIDATION

 
The following questions and answers briefly address some questions you may have regarding the special meeting, the Asset Sale

and the Plan of Liquidation. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a
shareholder of Sigma Designs, Inc. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the
annexes to this proxy statement and the documents referred to in this proxy statement. We encourage you to read this proxy statement,
including the annexes, in its entirety because it explains the proposed Asset Sale, the documents related to the Asset Sale, the Plan of
Liquidation and other related matters. In this proxy statement, the terms “Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours,” “us” and “Sigma” refer
to Sigma Designs, Inc. We refer to Silicon Laboratories Inc. as “Parent” or “Silicon Labs” and Seguin Merger Subsidiary, Inc. as
“Merger Sub.”
 

Questions Related to the Special Meeting
 
 Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement and proxy card?
 

 

A: You are receiving this proxy statement and proxy card because, as of February 26, 2018 (the “Record Date”), the
record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting, you owned
shares of our common stock, no par value (the “Company Common Stock”). We entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of December 7, 2017, by and among the Company, Silicon Labs and Merger Sub (the
“Agreement”). The parties had contemplated that Silicon Labs would acquire Sigma pursuant to the Merger if Sigma
was able to satisfy certain conditions, including the sale or shut down of Sigma’s television and set-top box business
(the “TV Divestiture”) and the amendment or termination of certain contracts pursuant to the Agreement. These
conditions were not satisfied and accordingly, the parties are proceeding with the Asset Sale.

 
Sigma will sell to Silicon Labs all of the assets which relate to Sigma’s Z-Wave business, including all of the equity
interest in certain of Sigma’s subsidiaries that are primarily engaged in the Z-Wave business, and Silicon Labs will
assume all of Sigma’s liabilities related to the Z-Wave business, for $240 million in cash (the “Consideration”),
payable at the closing (the “Asset Sale”).

 
In order to complete the Asset Sale, our shareholders must approve the Asset Sale Proposal (as defined below).

 
After completion of the Asset Sale, the Company plans a voluntary dissolution and liquidation pursuant to a Plan of
Liquidation (“Plan of Liquidation”). Our shareholders must approve the Plan of Liquidation before the Company
can start the process of dissolution and liquidation.

 
Our board of directors (the “Company Board”) is providing this proxy statement to give you information for use in
determining how to vote on the Asset Sale Proposal, the Liquidation Proposal and other related proposals submitted
to our shareholders at the special meeting. You should read this proxy statement and the annexes attached hereto
carefully. The enclosed proxy card and voting instructions allow you, as our shareholder, to have your shares voted
at the special meeting without attending the special meeting. Your proxy is being solicited on behalf of the Company
Board.

 
Your vote is very important. If you do not vote or do not instruct your broker, bank or nominee how to vote, it
will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Asset Sale Proposal and “AGAINST” the Liquidation
Proposal (as defined below). We encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible. 

 
 Q: What are shareholders being asked to vote on and why is this approval necessary?
 
 A: Shareholders are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
 

 
1. To consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the Asset Sale and the transactions contemplated by the

Agreement (the “Asset Sale Proposal”);
 

 
2. To consider and vote upon a proposal for the voluntary dissolution and liquidation of the Company pursuant to

the terms of a Plan of Liquidation (the “Liquidation Proposal”);
 
 3. To consider and vote upon a proposal to adjourn the special meeting to solicit additional votes to approve the

Asset Sale Proposal and the Liquidation Proposal, if necessary or appropriate (the “Adjournment Proposal”);

4. To consider and vote upon, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation to be paid to our current and
former named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Asset Sale or the Plan of
Liquidation (the “Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal”), as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in “Interests of Certain Persons in the Asset Sale and the Liquidation—Golden Parachute
Compensation” beginning on page 98 of this proxy statement.

 
Shareholder approval of the Asset Sale Proposal is required for completion of the Asset Sale. Shareholder approval
of the Liquidation Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal and the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal are not
required for completion of the Asset Sale. No other matters are intended to be brought before the special meeting by
Sigma. If the Asset Sale Proposal is not approved, the Company will not implement the Plan of
Liquidation. Shareholders will not know at the time of voting the amount of consideration they will receive. In
addition, only shareholders of record as of the record date for a distribution as determined by the Company Board
will be entitled to receive that distribution.

 
 Q: What do I need to do now?
 

 

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement, please vote your shares of
Company Common Stock as soon as possible so that your shares of Company Common Stock will be represented at
the special meeting. Please follow the instructions set forth on the proxy card or on the voting instruction form
provided by the record holder if your shares of Company Common Stock are held in “street name” through your
broker, bank or other nominee.

 
 Q: How do I cast my vote?
 

 

A: Before you vote, you should read this proxy statement in its entirety, including its annexes, and carefully consider
how the Asset Sale and the Liquidation affect you after consulting with your legal, tax, accounting, financial and
other advisors. Shareholders will not know at the time of voting the amount of consideration they will receive. In
addition, only shareholders of record as of the record date for a distribution as determined by the Company Board
will be entitled to receive that distribution.

 
In addition to voting in person at the special meeting, if you are the record holder of Company Common Stock, you
may submit a proxy as follows:

 

 

● By Internet. The web address and instructions for Internet proxy submission can be found on the enclosed proxy
card. Internet proxy submission via the web address indicated on the enclosed proxy card is available 24 hours a
day. If you choose to submit your proxy by Internet, then you do not need to return the proxy card. To be valid,
your Internet proxy must be received by 11:59 p.m. (U.S. Eastern Time) on the day preceding the special
meeting.

 

 

● By Telephone. The toll-free number for telephone proxy submission can be found on the enclosed proxy card.
Telephone proxy submission is available 24 hours a day. If you choose to submit your proxy by telephone, then
you do not need to return the proxy card. To be valid, your telephone proxy must be received by 11:59 p.m.
(U.S. Eastern Time) on the day preceding the special meeting.

 

 
● By Mail. Mark the enclosed proxy card, sign and date it, and return it in the postage-paid envelope we have

provided. To be valid, your proxy by mail must be received by 11:59 p.m. (U.S. Eastern Time) on the day
preceding the special meeting.

 
We request that shareholders submit their proxies over the Internet, by telephone or by completing and signing the
accompanying proxy and returning it as soon as possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. When the
accompanying proxy is returned properly executed (including proper proxy submission by Internet or telephone), the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by it will be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the
instructions contained on the proxy card.

 
If you sign and return your proxy without indicating how to vote on any particular proposal, the Company Common
Stock represented by your proxy will be voted “FOR” the Asset Sale Proposal, “FOR” the Liquidation Proposal,
“FOR” the Adjournment Proposal and “FOR” the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal.

If you hold your shares in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank or nominee,
you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares in accordance with
the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or nominee. If you do not provide your broker, bank or
nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares, it will not be permitted to vote your shares. These are referred
to generally as “broker non-votes.” A broker non-vote occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner
returns a valid proxy but does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary
voting authority and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. Also, please note that if
your shares are held in “street name” and you wish to vote at the special meeting in person, you must bring to the
special meeting a legal proxy from the record holder of the shares (your broker, bank or nominee) authorizing you to
vote at the special meeting.

 Q: When and where is the special meeting?
 

 
A: The special meeting of shareholders will convene at 9:00 a.m. on April 17, 2018, at 47467 Fremont Blvd., Fremont,

California 94538.
 
 Q: Who can vote or submit a proxy to vote and attend the special meeting?
 

 

A: All holders of record of Company Common Stock as of the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to
receive notice of, and to attend and vote or submit a proxy to vote at, the special meeting. If your shares are held of
record in an account at a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, such firm, bank or nominee is considered the
holder of record of your shares and will forward the proxy and materials to you with a voting instruction form
explaining how to vote your shares. If you want to attend the special meeting and your shares are held in “street
name” through your broker, bank or other nominee, then you must bring to the special meeting a legal proxy from
the record holder of the shares (your broker, bank or nominee) authorizing you to vote at the special meeting.

 
 Q: How does the Company Board recommend that I vote?
 
 A: The Company Board unanimously recommends that you vote:
 
 ● “FOR” the Asset Sale Proposal,
 
 ● “FOR” the Liquidation Proposal,
 
 ● “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal, and
 
 ● “FOR” the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal.
 

Shareholders will not know at the time of voting the amount of consideration they will receive. In addition, only
shareholders of record as of the record date for a distribution as determined by the Company Board will be entitled
to receive that distribution.

 
 Q: What vote is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal?
 

 
A: The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock, present in person or represented by

proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter, is required to approve the Adjournment
Proposal, whether or not a quorum is present.

 
 Q: What vote is required to approve the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal?
 

 

A: Assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock, present
in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter, is required to
approve the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal. The vote regarding the Golden Parachute Compensation
Proposal is an advisory vote, and therefore, is not binding on Sigma, the Company Board or our compensation
committee. Since compensation and benefits that may be paid or provided are based on contractual arrangements
with the current and former executive officers, the outcome of this advisory vote will not affect the obligation to
make these payments and these payments may still be made even if our shareholders do not approve, by non-
binding, advisory vote, the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal.

 
 Q: How many votes am I entitled to cast for each share of Company Common Stock I own?
 

 
A: For each share of Company Common Stock that you owned on the Record Date, you are entitled to cast one vote on

each matter to be voted upon at the special meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 39,499,507 shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote.

 
 Q: What constitutes a quorum?
 
 A: The presence in person or by proxy of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding and entitled

to vote on the Record Date is required for a quorum at the special meeting. Both abstentions and broker non-votes
are counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, but broker non-votes are not counted

as shares entitled to vote so they will not be counted towards the tabulation of votes cast on proposals presented to
shareholders.

Q: What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote on the proposals or instruct my broker to vote on the

proposals?
 

 

A: If you indicate on your proxy that you abstain from voting on a proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote
against the Asset Sale Proposal, against the Liquidation Proposal, against the Adjournment Proposal and against the
Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal. If you fail to cast your vote, in person or by proxy, or fail to give voting
instructions to your broker, bank or nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote against the Asset Sale Proposal
and the Liquidation Proposal and it will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal or the Golden Parachute
Compensation Proposal.

 
 Q: When should I submit my proxy?
 
 A: You should submit your proxy as soon as possible so that your shares will be voted at the special meeting.
 
 Q: Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?
 

 
A: Yes. If you were a shareholder of record on the Record Date, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote,

unless noted below, at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting. You can do this in one of three
ways:

 

 
● delivering to our Secretary a signed written notice of revocation, bearing a date later than the date of the proxy,

stating that the proxy is revoked (written revocations may be sent to Sigma Designs, Inc., Attn: Elias Nader,
Secretary, 47467 Fremont Blvd., Fremont, California 94538);

 

 
● signing and delivering a new proxy, relating to the same shares and bearing a later date than the original proxy;

or
 

 
● attending the special meeting and voting in person (although attendance at the special meeting will not, by

itself, revoke a proxy).
 

If you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, you must follow the directions provided
by your broker, bank or other nominee to change those instructions.

 
 Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 

 

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and
multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage
account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If
you are a holder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one
proxy card.

 
In order to ensure that all of your shares are voted at the special meeting, please complete, sign, date and return each
proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive

 

 
Q. What happens if I sell my shares of Company Common Stock after the Record Date but before the special

meeting?
 

 

A. The Record Date for shareholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than both the date of the special
meeting and the consummation of the Asset Sale. If you transfer your shares of Company Common Stock after the
Record Date but before the special meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made
between you and the person to whom you transfer your shares and each of you notifies the Company in writing of
such special arrangements, you will retain your right to vote such shares at the special meeting.

 
Questions Related to the Asset Sale

 
 Q: Are there risks related to the Asset Sale?
 
 A Yes. You should carefully review the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 18 of this proxy statement.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790715/000143774918004982/sigm20180316_defm14a.htm 33/323

 Q: How will the Asset Sale affect outstanding equity awards held by our directors, executive officers and
employees?

 

 

A: Silicon Labs will not purchase, continue, substitute or assume any option to purchase Company Common Stock
(each, a “Company Option”), restricted stock unit convertible into a share of Company Common Stock (each, a
‘‘Company RSU’’) or other Company equity award. All Company equity awards will remain awards with respect to
Company Common Stock and will generally remain subject to their existing terms and conditions. However, the
outstanding Sigma equity awards may be affected by the Asset Sale.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790715/000143774918004982/sigm20180316_defm14a.htm 34/323

 
 

Certain Company equity awards may automatically accelerate in vesting as disclosed in “Interests of Certain
Persons in the Asset Sale and the Liquidation—Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 98 of this
proxy statement. Certain Company Options and Company RSUs, including awards held by current and former
officers and directors of the Company, are subject to previously negotiated single- and/or double-trigger acceleration
agreements providing for automatic vesting acceleration upon a Company change in control (or similar term, as
defined in the applicable agreement) or upon an involuntary termination (as defined in the applicable agreement) in
connection with a Company change in control. The Asset Sale will constitute a change in control under certain such
agreements.

 
Certain Company equity awards may be accelerated in vesting at the discretion of the compensation committee of
the Company Board. The Company’s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan and 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively, the
“Stock Incentive Plans”) reserve the ability of the Company to amend outstanding equity awards in a manner not
materially adverse to the holders thereof. The compensation committee of the Company Board has not determined to
amend any awards to provide for vesting acceleration, but may determine it appropriate to do so in connection with
the consummation of the Asset Sale or changes in employment or other service status that may occur due to the
Asset Sale.

 
Certain Company equity awards may become forfeited or terminated in the ordinary course as a result of holder
service separations. The Company Options and Company RSUs generally provide for all unvested options and units
to be immediately forfeited to the Company upon a termination from service (as an employee, consultant and/or
director, as applicable). The Company Options generally provide for all vested options to terminate three months
after a termination from service to the Company. Certain holders of Company Options and Company RSUs may
terminate from service to the Company in connection with the Asset Sale.

 
 Q: When do you expect the Asset Sale to be completed?
 

 
A: We are working toward completing the Asset Sale as quickly as possible and expect to complete the Asset Sale early

in the second calendar quarter of 2018, contingent upon receiving the requisite shareholder approval.
 
 Q: Why is the Company Board recommending that I vote “FOR” the Asset Sale Proposal?
 

 

A: After careful consideration, the Company Board unanimously determined that the Asset Sale, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement, is fair to, and in the best interests of, Sigma and its shareholders
and unanimously approved and declared advisable the Asset Sale and the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement. In reaching its decision to approve the Asset Sale and the transactions contemplated by the Agreement
and, to recommend to our shareholders the approval of the Asset Sale Proposal, the Company Board consulted with
our management, as well as our legal and financial advisors, and considered the terms of the Agreement. The
Company Board also considered each of the items set forth under “Proposal 1 – The Asset Sale Proposal – The Asset
Sale—Recommendation of the Company Board; Reasons for the Asset Sale” beginning on page 58 of this proxy
statement.

 

 
Q: Do any of Sigma’s directors or executive officers have interests in the Asset Sale that may differ from those of

the shareholders?
 

 

A: Yes. Our current and former directors and executive officers have interests in the Asset Sale that are different from,
or in addition to, the interests of the shareholders. See the section entitled “Proposal 1 – The Asset Sale Proposal –
The Asset Sale—Interests of Certain Persons in the Asset Sale” beginning on page 72 of this proxy statement. The
members of the Company Board were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating
the Agreement and the Asset Sale and in recommending that the shareholders vote to approve the Asset Sale.

 
 Q: What vote is required to approve the Asset Sale Proposal?
 

 

A: Approval of the Asset Sale Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. The obligations of the Company and
Silicon Labs to complete the Asset Sale are also subject to the satisfaction or waiver of several other conditions as
set forth in the Agreement. If you do not vote or do not instruct your broker, bank or nominee how to vote, it will
have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Asset Sale Proposal. Shareholders will not know at the time of
voting the amount of consideration they will receive. In addition, only shareholders of record as of the record date
for a distribution as determined by the Company Board will be entitled to receive that distribution.

 Q: Are there dissenters’ rights in connection with the Asset Sale?
 

 
A: No. Under California law, holders of shares of Company Common Stock are not entitled to dissenters’ rights. See

the section entitled “Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 100 of this proxy statement.
 
 Q: What are the tax consequences of the Asset Sale?
 

 

A: If consummated, the Asset Sale will be a taxable transaction to the Company. Because of the tax attributes of the
Company, it is anticipated that the Company will utilize such tax attributes to substantially reduce the amount of
U.S. federal income tax from the Asset Sale, even taking into account limitations, if any, on the Company’s use of
tax attributes in recently enacted U.S. federal income tax legislation informally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Any subsequent asset sales will also be taxable transactions to the Company, but the Company does not expect to
have tax attributes remaining after the Asset Sale to reduce the amount of U.S. federal income tax from any such
subsequent sales. The determination of whether and to what extent the Company’s tax attributes will be available,
however, is highly complex and is based in part upon facts that will not be known until the completion of the Asset
Sale. Neither the Asset Sale nor any subsequent asset sales will be taxable to holders of Company Common Stock,
although any distribution made by the Company on Company Common Stock will be a taxable event to the holders
of Company Common Stock. If the Plan of Liquidation is approved and implemented, distributions made to holders
of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation will generally be treated as made in exchange for
their shares of Company Common Stock. If the Plan of Liquidation is not approved, our shareholders could,
depending on their particular circumstances, incur an increased shareholder-level U.S. federal income tax liability in
the event that property (including cash from the Asset Sale) distributed to shareholders is characterized as a dividend
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”
beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement.

 
You should read “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement
for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Asset Sale, any subsequent asset
sales and any distributions on the Company Common Stock.

 
Because individual circumstances may differ, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular U.S.
federal, state, local or foreign tax consequences to you of the Asset Sale, any subsequent asset sales and any
distributions on Company Common Stock, including the consequences of recently enacted U.S. federal income tax
legislation informally referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

 
 Q: What happens if the Asset Sale is not approved by shareholders or is not completed for any other reason?
 

 

A: If our shareholders do not approve the Asset Sale Proposal or if the Asset Sale is not completed for any other reason,
we would continue to operate our Z-Wave business as we have done historically. We may also attempt to find
another buyer for that business or our company as a whole. Under specified circumstances, we may be required to
pay Silicon Labs a termination fee of up to $11.5 million as described in “Proposal 1 -  The Asset Sale Proposal—
The Asset Sale Agreement—Asset Sale Expenses and Termination Fees” beginning on page 83 of this proxy
statement.

 
If the Asset Sale is not completed, we may explore other potential transactions involving our Z-Wave business or all
or part of the entire Company. The terms of an alternative transaction may be more or less favorable to us than the
terms of the Asset Sale and there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach agreement with or complete an
alternative transaction with another party.

 
Questions Related to the Plan of Liquidation
 
 Q: What will happen under the Plan of Liquidation?
 
 A: Under the Plan of Liquidation, upon obtaining shareholder approval of the Liquidation Proposal, we will file a

Certificate of Election with the Secretary of State of the State of California, our jurisdiction of incorporation, to
commence the process of liquidation and dissolution. The Company will then cease its business activities (except as
necessary, appropriate or desirable to effect a sale of its remaining assets, including its TV Business and Mobile IoT
Business), negotiate and consummate the sale of all of its assets and properties, pay, or make adequate provision for
the payment of, all obligations and claims against the Company (including the provision for payment of contingent
or unknown claims), wind-up its affairs, and distribute its remaining assets, if any, to its shareholders. Once the

Company has been completely wound up without court proceeding therefor, the Company shall file a Certificate of
Dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of California.

 Q: What will happen if shareholders approve the Asset Sale but do not approve the Plan of Liquidation?
 

 

A: If shareholders do not approve the Plan of Liquidation, Sigma will still seek to complete the Asset Sale, assuming
the other conditions to closing set forth in the Agreement are satisfied or waived. In that event, Sigma will have
transferred a substantial portion of its operating assets to Silicon Labs and will have limited operations with which to
generate revenue. With limited assets with which to generate revenue and no Plan of Liquidation approved, Sigma
anticipates that it would use its cash to pay ongoing operating expenses, and the Company Board would convene to
determine whether to make any distributions to the shareholders. The Board would have to evaluate the alternatives
available to Sigma, including, among other things, remaining a publicly traded company, the possibility of investing
the cash received from the Asset Sale in another operating business or undertaking a going private transaction. In the
event we make a distribution outside of the Plan of Liquidation, our shareholders could, depending on their
particular circumstances, incur an increased shareholder-level U.S. federal income tax liability in the event that
property (including cash from the Asset Sale) distributed to shareholders is characterized as a dividend for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. See the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning
on page 101 of this proxy statement.

 
  Q: What will happen if the Plan of Liquidation is approved but the Asset Sale is not completed?
 

 
A: The effectiveness of the Plan of Liquidation is conditioned on the consummation of the Asset Sale. If the Asset Sale

does not occur, the Liquidation will not occur, unless the Company Board subsequently determines to proceed with
the liquidation of Sigma pursuant to an alternative transaction or plan.

 
 Q: What are the tax consequences of the Liquidation to shareholders?
 

 

A: If the Plan of Liquidation is approved and implemented, distributions made to holders of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation will generally be treated as made in exchange for their shares of Company
Common Stock. A Company shareholder holding Company Common Stock as a capital asset (generally, property
held for investment), will realize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the amount of
money and the fair market value of property (other than money) distributed to the shareholder, and (ii) the
shareholder’s tax basis in the Company Common Stock. Any gain or loss so realized generally would be long-term
capital gain or loss if the shareholder has held the Company Common Stock for more than one year. See the section
entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 101 of this proxy statement.

 

 
Q. What will happen to the Company’s remaining business once we file the Certificate of Election with the

Secretary of State of the State of California?
 

 

A. After we file our Certificate of Election with the Secretary of State of the State of California, we will cease all of the
Company’s business activities and withdraw the Company from any jurisdiction in which it is qualified to do
business, except and insofar as necessary, appropriate or desirable for liquidation of its assets and for the winding up
of the Company, including the winding down of our TV Business and Mobile IoT Business. This process may take
up to 12 months or more as we honor certain supply commitments to customers, if we are not successful in divesting
our remaining businesses. The Company will seek to consummate the sales of its remaining businesses on terms
most beneficial to the Company and its shareholders.

 

 
Q: If the Plan of Liquidation proposal is approved, what does the Company estimate that the holders of

Company Common Stock will receive?
 
 A: The total amount of cash or other property that may ultimately be distributed to the holders of Company Common

Stock is not yet known. There are many factors that may affect the amounts available for distribution to holders of
Company Common Stock including, among other things, the amount of taxes, employee costs (including severance
payments), transaction fees, expenses relating to the dissolution, unanticipated or contingent liabilities arising
hereafter and the proceeds we may receive from the sale of our remaining assets, including our TV Business, Mobile
IoT Business and other remaining assets, if any. We do not believe the divestiture of the TV Business will result in
material cash proceeds to Sigma; however, if we are able to divest this business, we expect that our operating
expenses and liabilities will be reduced significantly, and our revenue following the closing of the Asset Sale and the
TV Divestiture will be reduced to substantially zero. We do not expect the sale of our Mobile IoT Business, if we are
successful in divesting this business, or the shutdown of this business to be material to our operations or assets
available for distribution to shareholders. No assurance can be given as to the amounts holders of Company
Common Stock will ultimately receive. If Sigma has underestimated its existing obligations and liabilities or if

unanticipated or contingent liabilities arise, the amount ultimately distributed to the holders of Company Common
Stock could be less.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sigma expects to receive gross proceeds of approximately $236.5 million from the
Asset Sale. Subject to satisfaction of and compliance with existing contractual obligations, and appropriate reserves,
Sigma intends to distribute a portion of the net proceeds from the Asset Sale to its shareholders as part of the
Liquidation in one or more liquidating distributions. The amount and timing of the distributions to shareholders will
be determined by the Company Board in its discretion, subject to the provisions of the Plan of Liquidation. On the
bases described in this proxy statement, the Company Board anticipates that the amount of the initial distribution to
shareholders following the Asset Sale will be between $230 and $250 million or $5.82 to $6.33 per share based on
39,499,507 shares outstanding as of February 26, 2018. Following the initial distribution, the Company Board
anticipates distributing up to an additional $10 million to shareholders, for aggregate total distributions of $230 to
$260 million or $5.82 to $6.58 per share based on 39,499,507 shares outstanding as of February 26, 2018, although
the amount ultimately distributed to shareholders may be less than anticipated as a result of the assumptions
described elsewhere in the proxy statement and unforeseen circumstances.

 
On February 15, 2018, we closed the sale of our Wired Connectivity Business for $23.5 million, net of holdback
amounts. After taxes, we received gross proceeds from the sale of the Wired Connectivity Business of
approximately $23.4 million. Subsequent distributions will be made in such amounts and at such times as
determined by the Company Board in its discretion in accordance with the Plan of Liquidation.

 

 
Q: Do any of Sigma’s directors or executive officers have interests in the Liquidation that may differ from those

of the shareholders?
 

 

A: The cash compensation payable to our director, Mr. Awsare, is subject to certain accelerated vesting rights in the
event that the Liquidation occurs during his first year of service on the Company Board. Additionally, the Company
Board is reviewing retention and incentive compensation related to the Liquidation but has not approved any such
compensation as of the date of this proxy statement. Finally, by approving the Plan of Liquidation, shareholders are
approving the authorization of the Company Board to pay our officers, directors and employees compensation or
additional compensation in connection with the successful implementation of the Plan of Liquidation. See the
section entitled “Proposal 2 – The Liquidation Proposal – The Plan of Liquidation—Interests of Certain Persons in
the Liquidation” beginning on page 91 of this proxy statement.

 

 
Q: Will I still be able to sell my shares of Company Common Stock following shareholder approval of the Plan of

Liquidation?
 

A: Yes, but only until the Company files the Certificate of Dissolution. If the Liquidation Proposal is approved by
Sigma shareholders and the Plan of Liquidation is put into effect, Sigma intends to file the Certificate of Dissolution
with the Secretary of State of the State of California as soon as practicable after the complete wind up of the
Company without court proceeding therefor. From and after the end of trading on the date Sigma files the Certificate
of Dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of California, Sigma will close its stock transfer books and
discontinue recording transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. Thereafter, certificates representing shares of
Company Common Stock will not be assignable or transferable on Sigma’s books. Sigma will not retain a transfer
agent following the date of filing the Certificate of Dissolution. In addition, the Company will likely deregister its
common stock, and suspend its periodic reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”). However, given the expense and resource demands of being a public company,
Sigma may decide to “go dark,” or cease filing periodic reports with the SEC, by deregistering our securities sooner.
This will result in a substantial decrease in disclosure by us of our operations and prospects, and could substantially
decrease the liquidity and value of the Company Common Stock.

 
 Q: Who can help answer my questions?

RISK FACTORS
 

You should carefully consider the risk factors described below and those risk factors generally associated with our business
contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 28, 2017 and our subsequent filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), along with other information provided to you in this proxy statement in deciding how to vote on
the proposals to approve the Asset Sale and the Plan of Liquidation.  See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page
108 of this proxy statement.  The risks described below are not the only risks we face.  Additional risks not presently known to us or
that we currently believe are immaterial may also impact our business operations.  If any of the following risks occur, our business,
financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the market price of our common stock may decline,
and you may lose all or part of your investment.
 
Risks Related to the Asset Sale
 
The proposed Asset Sale is subject to a number of conditions beyond our control. Failure to complete the Asset Sale could
materially and adversely affect our future business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.
 

The closing of the Asset Sale is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of our shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of other
closing conditions, including performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Agreement.
 

We cannot predict whether and when the conditions will be satisfied. If one or more of these conditions is not satisfied, and as a
result, we do not complete the Asset Sale, or in the event the Asset Sale is not completed or is delayed for any other reason, our
business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price may be harmed because:
 

 
● management’s and our employees’ attention may be diverted from our day-to-day operations as they focus on matters related

to the Asset Sale;
 

 
● we could potentially lose key employees if such employees experience uncertainty about their future roles with us and decide

to pursue other opportunities in light of the Asset Sale;
 
 ● we could potentially lose customers or vendors, and new customer or vendor contracts could be delayed or decreased;
 

 

● we have agreed to restrictions in the Agreement that limit how we conduct our business prior to the closing if the Asset Sale,
including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to make certain capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions,
sell, transfer or dispose of our assets, enter into material contracts outside of the ordinary course of business, amend our
organizational documents and incur indebtedness; these restrictions may not be in our best interests as an independent
company and may disrupt or otherwise adversely affect our business and our relationships with our customers, prevent us
from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities, limit our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures,
industry developments and future opportunities, and otherwise harm our business, financial results and operations;

 

 
● we have incurred and expect to continue to incur expenses related to the Asset Sale, such as legal, financial advisory and

accounting fees, and other expenses that are payable by us whether or not the Asset Sale is completed;
 

 
● we may be required to pay a termination fee of $11.5 million to Silicon Labs if the Agreement is terminated under certain

circumstances, which would negatively affect our financial results and liquidity;
 

 
● activities related to the Asset Sale and related uncertainties may lead to a loss of revenue and market position that we may not

be able to regain if the Asset Sale does not occur; and
 

 
● the failure to, or delays in, consummating the Asset Sale may result in a negative impression of us with customers, potential

customers or the investment community.
 

The occurrence of these or other events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and stock price.
 

In addition, our stock price may fluctuate significantly based on announcements by us, Silicon Labs or other third parties
regarding the Asset Sale or our business.

The Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer.
 

The Agreement contains “no solicitation” provisions that restrict our ability to solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage, facilitate
or induce third party proposals for the acquisition of our common stock or to pursue an unsolicited offer, subject to certain limited
exceptions. In addition, Silicon Labs has an opportunity to modify the terms of the Asset Sale in response to any competing
acquisition proposals before the Company Board may withdraw or change its recommendation with respect to the Asset Sale. Upon
the termination of the Agreement to pursue an alternative transaction, including in connection with a “superior proposal”, we will be
required to pay $11.5 million as a termination fee. These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer from considering
or proposing an acquisition transaction, even if it were prepared to pay a higher price than what would be received in the Asset Sale,
or propose to acquire our entire company. These provisions might also result in a potential third-party acquirer proposing to pay a
lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become
payable. If the Agreement is terminated and we determine to seek another purchaser for our Z-Wave business or another business
combination, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the
Asset Sale.
 
Our current and former executive officers and directors have interests in the Asset Sale that may be different from, or in addition
to, the interests of our shareholders generally.
 

Our current and former executive officers and members of the Company Board may be deemed to have interests in the Asset Sale
that may be different from or in addition to those of our shareholders, generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of
interest. The Company Board was aware of these potentially differing interests and considered them, among other matters, in
evaluating and negotiating the Agreement and in reaching its decision to approve the Agreement and the transactions thereunder.
These interests relate to or arise from, among other things:
 

 
● the acceleration of equity awards and payment of severance benefits to our current and former executive officers pursuant to

executive severance agreements in the event of certain qualifying terminations of employment on the closing date of the
Asset Sale or during the 18 months thereafter or if those severance agreements are not assumed by Silicon Labs; and;

 

 
● the acceleration of vesting of Company RSU awards held by certain directors in the event the closing date of the Asset Sale

precedes the awards’ scheduled vesting dates
 
We will incur significant costs in connection with the Asset Sale, whether or not it is consummated.
 

We have and will continue to incur substantial expenses related to the Asset Sale, whether or not it is completed. We recorded
transaction-related costs of $2.1 million through February 3, 2018, and we anticipate incurring additional costs and expenses until
completion of the Asset Sale. In addition, we will incur additional financial advisory fees that are payable upon consummation of the
Asset Sale. Finally, we may also be required to pay $11.5 million to Silicon Labs if we terminate the Agreement in certain
circumstances. Payment of these expenses by us as a standalone entity would adversely affect our operating results and financial
condition and would likely adversely affect our stock price.
 
We cannot be sure if or when the Asset Sale will be completed.
 

The consummation of the Asset Sale is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the approval of the
Asset Sale by our shareholders. We cannot guarantee that the closing conditions set forth in the Agreement will be satisfied. If we are
unable to satisfy the closing conditions in Silicon Labs’ favor or if other mutual closing conditions are not satisfied, Silicon Labs will
not be obligated to complete the Asset Sale.
 

If the Asset Sale is not completed, the Company Board, in discharging its fiduciary obligations to our shareholders, may evaluate
other strategic alternatives that may be available, which alternatives may not be as favorable to our shareholders as the Asset Sale.
These may include retaining and operating the Z-Wave Business or pursuing an alternate sale transaction that would yield reduced
consideration or involve significant delays. Any future sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company or other transactions may
be subject to further shareholder approval.
 
We cannot predict the timing, amount or nature of any distributions to our shareholders.
 

If the Asset Sale closes, we currently expect to make a preliminary distribution of between $230 and $250 million or $5.82 to
$6.33 per share based on 39,499,507 shares outstanding as of February 26, 2018. Following the initial distribution, the Company
Board anticipates distributing up to an additional $10 million to shareholders, for aggregate total distributions of $230 to $260 million
or $5.82 to $6.58 per share based on 39,499,507 shares outstanding as of February 26, 2018, although the amount ultimately



9/26/2019 ex_101753.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790715/000143774918004982/sigm20180316_defm14a.htm 45/323

distributed to shareholders may be less than anticipated as a result of the assumptions described elsewhere in the proxy statement and
unforeseen circumstances. The Company Board is unable to predict the timing, amount or nature of, or the record date for, this or any
other distribution, if any, to be made to our shareholders. If you are not a shareholder of record as of the record date for a distribution
as determined by the Company Board, you will not be entitled to receive that distribution.
 
If the Asset Sale is completed, our remaining business prospects would be limited and our stock price may decline.
 

If our shareholders approve the Asset Sale Proposal and the Asset Sale closes, we will have to continue to operate our remaining
business operations for some period of time despite the sale of assets that generate a significant portion of our revenue. In addition, we
are in the process of winding down our TV Business and Mobile IoT Business, and are looking to sell our TV Business and Mobile
IoT Business. We do not believe the divestiture of the TV Business will result in material cash proceeds to Sigma; however, if we are
able to divest this business, we expect that our operating expenses and liabilities will be reduced significantly, and our revenue
following the closing of the Asset Sale and the TV Divestiture will be reduced to substantially zero. We do not expect the sale of our
Mobile IoT Business, if we are successful in divesting this business, or the shutdown of this business to be material to our operations
or assets available for distribution to shareholders. Further, on February 15, 2018, we closed the sale of our Wired Connectivity
Business for $23.5 million, net of holdback amounts. As a result, we would have limited assets with which to generate revenue, our
business prospects would be limited and our stock price may decline. If the Asset Sale closes and the Liquidation Proposal is approved
at the special meeting, we expect to devote our attention to selling our remaining assets and winding down our operations in an orderly
manner.

Risks Related to the Plan of Liquidation
 
If our shareholders do not approve the Plan of Liquidation, our business could be harmed and our shareholders could face
adverse tax consequences.
 

If we do not obtain shareholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation, we would have to continue business operations despite the
sale of assets that generate a significant portion of our revenue, and our previously announced efforts to wind down our TV Business.
Assuming the completion of the Asset Sale and the winding down of our TV Business, we would have limited assets with which to
generate operating revenue and likely will have retained only those employees required to wind-up our remaining business. We do not
believe the divestiture of the TV Business will result in material cash proceeds to Sigma; however, if we are able to divest this
business, we expect that our operating expenses and liabilities will be reduced significantly, and our revenue following the closing of
the Asset Sale and the TV Divestiture will be reduced to substantially zero. We do not expect the sale of our Mobile IoT Business, if
we are successful in divesting this business, or the shutdown of this business to be material to our operations or assets available for
distribution to shareholders. Additionally, we may elect not to invest in another operating business following the closing of the Asset
Sale. Further, our shareholders could, depending on their particular circumstances, incur an increased shareholder-level U.S. federal
income tax liability in the event that property (including cash from the Asset Sale) distributed to shareholders is characterized as a
dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning
on page 101 of this proxy statement.

 
We cannot determine at this time the amount or timing of any distributions to our shareholders because there are many factors,
some of which are outside of our control, that could affect our ability to make such distributions.
 

On February 15, 2018, we closed the sale of our Wired Connectivity Business for $23.5 million, net of holdback amounts. After
taxes, we received gross proceeds from the sale of the Wired Connectivity Business of approximately $23.4 million. If the Asset Sale
is approved, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $231.5 million, after payment of transaction and other related
expenses, and certain taxes. Assuming the Plan of Liquidation is approved by shareholders, we plan to distribute, in an initial
distribution (with potential subsequent distributions thereafter), a portion of the net proceeds from the Asset Sale and the Company’s
other cash, subject to a contingency reserve for remaining costs and liabilities. The amount and timing of the distributions to
shareholders will be determined by the Company Board in its discretion, subject to the provisions of the Plan of Liquidation. The
Company Board anticipates that the amount of the initial distribution to shareholders following the Asset Sale will between $230 and
$250 million or $5.82 to $6.33 per share based on 39,499,507 shares outstanding as of February 26, 2018. Following the initial
distribution, the Company Board anticipates distributing up to an additional $10 million to shareholders, for aggregate total
distributions of $230 to $260 million or $5.82 to $6.58 per share based on 39,499,507 shares outstanding as of February 26, 2018,
although the amount ultimately distributed to shareholders may be less than anticipated as a result of the assumptions described
elsewhere in the proxy statement and unforeseen circumstances. Subsequent distributions will be made in such amounts and at such
times as determined by the Company Board in its discretion in accordance with the Plan of Liquidation. However, at this time, we
cannot determine when we will be able to make any distributions to our shareholders or the amount of any such distributions. Those
determinations depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, whether we are able to sell our remaining assets and the
prices therefor; the timing of the sale of our remaining assets; the amount we will be required to pay to satisfy unknown or contingent
liabilities in the future, including liabilities related to recently filed shareholder litigation related to the Asset Sale and the Liquidation;
the cost of operating our business through the date of our final dissolution; inaccuracies in the cost estimates to resolve currently
known contingent liabilities; general business and economic conditions; and other matters. With respect to the sale of the TV Business
and the Mobile IoT Business, the Company has and continues to pursue all strategic alternatives for each. We do not believe the
divestiture of the TV Business will result in material cash proceeds to Sigma; however, if we are able to divest this business, we
expect that our operating expenses and liabilities will be reduced significantly, and our revenue following the closing of the Asset Sale
and the TV Divestiture will be reduced to substantially zero. We do not expect the sale of our Mobile IoT Business, if we are
successful in divesting this business, or the shutdown of this business to be material to our operations or assets available for
distribution to shareholders. If shareholders do not approve the Plan of Liquidation, the Company intends to continue operating its
businesses until it is able to complete transactions that will maximize shareholder value or otherwise wind down these businesses in
accordance with existing commitments. There can be no assurance, however, as to the time it will take to complete such transactions
or wind down.
 

In addition, we will continue to incur claims, liabilities and expenses from operations (such as operating costs, salaries, directors’
and officers’ insurance, payroll and local taxes, legal and accounting fees and miscellaneous office expenses) as we seek to close the
Asset Sale and effect the Liquidation. Our estimates regarding our expense levels may be inaccurate. Any unforecasted or unexpected
claims, liabilities or expenses that arise between the date of this proxy statement and the liquidation and final dissolution of Sigma or
any claims, liabilities or expenses that exceed our estimates could leave us with less cash than is necessary to pay liabilities and
expenses and would likely reduce the amount of cash available for ultimate distribution to our shareholders. Further, if cash to be

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790715/000143774918004982/sigm20180316_defm14a.htm 47/323

received from the sale of our remaining assets, including the TV Business and the Mobile IoT Business, is not adequate to provide for
all of our obligations, liabilities, expenses and claims, we will not be able to distribute any amount at all to our shareholders.
 

For the foregoing reasons, there can be no assurance as to the timing and amount of distributions to our shareholders, even if all of
our remaining assets, including the TV Business and Mobile IoT Business, are sold; provided that the Company must complete the
distribution of all of its properties and assets to its shareholders as provided in the Plan of Distribution as soon as practicable following
the filing of the Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of California and in any event on or before the tenth
anniversary of such filing.

We may be unable to sell our remaining assets and our remaining lines of business at acceptable prices, or at all.
 

In order to maximize shareholder value and pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Liquidation, we presently intend to sell our
remaining assets and lines of businesses. However, we may not be able to find purchasers for such assets due to market conditions or
we may be unable to obtain acceptable value for these remaining assets and lines of business. As a result, we may be forced to attempt
to sell our remaining assets and lines of businesses at a time or at a value which is unfavorable to us which would delay or decrease
the potential liquidating distributions to our shareholders. We do not believe the divestiture of the TV Business will result in material
cash proceeds to Sigma; however, if we are able to divest this business, we expect that our operating expenses and liabilities will be
reduced significantly, and our revenue following the closing of the Asset Sale and the TV Divestiture will be reduced to substantially
zero. We do not expect the sale of our Mobile IoT Business, if we are successful in divesting this business, or the shutdown of this
business to be material to our operations or assets available for distribution to shareholders.  

 
If any of the parties to a future sale agreement default thereunder, or if a sale does not otherwise close, our liquidating
distributions to our shareholders may be delayed or reduced.
 

The consummation of any future potential sales transaction is subject to the satisfaction of applicable closing conditions. If the
transaction contemplated by the future sale agreement does not close because of a buyer default, failure of a closing condition or for
any other reason, we will need to locate a new buyer for the asset or line of business, which we may be unable to do promptly or at a
price or on terms that are as favorable as the failed transaction. We will also incur additional costs involved in locating a new buyer
and negotiating a new sale agreement for the applicable asset. These additional costs are not included in our projections. In the event
that we incur these additional costs, our liquidating distributions to our shareholders would be delayed or reduced.
 
The Company Board may abandon or delay implementation of the Plan of Liquidation even if it is approved by our shareholders.
 

The Company Board has adopted and approved a Plan of Liquidation for the Liquidation of Sigma following the closing of the
Asset Sale. Even if the Liquidation Proposal is approved by our shareholders, the Company Board has reserved the right, in its
reasonable discretion and subject to applicable law, to abandon or delay implementation of the Plan of Liquidation. Following
completion of the Asset Sale, we will continue to exist as a public company until we are dissolved. Although the Company Board has
no present intention to pursue any alternative to the Plan of Liquidation, the Company Board may conclude either that its fiduciary
obligations require it to pursue business opportunities that present themselves or that abandoning the Plan of Liquidation is otherwise
in our best interests and the best interests of our shareholders. If the Company Board elects to pursue any alternative to the Plan of
Liquidation, the value of our common stock may decline.
 
If we fail to create an adequate contingency reserve for payment of our expenses and liabilities, each of our shareholders who
receives liquidating distributions could be held liable for payment to our creditors of his or her pro rata share of amounts owed to
creditors in excess of the contingency reserve, up to the amount actually distributed to such shareholder in the Liquidation.
 

If the Plan of Liquidation is approved by our shareholders, we intend to file a Certificate of Election with the Secretary of State of
the State of California and then complete the wind down. We intend to then file a Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State
of the State of California to dissolve Sigma. Pursuant to California law, Sigma will continue to exist for a minimum of three years after
its dissolution becomes effective for the purpose of prosecuting and defending suits against Sigma and enabling Sigma and our
subsidiaries to close their business, to dispose of their property, to discharge their liabilities and to distribute to shareholders any
remaining assets. If a court holds at any time that we have failed to make adequate provision for our expenses and liabilities in the
Liquidation or if the amount ultimately required to be paid in respect of such liabilities exceeds the amount available from our
contingency reserve, our creditors could seek an injunction against the making of distributions on the grounds that the amounts to be
distributed are needed to provide for the payment of our expenses and liabilities. Any such action could delay or substantially diminish
the amount of any cash distributions to shareholders. If we fail to create an adequate contingency reserve for payment of our expenses
and liabilities, creditors could assert claims against each shareholder receiving a distribution for the payment of any shortfall, up to the
amounts previously received by the shareholder in distributions from us. In such event, a shareholder could be required to return all
distributions previously made to such shareholder pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and could receive nothing from us under the
Plan of Liquidation. Moreover, in the event a shareholder has paid taxes on amounts previously received by the shareholder, a
repayment of all or a portion of such amount could result in a shareholder incurring a net tax cost if the shareholder’s repayment of an
amount previously distributed does not cause a commensurate reduction in taxes payable. The Company Board is not required to
obtain a solvency opinion as a condition to authorizing a liquidating distribution and we cannot assure you that the contingency
reserve established by us will be adequate to cover all expenses and liabilities.

The tax treatment of any liquidating distributions may vary from shareholder to shareholder, and the discussion in this proxy
statement regarding such tax treatment are general in nature. You should consult your own tax advisor instead of relying on the
discussions of tax treatment in this proxy statement for tax advice.
 

We have not requested a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) with respect to the anticipated tax consequences of the
Liquidation, and we will not seek an opinion of counsel with respect to the anticipated tax consequences of any liquidating
distributions. If any of the anticipated tax consequences described in this proxy statement proves to be incorrect, the result could be
increased taxation at the corporate and/or shareholder level, thus reducing the benefit to our shareholders and us from the Liquidation
and distributions. Tax considerations applicable to particular shareholders may vary with and be contingent upon the shareholder’s
individual circumstances.
 
Shareholders may not be able to recognize a loss for federal income tax purposes until they receive a final distribution from us,
which may be three years after our dissolution and could be longer.
 

As a result of the Liquidation, for federal income tax purposes, shareholders will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference
between (a) the sum of the amount of cash distributed to them and the aggregate fair market value of any property distributed to them,
and (b) their tax basis for their shares of Company Common Stock. A shareholder’s tax basis in shares of Company Common Stock
will depend upon various factors, including the shareholder’s cost and the amount and nature of any distributions received with respect
thereto. Any loss generally will be recognized only when the final distribution from us has been received, which may be more than
three years after our dissolution, and if the shareholder is still the owner of the shares of Company Common Stock.
 
If we decide to use a liquidating trust, as permitted by the Plan of Liquidation, interests of our shareholders in such a trust would
not be transferable.
 

The interests of our shareholders in a liquidating trust set up by us under the approved Plan of Liquidation would not be
transferable, which could adversely affect your ability to realize the value of such interests. In addition, as shareholders will be
deemed for U.S. federal income tax purposes to have received a liquidating distribution from the Company equal to their pro rata share
of the value of the net assets transferred to the liquidating trust, the distribution by the Company of non-transferable interests could
result in tax liability to the former Company shareholders without such holders being readily able to realize the value of the distributed
interests to pay such taxes.
 
The Company Board may at any time turn management of our liquidation over to a third party, and some or all of our directors
may resign from the Company Board at that time.
 

Our board of directors may at any time turn our management over to a third party to complete the liquidation of our remaining
assets and distribute the available proceeds to our shareholders, and some or all of our directors may resign from the Company Board
at or before that time. If management is turned over to a third party and all of our directors resign, the third party would have sole
control over the liquidation process, including the sale or distribution of any remaining assets under the Plan of Liquidation, if
approved.
 
If we fail to retain the services of appropriate personnel, the Plan of Liquidation may not succeed.
 

The success of the Plan of Liquidation depends in part upon our ability to retain the services of qualified personnel who will be
charged with operating the Company following the closing of the Asset Sale until we are able to sell our remaining assets and
complete transactions for our remaining business. The retention of qualified personnel may be particularly difficult given that we
expect to liquidate the Company, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining the services of such qualified
personnel or that we will be able to retain the services of such qualified personnel for the amounts the Company is willing to pay for
such services. Our Compensation Committee is currently reviewing executive officer retention and incentive compensation related to
the Liquidation but has not approved any such compensation as of the date of this proxy statement. In addition, one of our directors is
entitled to the acceleration of payment of certain compensation payable in the event the Liquidation occurs before the entire amount of
the compensation is paid.
 
We will continue to incur claims, liabilities and expenses that will reduce the amount available for distribution to shareholders.
 

Claims, liabilities and expenses from operations (such as operating costs, salaries, directors’ and officers’ insurance, payroll and
local taxes, legal and accounting fees and miscellaneous office expenses) will continue to be incurred as we seek to close the Asset
Sale and wind down operations. These expenses will reduce the amount of assets available for ultimate distribution to shareholders. If
we incur obligations, liabilities, expenses and claims in excess of those we currently anticipate, the amount distributed to our
shareholders may be lower than we currently estimate.

Our stock transfer books will close on the date we file the Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of
California, after which it will not be possible for shareholders to trade our stock.
 

We will close our stock transfer books and discontinue recording transfers of our common stock at the close of business on the
date we file the Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of California. Thereafter, certificates or book entry
positions representing shares of Company Common Stock will not be assignable or transferable on the Company’s books. The
proportionate interests of all of our shareholders will be fixed on the basis of their respective stock holdings at the close of business on
the date of filing of the Certificate of Dissolution, and any distributions after such date made by the Company shall be made solely to
the shareholders of record at the close of business on the date of filing of the Certificate of Dissolution.
 
We will continue to incur the expenses of complying with public company reporting requirements.
 

Following the Asset Sale and through the subsequent liquidation and dissolution, we have an obligation to continue to comply
with the applicable reporting requirements of the Exchange Act even though compliance with these reporting requirements is
economically burdensome. Until we are able to deregister our shares and suspend our periodic reporting obligations under the
Exchange Act, we will remain a reporting issuer and will incur attendant costs relating to filing such reports with the SEC. We
currently intend to file the Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of California once the Company has been
completely wound up without court proceedings therefor. To the extent that we delay filing the Certificate of Dissolution, we would be
obligated to continue complying with the applicable reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. The expenses incurred by us in
complying with the applicable reporting requirements will reduce the assets available for ultimate distribution to our shareholders.
 
If we decide to “go dark” our stock price will decline and shareholders may lose access to a viable trading market.
 

Given the expense and resource demands of being a public company, we may decide to “go dark,” or cease filing periodic report
with the SEC. This will result in a substantial decrease in disclosure by us of our operations and prospects, and a substantial decrease
in the liquidity and value of the Company Common Stock. After we “go dark” our shares may still be quoted in the “Pink Sheets”, an
electronic interdealer quotation service, although there can be no assurance of this or that if such quotations begin they will continue
for any length of time. The Pink Sheets are not a stock exchange and we do not have the ability to list on, or control whether our
shares are quoted on Pink Sheets. Shareholders may still continue to trade our common stock in the OTC market, but liquidity and the
value of our common stock would likely be negatively affected.
 
Risks Related to the Asset Sale and the Liquidation
 
Recently filed litigation could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the Asset Sale and the Liquidation, and could
reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders in the Liquidation.

 
On March 15, 2018, a complaint captioned Ann Noys v. Sigma Designs, Inc., et al., Case No. 18-cv-01645-WHO was filed in the

United States District Court for the Northern District of California naming as defendants Sigma, certain members of the Company
Board and Silicon Labs. This action purports to be a class action brought by a shareholder alleging, among other things, that the
defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 14a-9 by filing a materially
incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement on February 23, 2018.  The complaint seeks, among other things, either to
enjoin the proposed transactions or to rescind the transactions or award rescissory damages in the event the transactions are
consummated. A preliminary injunction could delay or jeopardize the completion of the transactions, an adverse judgment granting
permanent injunctive relief could indefinitely enjoin completion of the transactions, and an award of rescissory damages could reduce
the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders in any liquidation that Sigma might undertake following the Asset Sale.

THE SPECIAL MEETING 
 
General 
 

Your proxy is solicited on behalf of the Company Board for use at our special meeting of shareholders to be held on April 17,
2018, at 9:00 a.m. local time, at 47467 Fremont Blvd., Fremont, California 94538, or at any continuation, postponement or
adjournment thereof, for the purposes discussed in this proxy statement and in the accompanying Notice of Special Meeting and any
business properly brought before the special meeting. Proxies are solicited to give all shareholders of record an opportunity to vote on
matters properly presented at the special meeting.
 
Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting 
 

We will hold the special meeting on April 17, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. local time, at 47467 Fremont Blvd., Fremont, California 94538.
On or about March 20, 2018, we commenced mailing this proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy to shareholders entitled to
vote at the special meeting.
 
Purpose of the Special Meeting 
 

At the special meeting, we are asking holders of record of the Company Common Stock on February 26, 2018, to consider and
vote on the following:
 
 1. the Asset Sale Proposal;
 
 2. the Liquidation Proposal;
 
 3. the Adjournment Proposal; and
 

 
4. the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section

entitled “Interests of Certain Persons in the Asset Sale and the Liquidation—Golden Parachute Compensation”
beginning on page 98 of this proxy statement.

 
Recommendation of the Company Board 
 

After careful consideration, the Company Board has unanimously determined that the Asset Sale on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Agreement, is fair to and in the best interests of Sigma and its shareholders. After such consideration, the
Company Board approved and declared advisable the Asset Sale and the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.
 

Further, after careful consideration, the Company Board has unanimously determined that the dissolution and liquidation of the
Company, pursuant to a Plan of Liquidation is in the best interest of Sigma and its shareholders. After such consideration, the
Company Board approved and declared advisable the Plan of Liquidation and the transactions contemplated therein.
 

Shareholders will not know at the time of voting the amount of consideration they will receive. In addition, only shareholders of
record as of the record date for a distribution as determined by the Company Board will be entitled to receive that distribution.
 

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and the Plan of Liquidation, the Company Board unanimously
recommends that our shareholders vote “FOR” the Asset Sale Proposal, “FOR” the Liquidation Proposal, “FOR” the
Adjournment Proposal and “FOR” the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal. See the section entitled “Proposal 1 – The
Asset Sale Proposal – The Asset Sale—Recommendation of the Company Board; Reasons for the Asset Sale” beginning on page
58 of this proxy statement and the section entitled “Proposal 2 – The Liquidation Proposal – The Plan of Liquidation—Reasons
for the Plan of Liquidation” beginning on page 86 of this proxy statement. 
 
Shareholders Entitled to Vote; Record Date 
 

You may vote at the special meeting if you were a record holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the close of business on
February 26, 2018, the Record Date. For each share of Company Common Stock that you owned on the Record Date, you are entitled
to cast one vote on each matter voted upon at the special meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 39,499,507 shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote.
 
Quorum and Vote Required 



9/26/2019 ex_101753.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790715/000143774918004982/sigm20180316_defm14a.htm 53/323

 
A quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold the special meeting. The required quorum for the transaction of business at the

special meeting shall exist when the holders of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at the special
meeting are represented either in person or by proxy. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that the special
meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies. Abstentions and “broker non-votes,” discussed below, count as shares present
for establishing a quorum. A “broker non-vote” occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner returns a valid proxy but
does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting authority and has not received
instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. Brokers, banks and other nominees will not have discretionary authority on the
Asset Sale Proposal, the Liquidation Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal or the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal.

You may vote “FOR” or “AGAINST,” or you may “ABSTAIN” from voting on, the Asset Sale Proposal. Approval of the Asset
Sale requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote at
the special meeting. Because the vote on the Asset Sale Proposal is based on the total number of shares outstanding, rather than the
number of actual votes cast, abstentions and “broker non-votes” will have the same effect as voting against the approval of the Asset
Sale Proposal.
 

You may vote “FOR” or “AGAINST,” or you may “ABSTAIN” from voting on, the Liquidation Proposal. Approval of the Plan
of Liquidation requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled
to vote at the special meeting. Because the vote on the Liquidation Proposal is based on the total number of shares outstanding, rather
than the number of actual votes cast, abstentions and “broker non-votes” will have the same effect as voting against the approval of the
Liquidation Proposal.
 

You may vote “FOR” or “AGAINST,” or you may “ABSTAIN” from voting on, the Adjournment Proposal. The Adjournment
Proposal will be approved if a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock, present in person or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote on the subject matter, vote in favor of the proposal, whether or not a quorum is present. Broker non-votes do not count
as shares that are entitled to vote so they will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal although abstentions will have the same
effect as a vote against that proposal.
 

You may vote “FOR” or “AGAINST,” or you may “ABSTAIN” from voting on, the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal.
The non-binding, advisory Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal will be approved if a majority of the shares of Company
Common Stock, present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter, vote in favor of the proposal.
Broker non-votes do not count as shares that are entitled to vote so they will have no effect on the Golden Parachute Compensation
Proposal, although abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against that proposal.
 

A list of our shareholders will be available for review for any purpose germane to the special meeting at 47467 Fremont Blvd.,
Fremont, California 94538 during regular business hours for a period of ten days before the special meeting and will also be available
at the special meeting.
 
Shares Owned by Our Directors and Executive Officers 
 

As of the Record Date, our current and certain former directors and executive officers were entitled to vote 1,142,751 shares of
Company Common Stock, or approximately 2.9% of Company Common Stock outstanding on that date. These numbers do not give
effect to outstanding Company Options or Company RSUs, none of which are entitled to vote at the special meeting. Certain of our
current and former directors and executive officers have entered into voting agreements obligating them to vote all of their shares of
Company Common Stock in favor of the Asset Sale Proposal and any other proposals necessary to consummate the Asset Sale.
 
Voting; Proxies 
 

For Shareholders of Record
 

If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the special meeting.
 

In addition to voting in person at the special meeting, if you are the record holder of your shares of common stock, you may
submit a proxy as follows:
 

 

● By Internet. The web address and instructions for Internet proxy submission can be found on the enclosed proxy card.
Internet proxy submission via the web address indicated on the enclosed proxy card is available 24 hours a day. If you choose
to submit your proxy by Internet, then you do not need to return the proxy card. To be valid, your Internet proxy must be
received by 11:59 p.m. (U.S. Eastern Time) on the day preceding the special meeting.

 

 

● By Telephone. The toll-free number for telephone proxy submission can be found on the enclosed proxy card. Telephone
proxy submission is available 24 hours a day. If you choose to submit your proxy by telephone, then you do not need to
return the proxy card. To be valid, your telephone proxy must be received by 11:59 p.m. (U.S. Eastern Time) on the day
preceding the special meeting.

 

 
● By Mail. Mark the enclosed proxy card, sign and date it, and return it in the postage-paid envelope we have provided. To be

We request that shareholders submit their proxies over the Internet, by telephone or by completing and signing the accompanying
proxy and returning it as soon as possible in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. When the accompanying proxy is returned properly
executed (including proper proxy submission by Internet or telephone), the shares of Company Common Stock represented by it will
be voted at the special meeting in accordance with the instructions contained on the proxy card.
 

If you sign and return your proxy without indicating how to vote on any particular proposal, the Company Common Stock
represented by your proxy will be voted “FOR” each proposal in accordance with the recommendation of the Company Board.
 

For Beneficial Owners 
 

If your shares of common stock are held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee, you have the right to direct your
broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares of Company Common Stock. Your broker, bank or other nominee, as
applicable, may establish an earlier deadline by which you must provide instructions to it for how to vote your shares. You should read
carefully the materials provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee. Because a beneficial owner is not the shareholder of
record, you may not vote these shares of Company Common Stock at the special meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from the
broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote such shares at the special meeting.
 
Revocation of Proxies 
 

If you are a shareholder of record, you may revoke your proxy, unless noted below, at any time before your proxy is voted at the
special meeting by taking any of the following actions:
 

 
● delivering to our Secretary a signed written notice of revocation, bearing a date later than the date of the proxy, stating that

the proxy is revoked;
 
 ● signing and delivering a new proxy, relating to the same shares and bearing a later date than the original proxy; or
 

 
● attending the special meeting and voting in person (although attendance at the special meeting will not, by itself, revoke a

proxy).
 

Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of proxies should be addressed to Sigma
Designs, Inc., 47467 Fremont Blvd., Fremont, California 94538, Attention: Elias Nader, Secretary.
 

If your shares are held in “street name,” you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank or
other nominee. You must contact your broker, bank or other nominee to find out how to do so. See above regarding how to vote in
person if your shares are held in street name.
 
Solicitation of Proxies 
 

The Company Board is soliciting proxies for the special meeting from our shareholders. We will bear the entire cost of soliciting
proxies from our shareholders. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by delivery of this proxy statement by mail, we will request
that brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of Company Common Stock which are beneficially owned by our
shareholders send Notices of Special Meeting, proxies and proxy materials to those beneficial owners and secure those beneficial
owners’ voting instructions. We will reimburse those record holders for their reasonable expenses. We have engaged D.F. King & Co.,
Inc., to assist in the solicitation of proxies and provide related advice and informational support for which we will pay a fee of $12,000
plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. We may also use several of our regular employees, who will not be specially
compensated, to solicit proxies from our shareholders, either personally or by telephone, Internet, facsimile or special delivery letter.
In addition, Sigma, Silicon Labs and their respective directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the
solicitation of proxies from Sigma’s shareholders in connection with the Asset Sale and the Plan of Liquidation. The interests of
Sigma’s directors and executive officers in connection with the Asset Sale is discussed in more detail in the section entitled “Interests
of Certain Persons in the Asset Sale and the Liquidation” beginning on page 95 of this proxy statement. Information regarding the
directors and executive officers of Silicon Labs is included in Silicon Labs’ proxy statement for its 2017 annual meeting of
shareholders, which was filed with the SEC on March 9, 2017.
 
Dissenters’ Rights
 

Dissenters’ rights are a statutory remedy available in many states to shareholders who object to certain extraordinary actions taken
by a corporation, such as mergers or certain other change of control transactions. This remedy typically allows dissenting shareholders
to require the corporation to buy their stock at a price equal to its fair value immediately before the extraordinary corporate action is

taken. Under California law, shareholders are not entitled to dissenters’ rights in connection with the Asset Sale or the Plan of
Liquidation.

Adjournments or Postponements 
 

The special meeting may be adjourned for the purpose of, among other things, soliciting additional proxies, by the vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock represented at the meeting, whether or not a quorum is present. Any
signed proxies received by us for which no voting instructions are provided on such matter will be voted “FOR” the Adjournment
Proposal.

PROPOSAL 1
THE ASSET SALE PROPOSAL

 
The Asset Sale Proposal
 

Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement that is described in this proxy statement and attached as Annex A, Sigma will sell to
Silicon Labs all of Sigma’s assets that relate to its Z-Wave Business, including all of Sigma’s equity interest in certain of its
subsidiaries engaged in the Z-Wave business, and Silicon Labs will assume all of Sigma’s liabilities related to the Z-Wave business,
for $240 million in cash. We encourage you to carefully read in its entirety the Agreement, which is the principal document governing
the Asset Sale.
 

Completion of the Asset Sale is conditioned on approval of the Asset Sale Proposal.
 
 
THE ASSET SALE 
 

This discussion of the Asset Sale does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement,
which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. You should read
the entire Agreement carefully as it is the primary legal document that governs the Asset Sale.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Preliminary Financial Results
 

Net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $26.5 million. This compares with net revenue of $33.9 million reported in
the previous quarter, and net revenue of $42.7 million in the same period in fiscal 2017. Net revenue derived from the Z-Wave
Business for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $13.9 million, compared to $14.4 million reported in the previous quarter and net
revenue of $11.6 million the same period in fiscal 2017 for the Z-Wave Business.

 
GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was 37.4%. This compares with GAAP gross margin of 50.5% in the

previous quarter, and GAAP gross margin of 50.1% for the same period in fiscal 2017.
 

Non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was 38.0%. This compares with non-GAAP gross margin of 54.7%
in the previous quarter, and non-GAAP gross margin of 50.6% for the same period in fiscal 2017.

 
GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $52.6 million. This compares with GAAP operating expenses

of $36.0 million in the previous quarter, and GAAP operating expenses of $28.6 million for the same period in fiscal 2017. The
increase in operating expenses of $16.6 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was the result of two primary factors.  First,
the Company undertook a substantial reduction in force within its TV Business. As a result, the Company incurred a significant
increase in severance and other related costs, leading to the large sequential increase in restructuring charges.  The severance charges
were approximately $6.7 million.  In addition, the Company recorded impairment charges of $13.7 million in IP, mask set and design
tools.  This impairment was due to the discontinuance of certain product lines and a Last Time Buy plan for the TV Business.

 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $28.0 million. This compares with non-GAAP operating

expenses of $27.8 million in the previous quarter, and non-GAAP operating expenses of $26.0 million for the same period in fiscal
2017.

 
GAAP operating loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was ($42.7) million. This compares with a GAAP operating loss of

($18.9) million in the previous quarter, and GAAP operating loss of $(7.2) million for the same period in fiscal 2017.
 

Non-GAAP operating loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was ($17.9) million. This compares with a non-GAAP operating
loss of ($9.3) million in the previous quarter, and non-GAAP operating loss of $(4.4) million for the same period in fiscal 2017.

 
Fiscal Year 2018 Preliminary Financial Results

 
Net revenue for fiscal 2018 was $139.5 million, compared to net revenue of $220.5 million in fiscal 2017. Net revenue derived

from the Z-Wave Business fiscal 2018 was $53.4 million, compared to $40.1 million from the Z-Wave Business in fiscal 2017.
 

GAAP gross margin in fiscal 2018 was 46.2%, compared to GAAP gross margin of 48.1% in fiscal 2017.
 

Non-GAAP gross margin in fiscal 2018 was 47.6%, compared to non-GAAP gross margin of 49.5% in fiscal 2017.

fiscal 2017.

 
Non-GAAP operating expenses in fiscal 2018 were $108.7 million, compared to non-GAAP operating expenses of $107.4 million

in fiscal 2017.

Non-GAAP operating loss in fiscal 2018 was ($42.2) million. This compares with a non-GAAP operating income of $1.8 million
in fiscal 2017.

 
First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Guidance

 
On March 19, 2018, Sigma also provided guidance for its anticipated financial performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. As a

result of the announcement of the Asset Sale and Sigma’s intention to liquidate and attempt to divest its remaining businesses, Sigma’s
ability to predict its results for the first fiscal quarter is limited. In providing the guidance below, Sigma has made certain assumptions,
which may or may not prove to be accurate. Sigma has made the following material assumptions, among others, in deriving the
guidance below: (i) the Asset Sale is consummated on April 1, 2018, resulting in approximately two months of financial results from
the Z-Wave Business; and (ii) no divestment is made of the TV and Set-top Box Business or the Mobile IoT Business. Based upon

these and other assumptions, and the qualifications and limitations set forth below, Sigma currently anticipates the following
performance in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2019:

 
Net revenue of between $6.5 million and $7.5 million.

 
Non-GAAP gross margin of between 44.0% and 47.0%.

 
Non-GAAP operating expenses of between $17.0 million and $18.0 million.

 
Sigma cannot guarantee that it will achieve the guidance or that its financial results for the first fiscal quarter of 2019 will not

materially vary from the guidance. The guidance has not been updated since it was prepared, and does not take into account any
circumstances or events occurring after the date it was prepared. For the foregoing and other reasons, shareholders and readers of this
proxy statement are cautioned that the guidance should not be regarded as a representation or guarantee that the results will be
achieved and they should not rely on the guidance.

 
The guidance constitutes forward-looking statements and is qualified in its entirety by risks and uncertainties that could result in

the guidance not being achieved, including, but not limited to, demand for our products, our reliance on significant customers, our
ability to timely develop new products, conditions in the markets for our products, factors affecting the semiconductor industry,
general business and economic conditions, the effects of competition and consolidation in the industry, the impact of litigation related
to the Asset Sale or the Liquidation, and other risks and uncertainties contained in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2017, as well as the risks and uncertainties described in the sections of this
proxy statement entitled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

Background of the Asset Sale 
 

Sigma’s Board of Directors, or the Company Board, together with management of Sigma, periodically review and assess Sigma’s
business plan and potential strategic opportunities available to Sigma with the goal of maximizing shareholder value. As part of this
process, the Company Board and management have periodically evaluated whether the continued execution of Sigma’s strategy as a
standalone company, including in combination with divestitures of certain businesses or assets, or the sale of Sigma to, or a
combination of Sigma with, a third party offers the best avenue to maximize shareholder value.
 

In December 2015 and early January 2016, Company A (a strategic party) approached members of Sigma’s management to
discuss a potential acquisition of Sigma by Company A. Sigma’s management indicated that it would discuss this interest with the
Company Board. Sigma and Company A had previously executed a nondisclosure agreement on July 7, 2015. The nondisclosure
agreement contained a “standstill” provision, which prevented Company A from purchasing Sigma securities or announcing publicly a
proposal to acquire Sigma without Sigma’s consent. This standstill provision automatically terminated at such time that Sigma
announced a definitive agreement for the sale or merger of Sigma. The nondisclosure agreement entered into by Sigma with Company
A did not contain a prohibition on Company A making any request that Sigma waive the standstill restrictions (known as a “don’t ask,
don’t waive” provision). Unless otherwise specified below, each of the nondisclosure agreements which Sigma entered into from time
to time as described below contained a similar standstill provision, including an automatic termination feature, and did not contain the
“don’t ask, don’t waive” provision.

On January 5, 2016, Company A delivered a written, non-binding indication of interest to acquire Sigma for $5.79 per share in
cash and a specified number of shares of Company A stock with an estimated value of $1.93 per Sigma share (based on the closing
price of Company A stock on January 5, 2016) for a total estimated purchase price of $7.72 per share. Company A also requested a
45-day exclusivity period during which it proposed to conduct its due diligence and negotiate a definitive agreement. On January 5,
2016, the closing price of Sigma’s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market was $6.43 per share.
 

Between January 5, 2016 and January 21, 2016, Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank held preliminary
conversations with Company A regarding timing of Sigma’s review of Company A’s initial indication of interest. Sigma had
previously worked with Deutsche Bank in connection with prior Sigma transactions and strategic opportunities reviewed by Sigma.
 

On January 21, 2016, Company A delivered an updated non-binding indication of interest to acquire Sigma for $5.79 per share in
cash and a specified number of shares of Company A stock with an estimated value of $2.06 per Sigma share (based on the closing
price of Company A stock on January 19, 2016) for a total estimated purchase price of $7.85 per share. On January 21, 2016, the
closing price of Sigma’s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market was $5.85 per share.
 

On January 21, 2016, the Company Board met with management and a representative of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP,
or Pillsbury, present. The Company Board discussed the indication of interest from Company A and a process to respond to the
indication of interest. The representative from Pillsbury advised the Company Board of its fiduciary duties. At the meeting, the
Company Board met separately with representatives of Deutsche Bank and another investment bank to discuss the potential
engagement of a financial advisor to assist the Company Board in evaluating the indication of interest from Company A and other
potential strategic alternatives, including remaining as a standalone company. After meeting with the investment banks, the Company
Board discussed Sigma’s current operations and directed management to respond to Company A requesting additional time to respond
to its indication of interest to permit Sigma to engage a financial advisor and evaluate the indication of interest in more detail.
 

On February 10, 2016, Sigma engaged Deutsche Bank to serve as its financial advisor in exploring strategic alternatives that may
be available to Sigma. The Company Board selected Deutsche Bank as a result of its consideration of various criteria and factors,
including Deutsche Bank’s experience in the semiconductor industry, its understanding of Sigma’s business and the fact that Deutsche
Bank previously served as financial advisor to Sigma in connection with a previous exploration of strategic alternatives in the prior
five years, that Deutsche Bank had informed Sigma that it was not advising Company A or certain other potential business
combination partners then viewed by the Company Board as the most likely parties to engage with Sigma regarding a potential
strategic transaction, and Deutsche Bank’s overall capabilities and strengths.
 

On February 17, 2016, the Company Board met with management and a representative of Pillsbury to discuss Sigma’s operating
plan for the year ended January 29, 2017, or fiscal 2017, and preliminary estimates of a three-year operating plan. The Company
Board provided feedback to Sigma management, and a revised fiscal 2017 operating plan was subsequently approved at a Company
Board meeting held on February 25, 2016.
 

In February 2016, Sigma management met with representatives of Deutsche Bank to discuss Sigma management’s draft
projections for Sigma’s financial performance for the next three fiscal years and to discuss a potential outline of a process to explore
strategic alternatives. Sigma management, with input from the representatives of Deutsche Bank, developed a list of parties, both
strategic and financial, that were most likely to be interested in a potential transaction with Sigma.
 

On February 26, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury.
Sigma management presented its draft projections for Sigma’s financial performance for the next three fiscal years, and the Company
Board discussed the relative benefits and challenges as a standalone company in attempting to meet the three-year forecasted results.
The Company Board also discussed, with input from representatives of Deutsche Bank, certain preliminary financial information
related to Sigma and considered this information in light of the indication of interest from Company A. The Company Board, with
input from the representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury, discussed a process to explore strategic alternatives, including a
number of parties that may be interested in a potential transaction with Sigma. The Company Board provided direction to Sigma
management to contact additional parties, with assistance from Deutsche Bank, to discuss a potential strategic transaction with Sigma.
 

Following the February 26, 2016 Company Board meeting and throughout March 2016, Sigma management and representatives
of Deutsche Bank contacted several potential parties, consisting of six strategic parties and four financial sponsors (including
Company C), to solicit interest in a potential acquisition of Sigma. As a result of this outreach, Sigma management scheduled three
management meetings and executed four nondisclosure agreements.
 

On February 29, 2016, representatives of Deutsche Bank spoke with Company A’s financial advisor to discuss the Company
Board’s feedback regarding Company A’s indication of interest, including the difficulties for Sigma in entering into exclusive



9/26/2019 ex_101753.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790715/000143774918004982/sigm20180316_defm14a.htm 65/323

discussions with Company A at this time in light of the fact that Sigma had not had an opportunity to properly evaluate other potential
strategic partners, transactions and strategies.
 

On February 29, 2016, Sigma sent preliminary due diligence information to Company B (a financial sponsor), including Sigma’s
then current financial forecasts, which had also been provided to Company A. Sigma had previously executed a nondisclosure
agreement with Company B in June 2015, had previously exchanged preliminary information in mid-2015 and had recently been in
contact with Company B to discuss the possibility of a transaction between the parties.
 

On March 1, 2016, representatives of Deutsche Bank spoke with John Hollister, the Chief Financial Officer of Silicon Labs, to
discuss a potential transaction with Sigma. Mr. Hollister indicated that Silicon Labs would review the opportunity and provide
feedback at a later date.
 

On March 6, 2016, representatives of Deutsche Bank spoke with Company B’s financial advisor to discuss a potential transaction
between Sigma and Company B. The financial advisor for Company B indicated that Company B may be interested in a potential
transaction, but Company B was continuing to evaluate the opportunity.
 

On March 7, 2016, Silicon Labs advised a representative of Deutsche Bank that Silicon Labs was not interested in an acquisition
of Sigma, but would be interested in acquiring the Z-Wave business from Sigma.
 

On March 7, 2016, Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank met with representatives of Company B and its
financial advisor to discuss Sigma’s business and a potential transaction between the parties.
 

On March 15, 2016, Company A’s financial advisor spoke with representatives of Deutsche Bank and advised them that Company
A remained interested in a potential transaction with Sigma and requested additional information about Sigma in order to present a
revised indication of interest.

On March 18, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury. The
Company Board discussed the status of discussions with potential parties, including the recent communications with potential parties
and the near-term expected communications. The Company Board directed Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank
regarding how to proceed in the near-term communications with these parties.
 

On March 21, 2016, Company A delivered an updated non-binding all-cash indication of interest to acquire Sigma for $9.35 per
share. Company A indicated that it would be willing to revise the consideration to include Company A stock if that was preferred by
Sigma. On March 21, 2016, the closing price of Sigma’s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market was $7.82 per share.
 

Also on March 21, 2016, Company B delivered a non-binding all-cash indication of interest to acquire Sigma for $10.25 per
share. Company B indicated that it intended to finance the proposed transaction with a combination of equity and debt financing
provided by third party financial institutions, and that the proposed transaction would not be subject to any financing conditions or
contingencies. Company B indicated it would evaluate which regulatory approvals were required in order to consummate a transaction
during the due diligence phase of discussions. Company B requested that Sigma enter exclusive negotiations with Company B for a
60-day period.
 

On March 22, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the two non-binding proposals that had been received and feedback from other parties that had been contacted. The Company
Board reviewed the two proposals in detail, including certain preliminary financial information relating to each of the proposals, and
discussed next steps in the process for evaluating strategic alternatives, including a discussion of the current pros and cons of
remaining as a standalone company. The Company Board believed that the proposed transaction with Company B would be subject to
various regulatory approvals, including the approval of the United States Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or
CFIUS. The Company Board directed Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank on near-term communications with
Company A and Company B.
 

On March 23, 2016, representatives of Deutsche Bank spoke with Company B’s financial advisor to convey the Company Board’s
feedback regarding Company B’s proposal, indicating that Sigma was engaged in a competitive process and requesting that Company
B submit an improved proposal. Around this same time, representatives of Deutsche Bank spoke with Company A’s financial advisor
to convey the Company Board’s feedback regarding Company A’s proposal, indicating that Sigma was engaged in a competitive
process and requesting that Company A submit an improved proposal.
 

Also on March 23, 2016, Sigma announced its financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and financial guidance for the
first quarter of fiscal 2017. Sigma reported net revenue of $51.5 million for the fourth fiscal quarter, compared to net revenue of $61.6
million in the prior quarter and $54.8 million in the same period from the prior fiscal year. Sigma also announced a GAAP gross
margin of 47.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, compared with a GAAP gross margin of 50.0% in the previous quarter and
48.7% in the same period in the prior year, and a non-GAAP gross margin of 49.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, compared
with a non-GAAP gross margin of 51.7% in the prior quarter and 50.8% in the same period in the prior year. Sigma’s GAAP operating
expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 were $29.7 million, compared with $29.3 million in the prior quarter, and $29.1 million
for the same period in the prior year; and its non-GAAP operating expenses were $27.4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016,
compared with $20.6 million in the prior quarter and $26.1 million for the same period in the prior year. Sigma’s GAAP net loss for
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was $6.2 million, compared with GAAP net income of $6.4 million in the previous quarter, and
GAAP net loss of $3.6 million for the same period in fiscal 2015; and its non-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016
was $0.9 million, compared with non-GAAP net income of $4.7 million in the previous quarter, and non-GAAP net income of $1.5

range of $52.0 million to $56.0 million, non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 46% to 50% and non-GAAP operating expenses of
approximately $28 million. The closing price of Sigma’s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market dropped the day following this
earnings announcement by 19 percent from a closing price of $7.82 per share on March 23, 2016 to $6.31 per share on March 24,
2016.
 

On March 25, 2016, Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank met with representatives of Company B to discuss
more information about Company B, including its potential financing partners and potential regulatory approvals that Company B
would need to obtain for a transaction with Sigma.
 

On March 28, 2016, representatives of Deutsche Bank spoke with Company C (a financial sponsor) regarding Sigma’s strategic
process and timing for submitting a proposal if Company C were interested in moving forward with a transaction. The following day,
Company C indicated it was not interested in moving forward with a transaction to acquire Sigma at this time.
 

On April 7, 2016, Sigma executed a nondisclosure agreement with Silicon Labs consistent with the form of nondisclosure
agreement described above.

On April 11, 2016, at the direction of Sigma’s Board, representatives of Deutsche Bank sent a strategic process letter to Company

B’s financial advisor and to Silicon Labs outlining timing and expectations for a revised proposal.
 

On April 14, 2016, Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank met with Silicon Labs, including Silicon Labs’
Chief Executive Officer, Tyson Tuttle, Mr. Hollister and other members of Silicon Labs’ management team to discuss Sigma’s
business and a potential transaction between Sigma and Silicon Labs. Sigma indicated that it was currently focused on a sale of the
entire company, and not divestitures (including a divestiture of Sigma’s Z-Wave business), and therefore, if Silicon Labs were
interested in a transaction with Sigma, it would need to be structured as an acquisition of the entire company.
 

On April 15, 2016, Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank met with Company A to discuss Sigma’s business
and a potential transaction between Sigma and Company A. Following the meeting and at the direction of the Company Board,
representatives of Deutsche Bank sent a strategic process letter to Company A outlining timing and expectations for a revised
proposal.
 

On April 26, 2016, Company B delivered a revised non-binding all-cash indication of interest to acquire Sigma for $11.25 per
share. Company B indicated that the purchase price would be financed entirely from its existing cash reserves and would not be
subject to any financing conditions or contingencies. Company B indicated it was evaluating whether a CFIUS filing would be
appropriate and provided detailed information regarding other regulatory approvals that would be required in order to complete a
transaction. Company B requested that Sigma enter into exclusive negotiations with Company B for a 30-day period. On April 26,
2016, the closing price of Sigma’s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market was $6.58 per share.

Also, on April 26, 2016, Silicon Labs submitted a non-binding all-cash indication of interest to acquire Sigma at an offer price
between $9.50 and $11.00 per share for the purchase of the entire company. The proposal was not subject to any financing
contingencies, and Silicon Labs indicated that it would fund the purchase price with its own cash and its preexisting credit facility. The
proposal indicated that Silicon Labs’ ability to maximize the purchase price within the stated range of value was directly related to its
ability to quickly gain a high level of comfort that it would be able to identify a buyer for Sigma’s Smart TV business. Silicon Labs
indicated that it anticipated a definitive agreement for the proposed transaction would contain covenants for Sigma to cooperate with
the divestiture of the Smart TV businesses between signing of the definitive agreement and the closing of the proposed transaction.
 

On April 28, 2016, Company A delivered a revised non-binding indication of interest to acquire Sigma for $10.00 per share to be
paid in cash, and a specified number of shares of Company A stock with an estimated value of $1.00 per Sigma share for a total
estimated purchase price of $11.00 per share. The proposal was not subject to any financing contingencies, and Company A indicated
that it intended to fund the cash portion of the purchase price with its own cash and a new Company A credit facility, which it
expected to execute prior to the signing of a definitive agreement with Sigma. Company A indicated that its offer assumed it would be
able to identify a buyer for any businesses of Sigma it did not want to retain. Company A also requested a 30-day exclusivity period
during which it proposed to conduct its due diligence and negotiate a definitive agreement. On April 28, 2016, the closing price of
Sigma’s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market was $6.43 per share.
 

On April 29, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of the strategic process review, including the three non-binding proposals recently received by Sigma. The
Company Board discussed the status of feedback from all other parties that had been contacted by Sigma as part of the strategic
review process, including that no other party was interested in moving forward with a transaction with Sigma at this time. The
Company Board then considered the three proposals it had recently received and the relative strengths and weaknesses of each
proposal, including but not limited to the offer price, closing conditions, financing and other potential requirements that were expected
from the other parties (including potential divestiture of certain businesses). Sigma management provided an update regarding the
current status of the business and expected financial results. The Company Board then discussed Sigma’s prospects as a standalone
company, including the relative benefits of executing on its business plans in the near-term and long-term and weighed these potential
benefits against the risks of execution and competitive pressures. The Company Board then directed Sigma management and
representatives of Deutsche Bank on further communications with the three parties who had submitted proposals and discussed timing
of discussions with these three parties.
 

On April 29, 2016, at the direction of the Company Board, representatives of Deutsche Bank spoke with Silicon Labs’ financial
advisor to provide preliminary feedback on the non-binding proposal from Silicon Labs, including to request a single-price offer,
rather than a range of indicative value. In addition, at the direction of the Company Board, representatives of Deutsche Bank contacted
Company A and Company B to discuss the competitive process and request additional bids.
 

On April 30, 2016, Silicon Labs delivered an updated non-binding proposal declining to provide a single-price offer for the
acquisition of the entire company, which Sigma had previously indicated would not be acceptable in order to move forward in
discussions. Silicon Labs instead provided a non-binding offer of $200 million in cash for Sigma’s Home IoT and Mobile IoT
businesses. Silicon Labs also indicated its willingness to work with other parties who may be interested in purchasing Sigma’s other
business lines in an attempt to structure a purchase of the entire company.
 

On May 11, 2016, Company A notified Sigma that it was suspending its participation in Sigma’s strategic process.
 

On May 13, 2016, at Company Board’s direction, representatives of Deutsche Bank contacted Company D (a financial sponsor) to
discuss a potential transaction with Sigma.
 

On May 17, 2016, Sigma executed a nondisclosure agreement with Company D in substantially the same form as described
above.
 

On May 19, 2016, Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank met with Company D to discuss Sigma’s business
and a potential transaction between Sigma and Company D.
 

Between May 19, 2016 and May 24, 2016, Sigma provided additional due diligence information to Company D.
 

On May 24, 2016, Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank met with Company D to have a follow-up diligence
meeting to discuss Sigma’s business and a potential transaction. Later that same day, at Company Board’s direction, representatives of
Deutsche Bank sent a process letter to Company D outlining expected timing and the information to be provided if Company D
elected to submit a proposal to acquire Sigma.

On June 2, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to discuss
the operations of Sigma and the current status of the Company Board’s review of strategic alternatives. Sigma management presented
updates of each of Sigma’s businesses. The Company Board discussed anticipated next steps in the strategic review process and
Silicon Labs’ request to approach other potential parties who may have an interest in purchasing Sigma’s Smart TV business and who
could partner with Silicon Labs in purchasing the entire company. The Company Board determined to establish a process pursuant to
which Silicon Labs could engage with other third parties, but in a manner that did not jeopardize ongoing conversations with other
potential strategic partners who were willing to purchase the entire company. The Company Board also discussed potential divestiture
structures and alternatives.
 

In June 2016, Sigma continued to provide due diligence materials to interested parties.
 

On June 6, 2016, Sigma announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and financial guidance for the second
quarter of fiscal 2017. Sigma reported net revenue of $53.8 million for the first fiscal quarter, compared to net revenue of $51.5
million in the prior quarter and $55.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Sigma also announced GAAP gross margin of
44.6% and non-GAAP gross margin of 46.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2017; and GAAP operating expenses of $30.0 million and
non-GAAP operating expenses of $27.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Sigma’s GAAP net loss in the first quarter of fiscal
2017 was $8.1 million compared with a GAAP net loss of $6.2 million in the previous quarter, and a GAAP net loss of $0.4 million
for the same period in fiscal 2016; and its non-GAAP net loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $4.2 million, compared with a
non-GAAP net income of $0.9 million in the previous quarter, and non-GAAP net income of $3.2 million for the same period in fiscal
2016. Sigma’s guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 consisted of total revenues to be in the range of $60 million to $63
million, non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 46% to 49% and non-GAAP operating expenses to be under $28 million.
 

On June 21, 2016, Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank met with Company D to have a follow-up diligence
meeting to discuss Sigma’s business and a potential transaction.
 

On June 28, 2016 and in response to Silicon Labs’ request to engage with Company C regarding a potential transaction with
Sigma, Sigma and Company C executed a nondisclosure agreement substantially in the form described above in order to enable
Silicon Labs to discuss with Company C a potential acquisition of Sigma.
 

On July 1, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to discuss
the status of discussions with various parties, including the anticipated receipt of additional indications of interest from at least
Company C and Company D and related timing.
 

In early July 2016, Company E (a strategic party) contacted Sigma to express an interest in exploring a potential acquisition of
Sigma.
 

On July 6, 2016, Company D delivered a non-binding, preliminary all-cash indication of interest to acquire Sigma for between
$8.75 and $9.25 per share. Company D indicated that it would use committed capital and bank facilities for the purpose of financing
the purchase price, and planned to have committed financing in place at the time of execution of a definitive agreement (meaning the
transaction would not be subject to a financing contingency). Company D indicated that the proposed acquisition would be subject to
clearance by CFIUS and, potentially, other regulatory approvals. Company D also requested an exclusivity period of six weeks during
which it proposed to conduct its due diligence and negotiate a definitive agreement. On July 6, 2016, the closing price of Sigma’s
common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market was $6.33 per share.
 

On July 8, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to discuss
the status of discussions with various parties. The Company Board discussed the indication of interest received from Company D and
additional information about Company D’s financing, required regulatory approvals and other factors related to the indication of
interest. The Company Board discussed the current status of discussions with Company C and Silicon Labs, including the likelihood
of receiving a joint proposal from Company C and Silicon Labs, and the preference of Silicon Labs that the initial acquisition of
Sigma be completed by Company C with a subsequent divestiture of the IoT business to Silicon Labs. The representatives of Deutsche
Bank noted that Sigma had previously expressed its preference that the initial acquisition of Sigma be completed by Silicon Labs due
to Silicon Labs’ financial capabilities and fewer regulatory approval requirements, with a subsequent divestiture of Sigma’s non-IoT
businesses to Company C. The Company Board also discussed an unsolicited, inbound inquiry for the acquisition of Sigma by
Company E. The Company Board discussed next steps and provided direction to Sigma management and the representatives of
Deutsche Bank.
 

Also on July 8, 2016, at the direction of Sigma’s Board, representatives of Deutsche Bank sent a strategic process letter to
Company C requesting additional information from Company C and outlining timing and expectations for a proposal.

On July 11, 2016, Company C delivered a non-binding indication of interest, which purported to be a joint proposal from both
Company C and Silicon Labs, but indicated the purchaser of Sigma would be Company C. The proposal set forth an all-cash offer for
Company C to acquire Sigma for between $8.25 and $9.75 per share. Company C indicated that concurrently with, or shortly
following, the closing of the acquisition of Sigma, Company C planned to divest the IoT business and, potentially, certain other assets
(including Sigma’s wired connectivity business) to Silicon Labs. Company C indicated it had access to sufficient funds to consummate
the transaction through a combination of equity capital from its own fund, as well as debt financing to be obtained. As a result,
Company C indicated that the transaction would not be subject to a financing contingency. Company C indicated its belief that the
transaction would be subject to various regulatory reviews and approvals, including CFIUS. Company C indicated its belief that the
proposed acquisition of Sigma by Company C would not be challenged by CFIUS, and accordingly, it did not believe any specific
remedies should be required in a definitive agreement to address the risk that CFIUS approval would not be obtained. On July 11,
2016, the closing price of Sigma’s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market was $7.00 per share.
 

Between July 11, 2016 and July 15, 2016, representatives of Deutsche Bank spoke with Company C’s financial advisor to obtain
more information about Company C’s indication of interest, its financing plans and other related matters. Sigma management and
representatives of Deutsche Bank also spoke with Company B, Company D, Company E and Silicon Labs to discuss a potential
acquisition of Sigma, timing and interests in moving forward with such a transaction.
 

On July 15, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of the strategic process review, including the recently received indications of interest. The Company Board
discussed the indication of interest received from Company C and the participation in such proposal by Silicon Labs, including the
regulatory approvals required for the initial transaction with Company C. The Company Board discussed the status of communications
with Company B, Company D and Company E. At this time, Company B had indicated it continued to search for consortium partners
to join it in its bid to acquire Sigma, Company D was awaiting feedback from Sigma on its most recent indication of interest and
Company E was in the process of obtaining additional diligence information from Sigma to determine whether it would submit an
indication of interest. The Company Board discussed the current status of Sigma’s business and its performance to date in the current
quarter and current outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, which was lower than previously anticipated by Sigma. The Company
Board discussed the relative pros and cons of remaining as a standalone company and the risks to execution of its business plans. The
Company Board then provided direction to Sigma management and the representatives of Deutsche Bank on the strategic review
process, which included (i) to indicate to Company C (and Silicon Labs) and Company D that their current indications of interest were
at a price not compelling enough to engage in exclusive negotiations and to invite each company to continue to conduct due diligence
on Sigma in an effort to position them to increase their respective proposal; (ii) to instruct Company E that in light of its financial
profile, the Company Board did not view an all-cash offer from Company E as reasonably certain at the levels already being expressed
by other parties and did not intend to engage further with Company E; and (iii) to continue to engage with Company B to provide
Company B additional time that it needed to find a financial and/or operating company to partner with it to help fund a transaction
with Sigma.
 

Between July 15, 2016 and July 22, 2016, Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank executed on the direction
provided by the Company Board and spoke with Company B, Company C, Company D and Company E. Throughout July and August
2016, Sigma continued to provide due diligence materials to Company B, Company C and Company D, including holding several
meetings with Sigma management and each of Company B, Company C and Company D to discuss Sigma’s business and a potential
transaction with each of these respective parties.
 

On July 22, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications with Company B, Company C, Company D and Company E. At the direction of the
Company Board, representatives of Deutsche Bank had communicated to Company E that Sigma did not intend to engage further with
Company E, but Company E continued to express an interest in a potential transaction with Sigma. As a result, representatives of
Deutsche Bank had indicated to Company E that the Company Board would review a written proposal from Company E if it desired to
submit such a proposal. The Company Board confirmed that it would review such a proposal if submitted by Company E. The
Company Board provided further direction to Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank on communications with
Company B, Company C and Company D.
 

On July 25, 2016, Company E delivered a non-binding indication of interest to acquire Sigma at a purchase price of $8.10 per
share, consisting of $6.10 per share in cash and $2.00 per share in shares of Company E stock. On July 25, 2016, the closing price of
Sigma’s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market was $6.69 per share.
 

On July 28, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury. Sigma
management provided an update on the current expectations for Sigma’s financial performance for the remainder of the fiscal year if it
remained a standalone company. The Company Board discussed the current status of communications with Company C, Company D
and Company E, including a detailed discussion of Company E’s indication of interest. The Company Board provided direction to

Sigma management and the representatives of Deutsche Bank on a response to Company E and further communications with
Company C and Company D.

On July 29, 2016, at the direction of the Company Board, Thinh Tran, Sigma’s then President and Chief Executive Officer, sent a
letter to Company E requesting additional information from Company E in response to its indication of interest.
 

On August 5, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury. The
Company Board discussed the current status of communications with Company B, Company C, Company D and Company E,
including Sigma management meetings with Company C and Company D. Sigma management reported that Company D continued to
express an interest in a potential transaction with Sigma and it intended to discuss the potential acquisition with its proposed
investment partners and report back to Sigma in the next couple of weeks. Sigma management also reported that Company C had
indicated it would only move forward based on its most recent indication of interest if Sigma entered exclusive discussions with
Company C. The Company Board discussed whether it should grant exclusivity to Company C in light of the ongoing discussions
with other parties, the uncertainty of Company C’s financing, required regulatory approvals and its offer price compared to other
indications of interest it had received. The Company Board provided direction to Sigma management and the representatives of
Deutsche Bank, including rejecting Company C’s demand for exclusivity but inviting it to continue its due diligence review. The
Company Board directed management to continue discussions with Company D and Company E. The Company Board noted that
Company B continued to show interest, but had not demonstrated any progress in partnering with any other parties to acquire Sigma,
which Company B had previously indicated was a condition to moving forward with an acquisition of Sigma. Sigma management then
provided an update on Sigma’s business and current expectations for the current fiscal quarter.
 

On August 12, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury. The
Company Board discussed the current status of communications with Company B, Company C, Company D, Company E and Silicon
Labs, which included the following: (i) Company B was scheduled to meet with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche
Bank the following week to discuss Sigma’s business and a potential strategic transaction, which may include a potential investment
by Company B in Sigma; (ii) Company C had continued to demand exclusivity before proceeding further in its review of a potential
acquisition of Sigma and had also indicated that it was no longer interested in partnering with Silicon Labs in an acquisition of Sigma;
(iii) Company D had indicated its desire to continue to conduct due diligence on Sigma and it would provide an updated indication of
interest to Sigma in the coming weeks; (iv) Company E had provided preliminary information regarding its ability to finance an
acquisition of Sigma and had engaged in further discussions with Sigma management about Sigma’s business; and (v) Silicon Labs no
longer appeared to be actively engaged in the due diligence process with Sigma, particularly in light of Company C’s indication that it
was no longer joining with Silicon Labs in a potential acquisition of Sigma. The Company Board provided direction to Sigma
management and the representatives of Deutsche Bank on further communications with the various parties, including: (i) confirming
to Company C that Sigma would not enter into exclusive discussions with Company C, because, among other reasons, the current
review by Company C remained at a very early stage, Company C’s preliminary indication of interest was not at a compelling price,
the status of discussions with other potential partners and the current belief in Sigma’s standalone strategy and prospects compared to
the price being offered by Company C; (ii) confirming to Company E that the Company Board did not believe Company E’s financing
plan was viable in light of its current financial profile, and therefore, Sigma would not continue to engage with Company E at this
time, but would re-engage in the future if Company E’s financial profile improved; (iii) contacting Silicon Labs to confirm whether it
was interested in continuing discussions with Sigma; and (iv) continuing to engage with Company B and Company D to explore a
potential transaction with either party. The independent directors then met outside the presence of Sigma management with the
representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to discuss a continued process to engage with Company B and Company D with
additional involvement from independent directors in light of potential interest of Sigma management in continued employment
following an acquisition by either Company B or Company D, who were both financial sponsors. Members of Sigma management had
been previously advised by a representative of Pillsbury at the direction of the Sigma independent directors to decline to engage in
discussions regarding continued employment and to refer parties to an independent director to discuss this topic. The independent
directors requested that Mike Dodson, the Lead Director of Sigma’s Board, take an active role in discussions with Company B and
Company D and provide continued input to Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank on the strategic process.
 

On August 18, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury. The
Company Board reviewed with representatives of Deutsche Bank certain preliminary financial information prepared based on the then
current financial projections prepared by Sigma management, which were subject to change. The Company Board also discussed the
current status of communications with various interested parties.

On September 5, 2016, Company B delivered a non-binding all-cash indication of interest for the acquisition of Sigma at a
purchase price of $11.00 per share. In its indication of interest, Company B identified two consortium partners that would participate
in the transaction, but indicated that additional consortium partners would be identified at a future date. Company B noted that the
purchase price would be financed entirely from Company B’s and the other consortium partners’ existing cash reserves and would not
be subject to a financing contingency. Company B indicated that certain regulatory approvals would be required, including regulatory
approvals from its home country as well as potential U.S. regulatory approvals, including CFIUS approval. Company B requested an
exclusivity period of 60 days.
 

Between September 5, 2016 and September 9, 2016, representatives of Deutsche Bank, at the request of the Company Board,
spoke with Company B’s financial advisor about Company B’s indication of interest, including attempting to learn more information
about Company B’s proposed consortium, the identity of potential consortium members who were not yet named in the indication of
interest and timing for identifying these consortium members.
 

On September 6, 2016, Sigma announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and financial guidance for the
third quarter of fiscal 2017. Sigma reported net revenue of $61.3 million for the second fiscal quarter, compared to net revenue of
$53.8 million in the prior quarter and $58.3 million in the same period from the prior fiscal year. Sigma also announced GAAP gross
margin of 48.2% and non-GAAP gross margin of 49.9% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017; and GAAP operating expenses of $29.9
million and non-GAAP operating expenses of $27.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Sigma’s GAAP net loss in the
second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.7 million, compared with a GAAP net loss of $8.1 million in the previous quarter, and GAAP net
income of $0.3 million for the same period in fiscal 2016; and its non-GAAP net income in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was $2.6
million, compared with a non-GAAP net loss of $4.2 million in the previous quarter, and non-GAAP net income of $4.5 million for
the same period in fiscal 2016. Sigma’s guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 consisted of total revenues to be in the range of
$62 million to $65 million, non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 47% to 50% and non-GAAP operating expenses to be under
$28 million.
 

On September 9, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss Company B’s indication of interest and the status of discussions with other parties. The Company Board discussion included a
detailed discussion of the proposed terms, including offer price, the requested exclusivity period and the impact exclusivity could have
on the Company Board’s process to evaluate other alternatives, the status of diligence performed to date by Company B, its advisors
and the current status of the identity of the parties to participate in Company B’s proposed consortium of partners. The Company
Board discussed the need to obtain more information about the potential participants in the consortium and to analyze any regulatory
risk associated with these participants. The Company Board directed Sigma management and the representatives of Deutsche Bank to
seek to negotiate a shorter exclusivity period and to obtain additional information prior to the Company Board making a final
determination as to whether to enter into exclusivity with Company B. The Company Board then discussed the current status of
communications with Company D and Silicon Labs, and discussed a process to confirm the interest of any other parties who had
previously expressed an interest in an acquisition of Sigma before entering into exclusivity with any party.
 

Between September 9, 2016 and September 16, 2016, at the direction of the Company Board, representatives of Deutsche Bank
contacted various parties who had previously expressed an interest in a transaction with Sigma to discuss a potential acquisition of
Sigma and indicated to these parties that Sigma may be selecting a party with which to enter into exclusive negotiations with the intent
of entering into a definitive agreement to be acquired.
 

On September 16, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications from various interested parties. The Company Board noted that Silicon Labs had
continued to express interest in only moving forward with a transaction to purchase certain Sigma businesses and not the entire
company. Sigma management reported on recent communications with Company D, its status with diligence and review of a potential
transaction with Sigma. At this time, Company D was beginning to demonstrate some reservations with moving forward at a price that
was higher than its most recent indication of interest. The Company Board discussed Company B’s indication of interest and the
limited additional information about its potential consortium partners that Sigma was able to obtain from Company B. The Company
Board discussed the most recent communication from Company C and its continued demand for exclusivity. Based on the current
status of discussions with other parties, the limited amount of due diligence that Company C had performed to date, the potential
regulatory challenges and other factors related to an acquisition by Company C, the Company Board determined to reject Company
C’s exclusivity demand. The Company Board discussed next steps in the strategic review process, which consisted primarily of further
investigation and diligence on Company B’s consortium and to continue to discuss a potential transaction with Company D.

On September 23, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications with various interested parties. The Company Board discussed the status of Sigma’s
review of Company B’s consortium of partners, including the fact that Company B continued to finalize the consortium and could not
provide complete information about the consortium. As a result, Company B indicated a willingness to proceed in discussions without
exclusivity, while it continued to finalize its consortium of potential partners that would participate in an acquisition of Sigma. The
Company Board discussed recent communications with Company D, including Company D’s feedback that it continued to remain
interested in an acquisition of Sigma, but at a lower price than previously indicated, which would also be lower than Company B’s
current indicative price. As a result, the Company Board determined not to grant Company D exclusivity as well.
 

Between September 23, 2016 and October 21, 2016, Sigma management, with involvement from Mr. Dodson, and the
representatives of Deutsche Bank continued to engage with Company B and Company D on a potential acquisition of Sigma,
providing more diligence information about Sigma and attempting to obtain more information about Company B’s potential
consortium partners.
 

On October 21, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications with various interested parties. The Company Board noted that Company B had not
progressed in identifying any further consortium partners and that there was no indication from Company B that it would be able to do
so in the near future. The Company Board noted that a meeting with Sigma management and Company B was scheduled for the
following week, but if Company B had not made more progress with its consortium members soon, Company B’s access to Sigma
diligence materials would be terminated subject to Company B making more progress with its consortium members.
 

On October 28, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of Company B’s potential consortium and the fact that no additional progress had been made since the last
Company Board meeting. The Company Board determined to provide Company B additional time and directed representatives of
Deutsche Bank to schedule a meeting for late November with Company B to review the status of Company B’s proposed consortium,
to provide an update on Sigma’s operations and recent performance and to discuss a potential acquisition of Sigma.
 

On November 4, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications with Company B and Sigma’s attempt to schedule a meeting with Company B for late
November. The Company Board also discussed the current status of CFIUS, including the current status of a recent CFIUS review of a
proposed transaction in the semiconductor industry involving a China-based purchaser.
 

On November 16, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and a representative of Pillsbury to discuss Sigma
management’s preliminary report on Sigma’s financial results for the third fiscal quarter and its preliminary outlook for the fourth
fiscal quarter. In light of the results and current outlook, the Company Board discussed potential measures to improve profitability,
including potential actions to drive increased sales and to reduce operating expenses.
 

On December 2, 2016, the Company Board met with Sigma management and a representative of Pillsbury to discuss Sigma’s
financial results for the third fiscal quarter and its forecast for the fourth fiscal quarter. The Company Board received a report from
Sigma management on all of Sigma’s businesses. The Company Board discussed actions that could be taken to lower product costs
and operating expenses and directed management to prepare a plan to implement cost and expense reduction measures.
 

On December 6, 2016, Sigma announced its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and financial guidance for the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Sigma reported net revenue of $62.7 million for the third fiscal quarter, compared to net revenue of $61.3
million in the prior quarter and $61.6 million in the same period from the prior fiscal year. Sigma also announced GAAP gross margin
of 49.4% and non-GAAP gross margin of 51.0% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017; and GAAP operating expenses of $28.8 million
and non-GAAP operating expenses of $26.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Sigma’s GAAP net income in the third
quarter of fiscal 2017 was $0.2 million, compared with GAAP net loss of $1.7 million in the previous quarter, and GAAP net income
of $6.4 million for the same period in fiscal 2016; and its non-GAAP net income in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was $3.3 million,
compared with non-GAAP net income of $2.5 million in the previous quarter, and non-GAAP net income of $4.7 million for the same
period in fiscal 2016. Sigma’s guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 consisted of total revenues to be in the range of $42
million to $45 million, non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 47% to 50%, and non-GAAP operating expenses to be under $28
million. The closing price of Sigma’s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market dropped the day following this earnings
announcement by 28 percent from a closing price of $7.75 per share on December 6, 2016 to $5.60 per share on December 7, 2016.
 

Throughout December 2016 and January 2017, Sigma management met, on occasion, with parties who were potentially interested
in a transaction with Sigma, including follow-up meetings with Company B and Company D. In late January 2017, Company D
requested that its representatives meet directly with the Company Board to discuss its interest in an acquisition of Sigma.

On January 17, 2017, Sigma executed a nondisclosure agreement with Company F (a strategic party) who had expressed interest
in purchasing Sigma’s Smart TV and set-top box businesses. This nondisclosure agreement did not contain a standstill provision.
 

On February 3, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and a representative of Pillsbury to discuss Sigma’s
proposed fiscal 2018 operating plan. During the meeting, the Company Board met with a representative of Company D to discuss
Company D and a potential acquisition of Sigma by Company D, including timing, Company D’s strategic interest in Sigma and its
businesses and potential regulatory approvals necessary to complete the acquisition. Following the discussions with the representative
of Company D, the Company Board discussed potential divestitures of all of its businesses in separate transactions and a process to
explore in more detail potential divestitures. The Company Board believed, at this time, that the potential buyers for the entire
company either lacked interest or carried to much financing or regulatory risk. As a result, the Company Board determined to evaluate
in more detail potential divestitures as an alternative to a sale of the entire company as a potential path to maximize shareholder value.
 

On February 7, 2017, Sigma executed a nondisclosure agreement with Company E. Company E had previously expressed an
interest in purchasing the entire company, but was now interested in reviewing a potential transaction to purchase Sigma’s wired
connectivity business.
 

On February 12, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss Sigma’s market positioning to potential strategic partners and financial performance forecasts based on management’s current
view of Sigma’s potential performance and the risks associated with trying to achieve these forecasted results. The Company Board
requested that management prepare updated three-year forecasts based on the discussion and feedback provided at this meeting and
present such updated forecasts to the Company Board at a future meeting. The Company Board also discussed the possibility of
divesting each of the businesses operated by Sigma.
 

During the month of February 2017, Sigma management with assistance from representatives of Deutsche Bank, and at the
direction of the Company Board, met with various parties to discuss potential strategic alternatives, including the divestiture of certain
Sigma businesses.
 

On February 17, 2017, Company F (a strategic party) delivered a preliminary, non-binding proposal to acquire the assets
comprising Sigma’s multimedia business, which consisted of Sigma’s Smart TV and set-top box businesses. Company F’s acquisition
would be subject to regulatory approvals including CFIUS approval.
 

On February 24, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss Sigma’s strategic three-year plan and financial forecast. The Company Board authorized Sigma management to use the
financial forecasts discussed at this meeting with potentially interested buyers. The Company Board also discussed the status of
communications with various parties who had expressed preliminary interest in a potential strategic transaction with Sigma, including
Company F’s proposal to acquire assets comprising Sigma’s multimedia business. The Company Board directed Sigma management
and representatives of Deutsche Bank to continue to engage with Company F on the potential divestiture of Sigma’s multimedia
business, including seeking clarification on certain terms referenced in Company F’s proposal. In light of the preliminary interest
Sigma had received in regards to the potential purchase of particular business lines, the Company Board believed it was possible that
more value could potentially be created for Sigma shareholders if certain business lines were sold prior to selling Sigma itself.
Furthermore, the Company Board believed that it would be in a better position to evaluate all potential opportunities if it understood
the value Sigma could gain by selling certain business lines.

purchasing certain of Sigma’s business lines. Company D had also indicated that it was not interesting in pursuing an acquisition of
Sigma at this time. After discussing the various strategic alternatives, timing, and priorities of such alternatives, and given the current
lack of interest from third parties to acquire the entire company, the Company Board determined to focus its near-term efforts on

due diligence review of Sigma on a non-exclusive basis, with the expectation that Company G would consider increasing its offer

diligence review was completed. The Company Board also directed representatives of Deutsche Bank to request additional

following completion of the due diligence process. The Company Board also discussed the fact that Silicon Labs’ interest at this time

On July 14, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications with Company D, Company G, Company H and other parties who had expressed
preliminary interest in acquiring Sigma. The Company Board discussed a proposal to announce publicly that the Company Board was
evaluating strategic alternatives and that it had engaged Deutsche Bank to assist in this evaluation. In considering a potential public
announcement, the Company Board took into account a variety of factors, including but not limited to the potential impact on current
discussions with parties involved in the process, the potential impact on Sigma’s business and its relationship with customers,
suppliers and other partners, the potential impact on employees, and the anticipated benefits to the strategic process to ensure any
potentially interested party would be aware that Sigma was evaluating strategic alternatives and may be willing to sell the entire
company or certain businesses. The Company Board determined to move forward with a public announcement that it had engaged
Deutsche Bank to assist the Company Board in evaluating strategic alternatives. The Company Board also discussed the current status
of communications with parties interested in purchasing one of Sigma’s businesses, and not the entire company.
 

On July 19, 2017, representatives of Deutsche Bank spoke with Company D to discuss the current status of Company D’s

On July 24, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications with Company D, Company G, Company H and other parties who had expressed
preliminary interest in acquiring Sigma. The Company Board noted that Sigma had sent process letters to Company D, Company G
and Company H indicating that revised bids should be submitted no later than August 7, 2017, which would include a response to an
initial draft agreement and plan of merger that had been delivered to each of the potential bidders. The Company Board also discussed
the proposed public announcement related to the Company Board’s review of strategic alternatives and communications with major
shareholders.
 

On July 26, 2017, Sigma issued a press release announcing that it had engaged Deutsche Bank as its financial advisor to assist in
its exploration of strategic alternatives that may enhance shareholder value. Sigma announced that this review may result in Sigma
continuing to implement value-enhancing initiatives as a standalone company, such as the continued implementation of its previously
announced restructuring plans, a sale of the company or certain product lines, or other possible transactions. Subsequent to this public
announcement, Sigma and Deutsche Bank received several inbound inquiries regarding a potential transaction with Sigma, both for an
acquisition of Sigma and for the purchase of certain businesses of Sigma. These communications included an expression of interest
from Silicon Labs to engage with Sigma regarding the purchase of Sigma’s Z-Wave business.
 

On July 28, 2017, Company D contacted representatives of Deutsche Bank to schedule additional meetings with Sigma
management related to Sigma’s Z-Wave and mobile IoT businesses, which meetings occurred in early August 2017.

discuss the current status of communications with interested parties, including a review of the initial inbound inquiries received
following the public announcement that Sigma had engaged Deutsche Bank as its financial advisor. The Company Board discussed the
recent communications from Silicon Labs on its request to discuss the potential purchase of Sigma’s Z-Wave business. The Company
Board discussed in detail the current status of discussions with Company D, Company G and Company H. At this time, Company D
was continuing to conduct due diligence and continued to indicate a desire to purchase the entire company, Company G was also
continuing to conduct due diligence but had so far failed to provide meaningful information about the proposed consortium of
investors necessary to fund the purchase price and Company H had recently indicated it was not likely to move forward in submitting
an updated indication of interest. The Company Board provided direction to Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank
on further communications with various parties, including continuing to try to encourage Company D, Company G and Company H to
submit revised proposals with increased offer prices and to direct Silicon Labs that it should bid on an acquisition of the entire
company, rather than for only the Z-Wave business.

On July 31, 2017, Silicon Labs submitted a preliminary, non-binding proposal to acquire all assets related to Sigma’s efforts in
IoT, including the Z-Wave IoT and mobile IoT businesses for an all-cash purchase price of $150 million. Silicon Labs indicated it
would fund the purchase price with cash on its balance sheet and the transaction would not be subject to a financing contingency.
Silicon Labs’ proposal specifically excluded the assumption of any liabilities, and, to the extent any liabilities of these businesses were
to be assumed, the amount of such liabilities would be deducted from the purchase price.
 

On August 3, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications with Silicon Labs, Company D, Company H and Company G, as well as other parties
that had expressed preliminary interest in a potential transaction with Sigma. The Company Board discussed the potential to divest
Sigma’s IoT businesses to Silicon Labs, and directed Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank to communicate to
Silicon Labs that Sigma would consider a potential divestiture of its IoT businesses to Silicon Labs, but it was a requirement that
Silicon Labs increase its offer price for Sigma to invest further time and resources in such a transaction and to provide access to
Silicon Labs to diligence materials related to these businesses. Sigma management provided an update on the preliminary financial
results for Sigma in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and the current outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. In general, the
preliminary financial results and current outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year were lower than what Sigma had originally
expected. The Company Board determined that this updated financial information should be provided to Company D, Company G and
Company H before any revised indications of interest were submitted by these parties. The Company Board discussed the status of
communications with other parties who had expressed preliminary interest in a potential transaction with Sigma.
 

On August 4, 2017, Silicon Labs submitted a revised preliminary, non-binding proposal to acquire all assets related to Sigma’s
efforts in IoT, including the Z-Wave IoT and mobile IoT businesses for an all-cash purchase price of $175 million. Silicon Labs
indicated it would fund the purchase price with cash on its balance sheet and the transaction would not be subject to a financing
contingency. Silicon Labs’ proposal specifically excluded the assumption of any liabilities, and, to the extent any liabilities of these
businesses were to be assumed, the amount of such liabilities would be deducted from the purchase price.
 

In early August 2017, Sigma continued to receive inbound inquiries from parties expressing an interest in a potential transaction
with Sigma, including both the purchase of the entire company and the acquisition of certain businesses. Sigma provided diligence
materials to and, in some instances, met with some of these parties to provide additional information and to discuss a potential
transaction.
 

On August 8, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications with various parties, including Company D, Company G, Company H and Silicon Labs.
Sigma management discussed proposed changes to Sigma’s three-year financial forecast in light of recent performance, currently
available information about Sigma’s business, market trends and other developments. The Company Board authorized Sigma
management to share the updated forecast with potentially interested parties participating in the strategic process. The Company Board
also discussed a more significant operating expense reduction plan than what was currently being implemented by Sigma and directed
Sigma management to review additional expense reduction measures.
 

On August 9, 2017, Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank met with Company D to discuss the revised Sigma
forecast and other updates about Sigma’s business. At or around August 9, 2017, Sigma management also provided the updated
forecast to Company G and Company H.
 

On August 11, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications with Company D, Company G, Company H, Silicon Labs and other potentially interested
parties. During the meeting, the Company Board noted the following: (i) Company G had indicated that it intended to submit an
updated bid on August 15, 2017, which bid would include an updated offer price, more clarity on its financing plans and consortium
(though without commitment letters) and a description of the items remaining open at that time; (ii) Company D had indicated that it
intended to submit an updated bid on August 15, 2017, had progressed significantly in its diligence review and that its updated bid
would include detailed feedback on the draft definitive agreement submitted by Sigma to bidders; and (iii) Silicon Labs was beginning
to engage with respect to a potential transaction to acquire all of Sigma (not just the IoT businesses) and had scheduled management
diligence meetings for the following week, but its stated interest continued to be at this time limited to Sigma’s IoT business. At this
time, the Company Board believed that Company H would not move forward with an updated offer. The Company Board also
discussed communications with other parties who were not progressing as quickly as possible or who had recently indicated that they
were no longer interested in pursuing a potential transaction with Sigma.
 

On August 14, 2017, Mr. Tran met with representatives of Company G to discuss a potential transaction with Sigma.

On August 15, 2017, Company H informed a representative of Deutsche Bank that it did not intend to move forward in a potential
transaction with Sigma.
 

On August 15, 2017, Company G’s financial advisor indicated to representatives of Deutsche Bank that Company G had
authorized them to re-iterate Company G’s original non-binding offer to acquire Sigma in an all-cash transaction at $7.50 per share.
Company G’s financial advisor did not convey any additional information or clarity regarding Company G’s financing capabilities and
investment consortium, and indicated that Company G continued to try to solidify its financing plans. On August 15, 2017, the closing
price of Sigma’s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market was $6.35 per share.
 

On August 16, 2017, Company D submitted a revised non-binding all-cash indication of interest to acquire Sigma for a purchase
price of $7.00 per share. Company D indicated that it would use committed equity capital for the purpose of financing the transaction,
planned to have equity commitment letters in place at the time of executing a definitive agreement with Sigma and, accordingly, the
proposed transaction would not be subject to a financing contingency. Company D’s offer would be subject to regulatory approvals,
including CFIUS approval. Company D requested exclusivity until September 6, 2017, which was the day before Sigma planned to
announce its earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Company D provided an issues list in response to the draft definitive
agreement and plan of merger that Sigma had provided bidders. Notably, Company D’s offer did not provide for a reverse termination
fee which would be paid by Company D to Sigma in the event that CFIUS failed to approve the transaction. On August 16, 2017, the
closing price of Sigma’s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market was $6.30 per share.
 

On August 17, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the indication of interest received from Company D, the confirmation of the prior offer from Company G and the status of
communications with other interested parties, including Silicon Labs. The Company Board, with input from the representatives of
Deutsche Bank, reviewed certain preliminary financial information relating to the indications of interest. The Company Board also
considered and discussed a variety of issues related to the indications of interest, including regulatory approvals and related timing, the
available information on potential financing for these parties and other relevant factors. The Company Board discussed that Silicon
Labs’ interest continued to be limited to a purchase of Sigma’s IoT businesses, and not the entire company, and compared a divestiture
of its IoT assets to Silicon Labs with the current indications of interest from Company D and Company G for the acquisition of the
entire company. The Company Board also considered its standalone prospects and the value that could be created for shareholders
should Sigma remain as a standalone company and the risks associated with this alternative. The Company Board provided direction
to Sigma management and the representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury, which included attempting to negotiate an increase in
price with Company D and an improvement in the terms highlighted in Company D’s issues list to the draft agreement and plan of
merger, attempting to convince Silicon Labs to acquire the entire company rather than just Sigma’s IoT assets, and attempting to
obtain more information from Company G regarding its financing plans and ability to increase its purchase price.
 

In late August 2017, Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury attempted to negotiate an increase in
purchase price and better material offer terms with Company D, including a reverse termination fee to be paid by Company D to
Sigma in the event CFIUS did not approve the proposed transaction. Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank also
continued to seek to impress upon Silicon Labs that in order to be competitive, it needed to consider an acquisition of the entire
company. Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank also continued to seek additional information from Company G
regarding its financing plans and ability to increase its offer price.
 

On August 21, 2017, representatives from Pillsbury, at the request of the Company Board, met with Company G’s legal counsel to
discuss the draft agreement and plan of merger that Sigma had provided to interested bidders and to receive preliminary feedback from
Company G regarding the draft agreement.
 

On August 22, 2017, Company D submitted a revised non-binding all-cash indication of interest to acquire Sigma for a purchase
price of $7.35 per share. Company D indicated that it would use committed equity capital for the purpose of financing the transaction,
planned to have equity commitment letters in place at the time of executing a definitive agreement with Sigma and, accordingly, the
proposed transaction would not be subject to a financing contingency. Company D’s offer would be subject to regulatory approvals,
including CFIUS approval. Company D requested exclusivity until September 6, 2017. Company D provided an updated issues list
regarding the draft definitive agreement and plan of merger, making certain changes in response to requests made by Sigma, but
continuing to reject Sigma’s request for a reverse termination fee in the event CFIUS failed to approve the proposed transaction. On
August 22, 2017, the closing price of Sigma’s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market was $6.20 per share.
 

Also on August 22, 2017, representatives of Pillsbury, at the request of the Company Board, met with Company D’s legal counsel
to discuss the issues list relating to the draft agreement and plan of merger that Company D had submitted with its indication of
interest.

On August 24, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications with Company D, Company G and Silicon Labs. At this time, all other parties with
whom Sigma had previously had discussions regarding a potential acquisition of Sigma had indicated that they were not interested in a
potential transaction with Sigma. The representative of Pillsbury discussed CFIUS, its review process, the expected timeline for
CFIUS to review a transaction and the current status of CFIUS, as an organization, as well as the results of recent transaction reviews
undertaken by CFIUS. The Company Board held a detailed discussion of the current status of CFIUS, its likely review of a proposed
transaction with Company D or Company G and related timing and risks for such a review. The Company Board then reviewed certain
preliminary financial information regarding the divestiture of Sigma’s IoT assets. The Company Board provided direction to Sigma
management and the representatives of Deutsche Bank.
 

On August 24, 2017, representatives of Deutsche Bank, at the request of the Company Board, met with Company D to discuss key
terms of Company D’s current offer and process timeline. Company D expressed a strong desire to finalize discussions and enter into
exclusivity in light of the amount of time they had engaged with Sigma and the current status of discussions.
 

On August 25, 2017, Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank met with Silicon Labs and its financial advisor,
Morgan Stanley, to discuss information related to Sigma’s businesses other than the IoT businesses and to discuss a potential
acquisition of Sigma by Silicon Labs.
 

On August 27, 2017, a representative of Silicon Labs communicated to Sigma that Silicon Labs was evaluating and working
toward making an offer to acquire Sigma (and not just an offer to acquire Sigma’s IoT assets).
 

On August 27, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications with Company D, Company G and Silicon Labs. The Company Board discussed the
upcoming scheduled meeting between Company D and the Company Board, Sigma management and each companies’ respective
advisors. The Company Board discussed the likelihood that Silicon Labs would make an offer to acquire the entire company and
recent communications received from Silicon Labs indicating such an offer was forthcoming. The Company Board discussed
Company G, noting that no progress had been made in Company G’s efforts to form an investment consortium or provide additional
clarity on its financing plans, and as a result, the Company Board determined to focus Sigma’s time and efforts on attempting to reach
preliminary agreement with Company D or Silicon Labs on an acquisition of the entire company.
 

In the morning of August 28, 2017, the Company Board, Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury
met with Company D and its legal counsel to discuss a potential transaction with Company D to acquire Sigma, the material terms of
such a transaction, including price, and related matters such as timing and regulatory approvals. At the conclusion of this meeting,
Company D verbally agreed to increase its all-cash offer price to acquire Sigma to $7.50 per share. Company D also made certain
other concessions on the material terms of the acquisition; however, it continued to reject Sigma’s request for Company D to pay a
reverse termination fee in the event CFIUS did not approve the proposed transaction. Company D indicated that its offer would be
open only until 8:00 a.m. (Pacific) on August 29, 2017 and that if Sigma was interested in moving forward with Company D, it would
require exclusivity until September 16, 2017.
 

In the afternoon of August 28, 2017, Silicon Labs delivered a non-binding, preliminary all-cash indication of interest to acquire
Sigma for an aggregate price of $283 million, which Silicon Labs indicated equated to approximately $7.10 per share. Silicon Labs
requested a 45-day exclusivity period. Its offer was not subject to a financing contingency.
 

At the request of the Company Board, representatives of Deutsche Bank provided initial feedback to Morgan Stanley regarding
the preliminary indication of interest from Silicon Labs, including a request for Silicon Labs to increase its purchase price and to make
certain changes to the information contained in the indication of interest and the terms of exclusivity.
 

At the request of the Company Board, representatives of Deutsche Bank provided additional feedback to Company D about its
current offer terms and requested that Company D increase its offer price and consider certain changes to the material terms of its
offer, including by offering a reverse termination fee.
 

On August 28, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications with Company D and Silicon Labs. The Company Board compared the proposals from
Company D and Silicon Labs and discussed the pros and cons of each offer, including the offer price and the fact that Company D’s
offer price was greater than the offer price from Silicon Labs, deal certainty and the fact that a transaction with Silicon Labs would
involve significantly less regulatory approvals (if any) and significantly fewer risk related to financing compared to a transaction with
Company D, and other considerations, such as the timing of consummating a deal with Silicon Labs compared to Company D. The
Company Board understood that Silicon Labs intended to submit a revised indication of interest on August 29, 2017; and therefore,

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790715/000143774918004982/sigm20180316_defm14a.htm 91/323

determined to wait until the next morning before determining whether to proceed in exclusivity with Company D based on its latest
offer or to proceed with Silicon Labs.

Early in the morning on August 29, 2017, the Company Board met again with Sigma management and representatives of
Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to discuss the current status of communications with Silicon Labs and Company D. The Company Board
discussed a recent e-mail communication from Silicon Labs indicating the seriousness of its offer and intent to proceed with an
acquisition of Sigma, but noting that it needed additional time to discuss the offer price with its board of directors before making a
determination whether it could increase its offer price. The Company Board held a further discussion on whether to wait to see if
Silicon Labs would increase its offer price or to proceed to enter into exclusivity with Company D in light of Company D’s stated
deadline for the termination of its offer. The representative from Pillsbury discussed the current regulatory environment with CFIUS.
The Company Board determined to contact Company D to inform it that Sigma needed additional time to consider an alternative offer
from another company and that the Company Board felt it could not proceed with Company D under the circumstances in light of the
Company Board’s fiduciary duty to maximize value for its shareholders. The Company Board directed the representatives of Deutsche
Bank to contact Morgan Stanley to discuss the status of Silicon Labs’ consideration of an increased offer price. The Company Board
determined to reconvene shortly following the proposed communication with Company D and with Morgan Stanley.
 

Following the Company Board meeting, Pete Thompson, an independent member of the Company Board at the time, contacted a
representative of Company D to explain that the Company Board felt it was necessary to wait and see if another company would
increase its offer price before the Company Board could agree to enter exclusivity with Company D. Mr. Thompson indicated that the
Company Board understood if Company D was going to revoke its preliminary proposal, but requested that Company D continue to
engage with Sigma should the other company not increase its offer price. The representative from Company D indicated that Company
D would not increase its offer price, but may improve other material terms related to its proposal and requested that the Company
Board contact Company D with a final determination as soon as possible.
 

Following the Company Board meeting, a representative of Deutsche Bank contacted a representative of Morgan Stanley to
discuss the status of Silicon Labs’ offer to acquire Sigma. The representative of Morgan Stanley indicated that Silicon Labs was
continuing to review its offer and would be back in contact with Sigma by the end of the day.
 

The Company Board reconvened its meeting with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury shortly
following the communications with Company D and Morgan Stanley. The Company Board determined to meet later in the day to
discuss any additional feedback from Silicon Labs.
 

Later in the day on August 29, 2017, Tyson Tuttle, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Silicon Labs, contacted Martin
Manniche, an independent member of the Company Board, to confirm Silicon Labs’ intent to deliver a revised offer to Sigma. Mr.
Tuttle did not indicate what the revised offer would say at this time.
 

Late on August 29, 2017, Silicon Labs delivered a revised, non-binding preliminary indication of interest to acquire Sigma for an
aggregate price of $293 million in cash, which Silicon Labs indicated equated to approximately $7.35 per share. Silicon Labs made
certain changes to its requested exclusivity period, including reducing it from 45 days to 30 days, with an automatic extension of an
additional 15 days provided Silicon Labs was working in good faith toward the consummation of the proposed acquisition.
 

Late on August 29, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury
to discuss the indications of interest from Silicon Labs and Company D and to make a determination regarding which party to select to
enter into exclusivity. The Company Board discussed the current offer terms from both parties and the most recent communications
with each of the parties. The representative from Pillsbury advised the Company Board on its fiduciary duties in making a decision to
enter into exclusivity with a single party and in evaluating the two acquisition bids. After discussion, the Company Board
unanimously approved entering into an exclusivity period with Silicon Labs based on its most recent proposal. The Company Board
requested that Sigma management, with assistance from representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury, negotiate the final form of
exclusivity agreement and indication of interest with Silicon Labs the following day, and authorized Sigma management to execute the
exclusivity agreement with Silicon Labs based on the changes discussed.
 

At the request of the Company Board and immediately following the Company Board meeting, a representative from Deutsche
Bank contacted Company D to inform it that Sigma intended to enter into exclusivity with another party and that Sigma would no
longer be communicating with Company D.

In the morning of August 30, 2017, at the request of the Company Board, a representative of Deutsche Bank contacted a
representative of Company G’s financial advisor to inform it that Sigma intended to enter into exclusivity with another party and that
Sigma would no longer be communicating with Company G. Company G’s financial advisor indicated that that it had no update on
Company G’s efforts to solidify its financing needs and consortium members notwithstanding their understanding of the urgency of
the timing. Sigma did not hear from Company G after August 30, 2017.
 

In the morning of August 30, 2017, Company D delivered an updated non-binding proposal to acquire Sigma for a price of $8.00
per share in cash and added a reverse termination fee if CFIUS did not approve the proposed transaction (though it agreed only to half
the size of the fee that Sigma had previously proposed).
 

In the morning of August 30, 2017, Silicon Labs delivered a revised, non-binding indication of interest to acquire Sigma for a
purchase price of $7.35 per share in an all-cash transaction and agreeing to make certain changes to the exclusivity agreement.
 

On August 30, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current offers from Company D and Silicon Labs, as well as the feedback received from Company G’s financial advisor.
The Company Board re-evaluated and considered the current offers from Company D and Silicon Labs, including weighing various
considerations of offer price, deal certainty, potential regulatory hurdles and other considerations. While the offer price from Company
D was higher than that from Silicon Labs, the Company Board discussed the significant risks associated with Company D’s offer and
the uncertainty of completing a transaction with Company D, including the risk that Company D did not have equity commitment
letters at this time to fund its proposed purchase price, which made its ability to finance a transaction less certain than Silicon Labs,
and the significant risks associated with obtaining regulatory approvals for a transaction with Company D that were not at all present
in entering into a transaction with Silicon Labs.  The Company Board considered the risks inherent in the CFIUS review of a
transaction with Company D, including the then-current environment surrounding CFIUS review and the results of recent transaction
reviews undertaken by CFIUS, including those in the semiconductor industry with purchasers of a similar profile to Company D.  The
Company Board also considered the risks inherent in additional foreign currency and investment control approvals that Company D
would be required to obtain from regulatory agencies in China in order to acquire the Company.  The Company Board considered that
the amount of the reverse termination fee in Company D’s offer was not sufficient to compensate the Company for the harm to its
business that could result from termination of a deal with Company D due to failure to obtain CFIUS or other regulatory approvals.  In
addition, the Company Board considered the length of time it would take for CFIUS to review any proposed transaction with
Company D and to obtain other required regulatory approvals, which were not required in a transaction with Silicon Labs. After
discussion, the Company Board determined to proceed with Silicon Labs because, among other reasons, the transaction with Silicon
Labs had a significantly greater degree of deal certainty, fewer regulatory hurdles and was likely to be consummated on a faster
timeline. The Company Board directed management to execute and deliver the exclusivity agreement with Silicon Labs.
 

Later on August 30, 2017, a representative of Deutsche Bank contacted Company D to inform it of the Company Board’s decision
to enter exclusivity with another party.
 

Later on August 30, 2017, Sigma executed and delivered the exclusivity agreement with Silicon Labs.
 

On August 31, 2017, additional members of Silicon Labs’ due diligence team were granted access to Sigma’s due diligence
materials.
 

On September 1, 2017, Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank met with Silicon Labs management and
representatives of Morgan Stanley to discuss process and timeline for conducting further due diligence and executing a definitive
agreement and plan of merger. During the month of September 2017, Silicon Labs conducted a due diligence review of Sigma, and the
parties met several times to discuss Sigma, its operations and its several businesses.
 

On September 6, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and a representative of Pillsbury to discuss the current
status of Sigma’s business, its financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and current outlook for the remainder of the
fiscal year. The Company Board discussed the current status of Silicon Labs’ diligence review and its request to speak to parties who
may be potentially interested in purchasing Sigma’s Smart TV business. The Company Board determined not to authorize Silicon
Labs to discuss the divestiture of Sigma’s Smart TV business with third parties.
 

On September 6, 2017, Silicon Labs delivered a first draft of an agreement and plan of merger and a form of voting and support
agreement to Sigma.
 

On September 7, 2017, Sigma announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and financial guidance for the
third quarter of fiscal 2018. Sigma reported net revenue of $39.5 million for the second fiscal quarter, compared to net revenue of
$39.6 million in the prior quarter and $61.3 million in the same period from the prior fiscal year. Sigma also reported a GAAP net loss



9/26/2019 ex_101753.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790715/000143774918004982/sigm20180316_defm14a.htm 94/323

of $12.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to a GAAP net loss of $14.9 million in the previous quarter, and a
GAAP net loss of $1.7 million for the same period in fiscal 2017; and a non-GAAP net loss of $8.8 million for the second quarter of
fiscal 2018, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $9.4 million in the previous quarter, and non-GAAP net income of $2.5 million for
the same period in fiscal 2017. Sigma also announced GAAP gross margin of 47.6% and non-GAAP gross margin of 48.1% for the
second quarter of fiscal 2018; and GAAP operating expenses of $29.8 million and non-GAAP operating expenses of $26.1 million for
the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Sigma’s guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 consisted of total revenues to be in the range of
$37.0 million to $40.0 million, non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 47.0% to 50.0% and non-GAAP operating expenses to
be under $25.0 million.
 

On September 15, 2017, the Company Board met to discuss the current status of communications with Silicon Labs, its due
diligence review and the status of the agreement and plan of merger and form of voting agreement. The Company Board discussed
Silicon Labs’ continued request to meet with third parties who may be interested in purchasing Sigma’s Smart TV business. At this
time, the Company Board did not authorize Silicon Labs to speak with third parties about the potential purchase of Sigma’s Smart TV
business.

In mid-September 2017, Sigma management spoke with Integrated Silicon Solution, Inc., or ISSI, about the potential acquisition
by ISSI of Sigma’s connectivity business.
 

On September 20, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications with Silicon Labs. The Company Board discussed Silicon Labs’ request to develop a
plan to divest Sigma’s Smart TV business and other questions raised in due diligence. The Company Board also discussed a
communication from a representative of Morgan Stanley indicating that Silicon Labs had estimated the shutdown cost of the Smart TV
business as greater than that estimated by Sigma, and as a result, if Sigma was not able to divest the Smart TV business, it was
unlikely that Silicon Labs would proceed with an acquisition of Sigma at the originally proposed purchase price of $7.35 per share.
The Company Board discussed whether to continue to work with Silicon Labs on a potential acquisition of Sigma, the benefits and
challenges of continuing to operate as a standalone business, the alternatives available for divestment of the Smart TV business and
other restructuring alternatives, including restructuring Sigma to operate as an IoT company on a standalone basis. After discussion,
the Company Board directed Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank to meet with Silicon Labs to understand its
concerns regarding additional expenses involved in shutting down the Smart TV business and to discuss the potential divestiture of the
Smart TV business with potentially interested parties.
 

On September 22, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss a potential restructuring of the Smart TV business and a potential divestiture of the Smart TV business. A representative from
Pillsbury provided an update regarding CFIUS and discussed a recent CFIUS rejection of a proposed acquisition in the semiconductor
industry by a China-based buyer. The Company Board discussed how best to maximize shareholder value, including a discussion of
continuing to engage with Silicon Labs on a sale of the entire company, potential divestitures, continuing to operate as a standalone
company (with and without divestitures), the potential shutdown of certain business lines and other potential restructuring activities.
After this discussion, the Company Board determined to continue down the path of a potential sale of the entire company to Silicon
Labs and to work with Silicon Labs to move forward with potential divestitures of the connectivity business and the Smart TV
business. The Company Board also determined to continue to work with a significant customer of the Smart TV business to develop a
plan to wind down the Smart TV business in a profitable manner while maintaining support of its significant customer. The Company
Board discussed the current status of communications with Company D and ISSI for the sale of Sigma’s connectivity business.
 

On September 27, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications with Silicon Labs and other strategic matters. The Company Board discussed recent
communications with Company E regarding the potential divestiture of Sigma’s wired connectivity business. The Company Board
discussed recent communications with a significant customer of Sigma’s Smart TV business to discuss a restructuring of Sigma’s
Smart TV business in a manner that would enable Sigma to operate the Smart TV business at a profit while it ultimately wound down
the Smart TV business.
 

On September 28, 2017, Sigma executed a nondisclosure agreement with ISSI.
 

On September 29, 2017, Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank met with ISSI to discuss Sigma’s wired
connectivity business and a potential transaction.
 

On October 2, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of strategic discussions with a variety of parties. The Company Board discussed the current status of
discussions with Company E regarding the potential divestiture of Sigma’s wired connectivity business, including the current status of
Company E’s diligence review and the expectation that Company E would submit a preliminary, non-binding offer to purchase this
business. The Company Board discussed the current status of communications with a significant customer regarding the amendment
or termination of an agreement with this customer, which agreement had been identified by Silicon Labs as an issue in diligence. The
Company Board discussed the current status of communications with Silicon Labs, including the fact that Silicon Labs had indicated it
continued to be interested in acquiring Sigma, but only if Sigma addressed the concerns previously raised by Silicon Labs, including a
divestiture or more satisfactory wind down of the multimedia business, termination of a specified customer agreement and the
repatriation of cash from Israel. The Company Board approved the request from Silicon Labs to extend exclusivity for one week. The
Company Board discussed the operating expense reduction plan for the multimedia business and other restructuring activities.
 

In early October, Sigma initiated discussions with Company I (a strategic party) for the potential purchase by Company I of
Sigma’s Smart TV and set-top box businesses.
 

On October 4, 2017, Sigma and Silicon Labs agreed to extend the exclusivity period until October 9, 2017 and amended the terms
of the exclusivity agreement to formally permit Sigma to engage in discussions with third parties regarding the potential divestiture of
the Smart TV business and the connectivity business.

On October 5, 2017, Company E submitted a preliminary nonbinding indication of interest to purchase Sigma’s wired
connectivity business. Company E requested a 21-day exclusivity period.
 

On October 5, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss Sigma’s restructuring plans and the current status of strategic discussions. The Company Board discussed an operating
expense reduction plan and the impact of such a plan on Sigma’s anticipated financial performance. The Company Board discussed

want to move forward with the proposed acquisition of the entire company at the previously indicated offer price, but only if certain
key conditions could be met, including the amendment or termination of a specified customer contract and the divestitures or
satisfactory wind down of the Smart TV business. The Company Board authorized Sigma management to execute a 30-day extension

Between November 20, 2017 and December 5, 2017, representatives of Sigma, Deutsche Bank, Pillsbury, Silicon Labs, Morgan
Stanley and Silicon Labs’ legal counsel met on several occasions with Company I to negotiate a definitive agreement for the
divestiture of the Smart TV and set-top box businesses to Company I.
 

On November 22, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss various strategic matters. The Company Board discussed the current status of Silicon Labs’ due diligence review, including
recent business updates that Sigma had provided to Silicon Labs. The Company Board discussed the current status of Sigma’s
business, its financial performance to date in the current fiscal quarter and its updated outlook for the near-term and long-term. The
Company Board discussed the current trends in the business and the need to update Sigma’s current set of projections to take into
account current expectations and business trends. The Company Board discussed the current progress related to the potential
termination or amendment of a specified agreement. The Company Board discussed the current status of negotiations with ISSI related
to the divestiture of Sigma’s wired connectivity business, and the Company Board directed Sigma management to focus on
negotiations with ISSI instead of Company E, including the negotiation of a definitive agreement with ISSI. The Company Board
noted that the current offer terms from Company E were less favorable than those from ISSI, including a smaller purchase price and
less deal certainty as a result of certain conditions that Company E would require Sigma to satisfy prior to consummation of its
proposed transaction to acquire the wired connectivity business. Mr. Tran then left the meeting, and the remaining Company Board
members discussed the current status of discussions with Company I, including the proposed terms of a letter of intent for the
divestiture of Sigma’s Smart TV and set-top box businesses to Company I. The remaining members of the Company Board authorized
Sigma to execute the non-binding, preliminary term sheet with Company I.
 

On November 29, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss recent communications with Silicon Labs and other strategic matters. Mr. Manniche reported on his conversation with Silicon
Labs management during which Silicon Labs management conveyed the results of its due diligence review of Sigma, its view of the
proposed wind down and potential divestiture of Sigma’s Smart TV and set-top box businesses and its view of the current trajectory of
Sigma’s business, including a softening of the Z-Wave business in the third fiscal quarter and the unexpected cancellation of a large
order from a Z-Wave customer, which in turn lowered expectations for the Z-Wave business in the fourth fiscal quarter. Silicon Labs
also expressed concern regarding the projected cash balance of Sigma and potential challenges in repatriating cash located outside of
the United States. As a result, Silicon Labs decreased its offer to acquire Sigma from $7.35 per share to $6.85 per share. Silicon Labs
also indicated that it was critical that a specified agreement be terminated for Silicon Labs to move forward with an acquisition of
Sigma. Silicon Labs requested that the exclusivity period be extended for an additional week so that the parties could finalize
definitive documentation reflecting Silicon Labs’ updated offer. The Company Board discussed the revised offer from Silicon Labs
and the status of discussions for the potential termination of a specified agreement. The Company Board determined to reject the
reduced offer price from Silicon Labs and to discuss the status of certain other potential divestitures. The Company Board also
discussed an extension to the exclusivity period with Silicon Labs until December 7, 2017, so that the parties could attempt to reach a
final agreement.
 

Between November 29, 2017 and December 1, 2017, Sigma and Silicon Labs continued to negotiate the purchase price for Silicon
Labs’ acquisition of Sigma.
 

On December 1, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and a representative of Pillsbury to discuss Sigma’s
performance for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and strategic matters. The Company Board discussed the financial results for the third
quarter of fiscal 2018 and proposed guidance for Sigma’s fourth quarter financial results that would be disclosed on Sigma’s earnings
call scheduled for December 7, 2017. In light of the declining status of Sigma’s business and its proposed guidance downward for the
fourth quarter, the Company Board believed it was in the best interest of Sigma and its shareholders to attempt to reach a definitive
agreement with Silicon Labs. The Company Board discussed the status of negotiations with Silicon Labs, the status of discussions to
terminate a specified agreement and the request of Silicon Labs to extend the exclusivity agreement until December 7, 2017. The
Company Board approved the extension to the exclusivity agreement and determined to continue to negotiate with Silicon Labs. Mr.
Tran then left the meeting, and the remaining Company Board members discussed the status of communications with Company I and
determined to continue to negotiate with Company I for the divestiture of Sigma’s Smart TV and set-top box businesses. The
independent directors of the Company Board also discussed the operations of Sigma if a definitive agreement could not be reached
with Silicon Labs.
 

On December 1, 2017, Sigma and Company I executed a preliminary, non-binding term sheet for the divestiture of Sigma’s Smart
TV and set-top box businesses. The parties proceeded to negotiate the terms of a definitive agreement based on the terms set forth in
the summary of terms.

Also on December 1, 2017, Sigma and Silicon Labs agreed to extend the exclusivity period until December 7, 2017.
 

On December 4, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of communications with Silicon Labs and Company I. The Company Board discussed the progress of
negotiations with Company I and whether a definitive agreement could be reached with Company I for the divestiture of the Smart TV
and set-top box businesses by December 7, 2017. At this time, the Company Board did not believe a definitive agreement could be
reached with Company I before December 7, 2017. The Company Board discussed the status of Sigma’s attempt to terminate a
specified agreement, and it concluded that the agreement would not be terminated by December 7, 2017. The Company Board
discussed the current status of discussions with Silicon Labs and the potential impact of Sigma’s inability to reach a definitive
agreement with Company I and to terminate a specified agreement. The Company Board discussed the current status of its
negotiations related to the offer price to be paid by Silicon Labs in the acquisition of Sigma, noting that the parties had not yet agreed
on a revised purchase price. Mr. Tran then left the meeting, and the remaining Company Board members discussed the status of
communications with Company I.
 

Between December 4, 2017 and December 7, 2017, Sigma and its representatives negotiated the terms of the Agreement and the
Voting Agreement with Silicon Labs and its representatives. Sigma notified Silicon Labs that it would not reach an agreement with
Company I before December 7, 2017 and would not succeed in terminating a specified agreement by December 7, 2017. Among the
principal terms that were negotiated between Sigma and Silicon Labs between December 4 and December 7, 2017, the parties reached
a preliminary agreement to set the consideration to be paid by Silicon Labs in the Merger at $7.05 per share and to add certain closing
conditions to the Merger related to the potential divestiture or wind down of the Smart TV business by December 14, 2017, which we
refer to as the TV Condition, the termination or amendment of a specified agreement by January 22, 2018, which we refer to as the
Contract Condition, and a requirement that Sigma hold at least $40 million of cash and cash equivalents as of the closing of the
Merger. Silicon Labs and Sigma also agreed that if any of these specified closing conditions were not met by the specified date, which
date could be extended by agreement of the parties, then the parties would instead consummate the sale of all of the assets related to
Sigma’s Z-Wave business and all of the equity interest of specified Sigma subsidiaries that operate the Z-Wave Business, subject to the
conditions set forth in the Agreement, for a total purchase price of $240 million in cash.
 

On December 6, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the proposed acquisition of Sigma by Silicon Labs. The representative from Pillsbury began the meeting by advising the
directors of their fiduciary duties in the context of considering a sale of the company or substantially all of its assets. The
representatives of Deutsche Bank then joined the meeting. The representative from Pillsbury provided a detailed presentation
regarding the terms of the Agreement. Representatives of Deutsche Bank reviewed the process undertaken by the Company Board to
evaluate strategic alternatives which included outreach to over 17 parties, consisting of over ten strategic parties and over seven
financial sponsors, to discuss a potential acquisition of Sigma, which ultimately resulted in eight companies presenting non-binding
offers to acquire Sigma. The process also resulted in multiple offers to purchase certain businesses of Sigma. Representatives of
Deutsche Bank then reviewed and discussed with the Company Board certain financial analyses with respect to the consideration of
$7.05 per share proposed to be paid by Silicon Labs in the Merger. Management then reviewed the rationale for the transaction, the
robust sales process, the prospects, risks and benefits of the proposed transaction with Silicon Labs as well as the prospects, risks and
benefits of Sigma remaining as a standalone entity, the consideration offered by Silicon Labs and deal certainty matters. The Company
Board then discussed the standalone prospects of Sigma and the risks and benefits of remaining a standalone company. The Company
Board, with input from Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury, then discussed at length the
alternative structure of the Asset Sale, compared this structure to the Merger, the alternative of having no agreement either for the
Merger or the Asset Sale, the consequences of consummating the Asset Sale instead of the Merger to the continuing business of
Sigma, the impact to Sigma’s shareholders of the Asset Sale relative to the Merger, including but not limited to the timing of receipt of
any consideration related to the transactions, the $240 million purchase price in the Asset Sale and certain financial information
related to such purchase price. The Company Board determined to reconvene the following day once the Agreement and Voting
Agreements were negotiated, so that the Company Board could make a final determination on whether or not to enter into the
Agreement with Silicon Labs.
 

Later on December 6, 2017 through December 7, 2017, Sigma and Silicon Labs and their respective advisors finalized the
negotiations of the Agreement and the Voting Agreement.

On December 7, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the proposed transaction with Silicon Labs. The representative from Pillsbury reviewed the directors’ fiduciary duties in the
context of considering a sale of the company or substantially all of its assets. After this review, the representatives of Deutsche Bank
joined the meeting. The representatives of Deutsche Bank reviewed and discussed with the Company Board certain financial analyses
with respect to the merger consideration of $7.05 per share and rendered an oral opinion to the Company Board, confirmed by delivery
of a written opinion dated December 7, 2017, to the effect that as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations, qualifications and conditions on the review undertaken in
connection therewith, as described in Deutsche Bank’s opinion, the consideration of $7.05 per share in cash was fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Shares (other than Silicon Labs and its affiliates). The opinion of Deutsche Bank is more fully
described below under the heading “ —Opinions of Sigma’s Financial Advisor — Opinion of Sigma’s Financial Advisor, dated
December 7, 2017, provided to the Company Board in connection with evaluation of the Merger.” The Company Board discussed,
with input from management, the standalone prospects of Sigma and the risks and benefits of remaining a standalone company. The
Company Board discussed the alternative Asset Sale, the likelihood of whether the specified closing conditions would be met, which
conditions if not met would trigger the Asset Sale and relative benefits and challenges of consummating the Asset Sale and impact on
subsequent operations of Sigma and its shareholders. The Company Board discussed with representatives of Deutsche Bank the
possibility of obtaining a fairness opinion related to the purchase price of $240 million in cash to be paid to Sigma in the Asset Sale
alternative and determined that it was not practical to receive such an opinion due to the limited amount of time and the process that
would be required by Deutsche Bank to be in a position to render such an opinion. As a result, the Company Board spent a
considerable amount of time discussing its own belief and judgment, taking into account preliminary feedback from the
representatives of Deutsche Bank, as to the relative value of the payment of $240 million in cash to Sigma under the alternative Asset
Sale structure, if such structure occurred under the terms of the Agreement. The Company Board held a further discussion of the
proposed transactions with Silicon Labs, the reasons in support of the proposed transaction and the negative factors about the proposed
transaction.
 

Following the discussion, the Company Board unanimously agreed and determined that the Merger and, in the alternative, the
Asset Sale, were advisable and in the best interests of Sigma and its shareholders, and the Company Board voted unanimously to
approve the Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder, including the Merger and, in the alternative, the Asset Sale.
 

The Agreement and the Voting Agreements were executed following the Company Board meeting on December 7, 2017 and the
transaction was announced shortly following the closing of the Nasdaq Stock Market.
 

After the closing of the Nasdaq Stock Market on December 7, 2017, Sigma also announced its financial results for the third
quarter of fiscal 2018. Sigma reported net revenue of $33.9 million for the third fiscal quarter, compared to net revenue of $39.5
million in the prior quarter and $62.7 million in the same period from the prior fiscal year. Sigma also reported a GAAP net loss of
$19.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to a GAAP net loss of $12.7 million in the previous quarter, and GAAP net
income of $0.2 million for the same period in fiscal 2017; and a non-GAAP net loss of $9.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018,
compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $8.8 million in the previous quarter, and non-GAAP net income of $3.3 million for the same
period in fiscal 2017. Sigma also announced GAAP gross margin of 50.5% and non-GAAP gross margin of 54.7% for the third quarter
of fiscal 2018; and GAAP operating expenses of $36.0 million and non-GAAP operating expenses of $27.8 million for the third
quarter of fiscal 2018.
 

From December 7, 2017 to December 11, 2017, Sigma management, with input from the Company Board and together with its
advisors, continued to work with Company I in an attempt to finalize a definitive agreement for the purchase of Sigma’s Smart TV and
set-top box businesses. In parallel, the Company Board and Sigma management continued to take action to wind down the Smart TV
and set-top box businesses in case a definitive agreement with Company I could not be reached in a timely fashion to satisfy the TV
Condition. Sigma management, with assistance from its advisors, also worked with one of Sigma’s customers to discuss the
termination or amendment of a specified agreement in an effort to satisfy the Contract Condition.
 

On December 11, 2017, Company I informed Sigma that it no longer intended to pursue an acquisition of Sigma’s Smart TV and
set-top box businesses.
 

From December 11, 2017 to December 14, 2017, Sigma began to work with its Smart TV and set-top box customers to ensure a
legally compliant and orderly wind down of its Smart TV business. In light of certain complexities to the wind down process, Sigma
was not in a position to wind down the Smart TV and set-top box businesses in satisfaction of the TV Condition by December 14,
2017. During this time period, Sigma continued to work with one of its customers in an effort to satisfy the Contract Condition.
 

On December 13, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and a representatives from Pillsbury to discuss Sigma’s
progress in attempting to satisfy the TV Condition and the Contract Condition.

On December 13, 2017, Sigma sent an initial draft of the definitive agreement for the divestiture of its wired connectivity business
to ISSI. Between December 13, 2017 and February 6, 2018, Sigma continued to negotiate the terms of the definitive agreement with
ISSI.

On December 14, 2017, Silicon Labs agreed to extend the deadline on which Sigma was required to meet the TV Condition from
December 14, 2017 to December 21, 2017.
 

Between December 14, 2017 and December 27, 2017, Sigma continued to work to wind down its Smart TV and set-top box
businesses in an attempt to satisfy the TV Condition. Sigma also continued to work with a customer to amend a specified contract in
an attempt to satisfy the Contract Condition.
 

On December 17, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the status of Sigma’s efforts to satisfy the TV Condition and the Contract Condition.
 

On December 27, 2017, Silicon Labs sent a letter to Sigma indicating Silicon Labs’ position that the TV Condition had not been
satisfied within the time period required by the Agreement.
 

On December 27, 2017, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the letter from Silicon Labs and the current status of Sigma’s efforts to satisfy the TV Condition and the Contract Condition.
 

On December 27, 2017, Sigma informed Silicon Labs that it did not agree with Silicon Labs’ position that the TV Condition had
not been timely satisfied. Between December 27, 2017 and December 29, 2017, Sigma and Silicon Labs engaged in discussions in
regards to whether the TV Condition had been timely satisfied and in the alternative, whether Silicon Labs would agree to an
additional extension of time to allow Sigma to attempt to satisfy such condition.
 

On December 29, 2017, Sigma sent a letter to Silicon Labs confirming the mutual understanding of the parties that
notwithstanding the contents of Silicon Labs’ prior notice, Silicon Labs and Sigma had agreed not to make a final determination on the
satisfaction of the TV Condition at that time so that Sigma could provide additional information regarding the satisfaction of the TV
Condition for Silicon Labs’ review (which information was not available at that time). The parties agreed that a final determination of
the satisfaction of the TV Condition and the Contract Condition would not be made until January 23, 2018, or such earlier date that the
parties otherwise agreed.
 

On December 29, 2017, Mr. Tran sent a preliminary, non-binding proposal to the Company Board to acquire Sigma’s Smart TV
and set-top box businesses.
 

On December 30, 2017, Mr. Tuttle acknowledged receipt of Sigma’s letter delivered on December 29, 2017.
 

From December 30, 2017 to January 23, 2018, Sigma provided additional information to Silicon Labs regarding the status of
Sigma’s wind down of the Smart TV and set-top box businesses and the status of Sigma’s discussions with a customer regarding the
amendment of a specified agreement.
 

On December 31, 2017, the independent directors of the Company Board met with representatives of Deutsche Bank and
Pillsbury to discuss the preliminary, non-binding proposal from Mr. Tran to acquire Sigma’s Smart TV and set-top box businesses and
the current status of Sigma’s wind down efforts of these businesses and the discussions with a customer to amend a specified
agreement. The independent directors determined that the sale of the Smart TV and set-top box businesses to Mr. Tran, instead of
completing a wind down of those businesses could reasonably be expected to be in the best interest of Sigma and its shareholders if
terms acceptable to Sigma could be negotiated. However, the independent directors also determined that Mr. Tran would have a
conflict of interest if he were to negotiate such a transaction while he was serving as the President, Chief Executive Officer and as a
director. Following the meeting of the independent directors, Mr. Dodson advised Mr. Tran that the independent directors would be
interested in exploring a potential transaction to divest the Smart TV and set-top box businesses to Mr. Tran, but only if Mr. Tran were
to resign his employment and as a director with Sigma. Mr. Tran indicated he would consider taking such action.
 

On January 2, 2018, Sigma executed an exclusivity agreement with ISSI in which Sigma agreed to negotiate exclusively with ISSI
regarding the sale of Sigma’s wired connectivity business until January 23, 2018.
 

On January 4, 2018, the independent directors of the Company Board met with representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to
discuss the current status of Sigma’s efforts to satisfy the TV Condition and the Contract Condition. The Company Board also
discussed the status of discussions with ISSI related to the divestiture of Sigma’s wired connectivity business.
 

On January 5, 2018, Mr. Tran delivered a non-binding letter of intent and additional information about his financing capabilities to
acquire the Smart TV and set-top box businesses. Following receipt of this letter of intent, Mr. Dodson informed Mr. Tran that the
independent directors would review his letter of intent, but would only negotiate the terms of the letter of intent if Mr. Tran resigned
from his positions at Sigma.

On January 10, 2018, Mr. Tran informed the independent directors that although he believed it was possible to avoid conflicts of
interest around his potential purchase of the Smart TV and set-top box businesses by putting in place processes to ensure that that
Sigma’s interests were safeguarded, he was willing to consider the independent directors’ proposal that he resign from the Company
Board and from all offices that he then held, if (among other things) Sigma were to pay his severance owed under his change in
control and severance agreement for involuntary termination in connection with a change in control.
 

On January 14, 2018, the independent directors of the Company Board met with Elias Nader, Sigma’s Chief Financial Officer, and
representatives of Deutsche Bank and Pillsbury to discuss the current status of Sigma’s efforts to satisfy the TV Condition and the
Contract Condition. The independent directors also discussed the status of discussions with ISSI related to the divestiture of Sigma’s
wired connectivity business and the current status of discussions with Silicon Labs.
 

On January 21, 2018, the Company Board met with Sigma management and representatives of Deutsche Bank, Pillsbury and
Sigma’s tax advisors, Armanino LLP, or Armanino, to discuss the current status of Sigma’s efforts to satisfy the TV Condition and the
Contract Condition. The Company Board discussed the potential switch of the transaction structure from the Merger to the Asset Sale
and discussed the possibility of adopting a plan of liquidation to wind down the company following the completion of the Asset Sale.
A representative from Armanino provided information related to tax matters to the Company Board. The Company Board determined
that if the transaction structure switched, it would explore a plan of liquidation following an Asset Sale. The Company Board also
discussed the status of communications with ISSI regarding the potential divestiture of the wired connectivity business as well as the
status of Mr. Tran’s potential departure from the Company Board. The representative from Pillsbury advised the Company Board on
its fiduciary duties. The Company Board held a discussion regarding communications with Silicon Labs and the status of the proposed
transaction with Silicon Labs.
 

On January 22, 2018, Mr. Manniche and Mr. Dodson met with Mr. Tuttle and Mr. Hollister to discuss the status of Sigma’s efforts
to satisfy the TV Condition and the Contract Condition.
 

On January 23, 2018, Silicon Labs sent a notice to Sigma that the TV Condition and the Contract Condition had not been satisfied
within the time periods required by the Agreement.
 

On January 23, 2018, Sigma issued a press release announcing that due to the initial closing conditions set forth in the Agreement
not being satisfied, Silicon Labs and Sigma would move forward with the sale of Sigma’s Z-Wave business to Silicon Labs for $240
million in an asset transaction, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and contingent upon approval by Sigma’s shareholders. Sigma
also announced its intention to initiate a plan of liquidation following the closing of the sale of the Z-Wave business to Silicon Labs,
and that it was anticipated that such plan would include a substantial initial cash distribution to shareholders.
 

On January 29, 2018, Sigma announced the departure of Mr. Tran from his positions as President and Chief Executive Officer of
Sigma and his resignation from the Company Board. In connection with this departure, Sigma entered into a separation agreement
with Mr. Tran providing him certain severance benefits in exchange for a release of claims and an agreement to continue to perform
certain consulting services primarily related to Sigma’s ongoing negotiations with ISSI.
 

On February 3, 2018, Sigma sent a response letter of intent to Mr. Tran related to his offer to purchase Sigma’s Smart TV and set-
top box businesses, requesting certain changes to his proposal.
 

On February 6, 2018, Sigma executed a Share Purchase Agreement with Integrated Silicon Solution (Cayman), Inc. (“ISSI
Cayman”), an affiliate of ISSI, pursuant to which Sigma, along with its directly wholly-owned subsidiary, Sigma Designs Technology
Singapore Pte. Ltd., agreed to sell all of the issued and outstanding capital shares of Sigma Designs Israel S.D.I. Ltd. for a total
purchase price of $28.0 million, subject to a net working capital adjustment and a holdback of $4.2 million to secure Sigma’s
indemnification obligations under the Share Purchase Agreement. Sigma Israel conducts Sigma’s media connectivity business,
consisting primarily of Sigma’s HomePNA and G.hn product lines.
 

On February 6, 2018, Mr. Tran sent a response letter of intent to Sigma related to his offer to purchase Sigma’s Smart TV and set-
top box businesses, requesting certain changes to the prior proposal from Sigma. Since February 6, 2018, Sigma and Mr. Tran have
negotiated the terms of his proposal to acquire Sigma’s Smart TV and set-top box businesses, but have been unable to reach a
preliminary agreement on terms at this time.
 

On February 15, 2018, Sigma closed the transaction contemplated by the Share Purchase Agreement with ISSI Cayman. The cash
received by Sigma at the closing, after giving effect to the net working capital adjustment and the $4.2 million holdback to secure
indemnification obligations of Sigma, was approximately $23.5 million.

Recommendation of the Company Board; Reasons for the Asset Sale
 

Recommendation of the Company Board
 

The Company Board has unanimously determined that the Asset Sale, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Agreement, is fair to, and in the best interests of, Sigma and its shareholders, and approved and declared advisable the Asset Sale and
the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.
 

Shareholders will not know at the time of voting the amount of consideration they will receive. In addition, only shareholders of
record as of the record date for a distribution as determined by the Company Board will be entitled to receive that distribution.
 

Accordingly, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Agreement, the Company Board unanimously recommends that
our shareholders vote “FOR” the Asset Sale Proposal, “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal and “FOR” the Golden Parachute
Compensation Proposal.
 

Reasons for the Asset Sale
 

In evaluating the Asset Sale and the Agreement, the Company Board consulted with management and Sigma’s legal and financial
advisors. In reaching its decision that the Asset Sale is advisable, and in reaching its recommendation that the shareholders approve
the Asset Sale, the Company Board considered a number of factors, including the following material factors, which the Company
Board viewed as supporting its recommendation:
 

 
● the amount of consideration to be received from the Asset Sale, including the assumption of certain liabilities of the Z-Wave

business by Silicon Labs;
 

 
● the $240 million of cash consideration exceeded the Company’s total enterprise value by approximately 60%, based on the

Company’s closing price per share on the date the Agreement was executed;
 

 
● the certainty of the value of the $240 million of cash consideration given the absence of holdbacks or post-closing valuation

adjustments;
 

 
● the Company’s ability to utilize its tax attributes to substantially reduce the amount of U.S. federal income tax from the Asset

Sale;
 

 
● the determination that the Asset Sale is more favorable to Sigma’s shareholders than any other strategic transaction

reasonably available to the Company, which determination was made after conducting an extensive review of strategic
alternatives, and taking into account:

 o the feedback from alternative potential acquirers of the Company as a whole or of certain assets of the Company;

 
o the perceived low likelihood that any such parties would engage in a business combination or asset purchase with

Sigma on the same or similar time frame as Silicon Labs, and with a value and contractual terms and conditions
superior to those contained in the Agreement; and

 o the value, timing, risk allocation and other terms and conditions negotiated with Silicon Labs;
 

 
● the anticipated timing of the consummation of the Asset Sale which, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the applicable

conditions set forth in the Agreement, should allow the Company to receive the consideration for the Asset Sale in a
relatively short time frame;
 

 
● the Company Board’s assessment, after discussions with management and the Company’s advisors, of the risks of remaining

an independent pure-play IoT company and pursuing its initiative to wind down the Smart TV and Set-top Box businesses
and other business objectives, including the risks (such risks are not intended to be exhaustive) relating to:

 o the Company’s recent and projected declining revenue;
 o the Company’s recent and projected losses;

 
o competing against larger or more diversified companies with substantially greater financial resources and capacity to

invest in the development and marketing of new products and technologies;

 
o continuing uncertainty in macro-economic conditions in the United States and around the world, and the potential

impact of these conditions on the Company’s business and prospects as an independent company; and

 
o the risks and uncertainties with respect to the ability to remain competitive in the consolidating semiconductor

industry, and the other risks set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year 2017, and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q;

● the likelihood that the consideration from the Asset Sale would, subject to our satisfaction of and compliance with existing

and future obligations, and appropriate reserves, ultimately allow the Company Board to return a substantial portion of the
net proceeds from the Asset Sale to our shareholders in the form of a cash distribution;
 

 
● the conditions to the Asset Sale, and that, in the case of the condition related to the accuracy of the Company’s

representations and warranties, are generally subject to a “material adverse effect” qualification, except in the case of certain
specific representations;
 

 ● the lack of any required regulatory approval for the Asset Sale;
 

 ● the fact that Silicon Labs requires no financing to consummate the Asset Sale;
 

 

● the possibility of obtaining a fairness opinion from Deutsche Bank with respect to the consideration to be received in the
Asset Sale at a later date, and the preliminary feedback from Deutsche Bank as to the relative value of the $240 million in
cash to be received by Sigma in the Asset Sale, which opinion was delivered prior to the shareholder vote with respect to the
Asset Sale;
 

 
● in the event Deutsche Bank had been unable to render an opinion with respect to the fairness of the $240 million in cash to be

received by Sigma in the Asset Sale, the fact that the Company Board would have been able to disclose such information to
the holders of Company Common Stock prior to the shareholder vote with respect to the Asset Sale;
 

 

● the ability of the Company, under certain circumstances, to consider and respond to a superior proposal for an acquisition
transaction from a third party prior to the closing of the Asset Sale, and the right of the Company Board, after complying with
the terms of the Agreement, to terminate the Agreement in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior
proposal, upon payment of a termination fee of $11.5 million to Silicon Labs, which termination fee the Company Board
determined would not unduly deter a superior proposal and would be reasonable under the circumstances; and
 

 
● the fact that completion of the Asset Sale requires the approval of holders of a majority of the Company Common Stock,

which ensures that the Asset Sale would be supported by a significant portion of our shareholders.
 
The Company Board also considered potentially negative factors concerning the Asset Sale and the Agreement, including the

following:

 
● the fact that our shareholders would lose the opportunity to participate in any possible future earnings or growth contributed

by, or potential business opportunities related to, the Z-Wave business following completion of the Asset Sale, and that the
value of the Company Common Stock may decline following consummation of the Asset Sale;
 

 
● the cash consideration would be taxable to the Company, and distributions to shareholders, if and when made, would be

taxable to shareholders if not in connection with a plan of liquidation of the Company;
 

 
● the fact that, due to timing considerations, it was impracticable to obtain, at the time the Asset Sale was approved by the

Company Board, an opinion from Deutsche Bank as to the fairness of the proposed consideration in the Asset Sale;
 

 

● the risks and costs to the Company if the Asset Sale does not close, including the diversion of management and employee
attention away from the day-to-day operations of the Company, employee attrition, the effect on the Company’s relationships
with customers, partners and others that do business with the Company and the operational restrictions imposed on the
Company pursuant to the Agreement between signing and the closing, which restrictions may prevent Sigma from
undertaking business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the Asset Sale, among other potential negative
effects on the Company;
 

 
● if the Asset Sale is not consummated, the Company will have incurred significant expenses without any offsetting

consideration;

● the fact that certain of the Company’s current and former executive officers and directors have interests in the Asset Sale that
may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of our shareholders including that, as a result of the terms of their
employment agreements and equity awards, certain of the Company’s current and former executive officers may receive
other payments in connection with or following the Asset Sale;
 

 
● the Agreement provides for a termination fee of $11.5 million that would become payable by the Company under certain

circumstances, including if the Company terminates the Agreement to accept a superior proposal; and
 

 
● the Agreement restricts the Company’s ability to solicit competing proposals, subject to certain exceptions to allow the

Company Board to exercise its fiduciary duties.
 

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Company Board is intended to be illustrative and not
exhaustive, but includes the material reasons and factors considered. In view of the wide variety of reasons and factors considered, the
Company Board did not find it practical to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specified factors
considered in reaching its determinations or the reasons for such determinations. Individual directors may have given differing weights
to different factors or may have had different reasons for their ultimate determination. In addition, the Company Board did not reach
any specific conclusion with respect to any of the factors or reasons considered. Instead, the Company Board conducted an overall
analysis of the factors and reasons described above and determined that, in the aggregate, the potential benefits considered outweighed
the potential risks or possible negative consequences of the Asset Sale.
 
Opinions of Sigma’s Financial Advisor
 

Opinion of Sigma’s Financial Advisor, dated December 7, 2017, provided to the Company Board in connection with its
evaluation of the Merger
 

At the December 7, 2017 meeting of the Company Board, Deutsche Bank, financial advisor to Sigma, rendered its oral opinion to
the Company Board, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated December 7, 2017 to the effect that, as of the date of such
opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations, qualifications
and conditions on the review undertaken in connection therewith, as described in Deutsche Bank’s opinion, the consideration of $7.05
in cash per share of Company Common Stock to be received by holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Silicon Labs and its affiliates).
 

The full text of Deutsche Bank’s written opinion, dated December 7, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations, qualifications and conditions on the review undertaken in connection
with the opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B-1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of
Deutsche Bank’s December 7, 2017 opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of the opinion. Deutsche Bank’s December 7, 2017 opinion was approved and authorized for issuance by a Deutsche Bank
fairness opinion review committee and was addressed to, and was for the use and benefit of, the Company Board in connection
with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the Merger. Deutsche Bank’s December 7, 2017 opinion was limited to the fairness
of the Merger consideration of $7.05 in cash per share to be received by holders of Company Common Stock in the Merger,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Silicon Labs and its affiliates) as of the
date of the opinion. Deutsche Bank’s December 7, 2017 opinion did not address any other terms of the Merger, the Agreement
(including the closing conditions contained therein) or any other agreement entered into or to be entered into in connection
with the Merger or the Restructuring. Nor did Deutsche Bank’s December 7, 2017 opinion express any opinion with respect to
the Asset Sale alternative contemplated by the Agreement (including the consideration to be received by Sigma in connection
with any such asset purchase). The Company Board did not ask Deutsche Bank to, and Deutsche Bank’s December 7, 2017
opinion did not, address the fairness of the Merger, or any consideration received in connection therewith, to the holders of
any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Sigma, nor did it address the fairness of the contemplated
benefits of the Merger. Deutsche Bank expressed no opinion as to the merits of the underlying decision by Sigma to engage in
the Merger or the Restructuring or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any alternative transactions or business
strategies. Nor did Deutsche Bank express an opinion, and Deutsche Bank’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation, as to
how any holder of shares of Company Common Stock should vote with respect to the Merger or any related matter. In
addition, Deutsche Bank did not express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature
of any compensation payable to or to be received by any of Sigma’s officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such
persons, in connection with the Merger, whether relative to the Merger consideration of $7.05 in cash per share or otherwise.

No limitations were imposed by the Company Board upon Deutsche Bank with respect to the investigations made or procedures
followed by it in rendering its December 7, 2017 opinion. In connection with its role as financial advisor to Sigma, and in arriving at
its December 7, 2017 opinion, Deutsche Bank reviewed certain publicly available financial and other information concerning Sigma
and certain internal analyses, financial forecasts and other information relating to Sigma prepared by management of Sigma taking
into account the Restructuring, and including Sigma management’s IoT Business Projections summarized under “—The Asset Sale —
Certain Financial Projections” beginning on page 70. The capitalized term Restructuring refers to the TV Divestiture, the divestiture
of the Company’s Wired Connectivity Business and other restructuring activities and one-time expenses as contemplated by Sigma at
the time that the IoT Business Projections were prepared. Deutsche Bank also held discussions with certain senior officers and other
representatives and advisors of Sigma regarding the businesses and prospects of Sigma. In addition, Deutsche Bank:
 
 ● reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock;
 

 
● compared certain financial and stock market information for Sigma with, to the extent publicly available, similar information

for certain other companies it considered relevant whose securities are publicly traded;
 

 
● reviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain recent business combinations which Deutsche Bank

deemed relevant;
 
 ● reviewed the Agreement; and
 
 ● performed such other studies and analyses and considered such other factors as Deutsche Bank deemed appropriate.
 

Deutsche Bank did not assume responsibility for independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any information,
whether publicly available or furnished to it, concerning Sigma, including, without limitation, any financial information considered in
connection with the rendering of its December 7, 2017 opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of its December 7, 2017 opinion, Deutsche
Bank, with the knowledge and permission of the Company Board, assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such
information. Deutsche Bank did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and did not prepare, obtain or
review any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or off-balance-
sheet assets or liabilities), of Sigma, Silicon Labs or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor did Deutsche Bank evaluate the solvency
or fair value of Sigma, Silicon Labs or any of their respective subsidiaries (or the impact of the Merger thereon) under any law relating
to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. With respect to the financial forecasts made available to Deutsche Bank and used in its
analyses, Deutsche Bank assumed with the knowledge and permission of the Company Board that such forecasts had been reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Sigma as to the matters
covered thereby. At the direction of the Company Board, Deutsche Bank assumed that the Restructuring would be consummated as
reflected (and on the terms assumed) in the IoT Business Projections. In rendering its December 7, 2017 opinion, Deutsche Bank
expressed no view as to the reasonableness of such forecasts and the IoT Business Projections or the assumptions on which they were
based, including with respect to the Restructuring. Deutsche Bank’s December 7, 2017 opinion was necessarily based upon economic,
market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of its opinion. Deutsche Bank
expressly disclaimed any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting its opinion of
which it becomes aware after the date of its opinion.
 

For purposes of rendering its December 7, 2017 opinion, Deutsche Bank assumed, with the knowledge and permission of the
Company Board, that in all respects material to its analysis, the Merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement, without any waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement that would be material to Deutsche
Bank’s analysis and that the Restructuring would be consummated as reflected (and on the terms assumed) in the IoT Business
Projections. Deutsche Bank also assumed, with the knowledge and permission of the Company Board, that all material governmental,
regulatory or other approvals and consents required in connection with the consummation of the Merger will be obtained and that, in
connection with obtaining any necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents, no restrictions, terms or conditions
will be imposed that would be material to its analysis. Deutsche Bank is not a legal, regulatory, tax or accounting expert and has relied
on the assessments made by Sigma and its other advisors with respect to such issues.
 

Summary of Material Financial Analyses of Deutsche Bank in connection with its December 7, 2017 Opinion
 

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Deutsche Bank to the Company Board at its meeting
held on December 7, 2017, and that were used in connection with rendering its December 7, 2017 opinion described above.

The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Deutsche
Bank, nor does the order in which the analyses are described below represent the relative importance or weight given to the analyses
by Deutsche Bank. Some of the summaries of financial analyses below include information presented in tabular format. In order to
fully understand the analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a
complete description of Deutsche Bank’s analyses. Considering the data described below without considering the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on
market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before December 6, 2017, and is not necessarily indicative of current market
conditions. For purposes of the analyses relating to Sigma described below, Sigma’s fiscal year-end of approximately January 31 was
assumed to be equivalent to a calendar year-end of the prior December 31.
 

In preparing its analyses, Deutsche Bank utilized calculations of, among other things total enterprise value (“TEV”). In so doing,
Deutsche Bank assumed, based on input from Sigma management, that Sigma would complete the Restructuring and continue to
operate only the IoT Business (which included both the Z-Wave business and the Mobile IoT business). In order to estimate the
implied equity value for the entire company, Deutsche Bank estimated the value of the IoT Business on a going concern basis and
adjusted it for cash, net of the estimated impact of the Restructuring, in each case as provided by Sigma management. The financial
forecasts or estimates for Sigma provided to Deutsche Bank by Sigma management are described under “—The Asset Sale —Certain
Financial Projections” beginning on page 70 of this proxy statement.
 
Selected Companies Analysis
 

Deutsche Bank reviewed and compared certain financial information and commonly used valuation measurements for Sigma with
corresponding financial information and valuation measurements for the following publicly traded companies in the Internet of Things
semiconductor (“IoT Semiconductor”) industry.
 

AMS Technologies AG
Nordic Semiconductor ASA
Sequans Communications SA
Silicon Laboratories Inc.
u-Blox Holding AG

 
Although none of the above selected companies is directly comparable to Sigma, for the purpose of selecting the companies for

this analysis, Deutsche Bank utilized its professional judgment and experience as investment bankers, taking into account several
factors, including, among other things, Sigma’s operational capabilities and financial profile compared with those of the selected
companies, the competitive landscape in which Sigma and the selected companies operate and Sigma’s product offerings and those of
the selected companies. Accordingly, the analysis of selected publicly traded companies was not simply mathematical. Rather, it
involved complex considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in the December 7, 2017 opinion of Deutsche Bank, concerning
differences in financial and operating characteristics of the selected companies and other factors that could affect the public trading
value of such companies.
 

Based on the closing prices of the common stock or common equity of each of the selected companies on December 6, 2017,
information contained in the most recent public filings of the selected companies and certain estimates reported by selected equity
research analysts of revenue for calendar years 2017 and 2018 for each of the selected companies, Deutsche Bank calculated TEV as a
multiple of calendar years 2017 and 2018 estimated revenue.
 

Deutsche Bank also calculated the same multiples for Sigma based upon the Merger consideration of $7.05 per share of Company
Common Stock and Sigma management estimates of calendar years 2017 and 2018 revenue (assuming completion of the
Restructuring).
 

The results of this analysis are summarized as follows:
 

  
TEV /

Revenue  
  2017E   2018E  
         
Selected Companies         

AMS Technologies AG   7.3x    4.8x

Based in part upon the multiples of the selected companies described above and taking into account its professional judgment and
experience, Deutsche Bank calculated the following ranges of implied values per share of Company Common Stock (assuming
completion of the Restructuring) on a fully diluted basis:
 

 
● approximately $5.09 to $6.34 per share of Company Common Stock by applying multiples of 3.0x to 4.0x to Sigma

management estimates of calendar year 2017 revenue (assuming completion of the Restructuring); and
 

 
● approximately $5.00 to $6.81 per share of Company Common Stock by applying multiples of 2.0x to 3.0x to Sigma

management estimates of calendar year 2018 revenue (assuming completion of the Restructuring).
 
Selected Transactions Analysis
 

Deutsche Bank reviewed publicly available information relating to the following eleven selected transactions involving enterprise
communications companies announced since January 1, 2012 in the IoT Semiconductor industry (the “selected transactions”).

 
Date Announced  Target  Acquirer

May 21, 2012  Ember Corp.  Silicon Laboratories Inc.
June 7, 2013  Energy Micro AS  Silicon Laboratories Inc.
May 22, 2014  ISSC Technologies Corporation  Microchip Technology Incorporated
July 7, 2014  Newport Media, Inc.  Atmel Corporation
October 15, 2014  CSR plc  Qualcomm Incorporated
February 3, 2015  Bluegiga Technologies Oy.  Silicon Laboratories Inc.
January 19, 2016  Atmel Corporation  Microchip Technology Incorporated
April 28, 2016  Broadcom Limited (Wireless IoT business)  Cypress Semiconductor Corporation
December 21, 2016  InvenSense, Inc.  TDK Corporation
February 13, 2017  GigPeak, Inc.  Integrated Device Technology, Inc.
June 12, 2017  Conexant Systems, LLC  Synaptics Incorporated

 
Although none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the Merger, the companies that participated in the selected

transactions were selected by Deutsche Bank based upon its professional judgment and experience as investment bankers and its
knowledge of transactions of a similar nature and are such that, for purposes of analysis, the selected transactions may be considered
similar to the Merger.
 

With respect to each selected transaction and based on publicly available information, Deutsche Bank calculated the multiples of
the target’s TEV to last 12 months (“LTM”) revenue. Deutsche Bank also calculated the same multiples for the Merger based upon
Sigma management estimates of calendar 2017 revenue (assuming completion of the Restructuring).
 

The results of this analysis are summarized as follows:

Based in part upon the multiples of the selected transactions described above, and taking into account its professional judgment
and experience, Deutsche Bank calculated a range of estimated implied values per share of Company Common Stock by applying
multiples of 3.0x to 4.0x to estimated calendar year 2017 revenue (assuming completion of the Restructuring) provided by
management of Sigma, resulting in a range of implied values of approximately $5.09 to $6.34 per share of Company Common Stock.
 
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
 

Deutsche Bank performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Sigma using financial forecasts and other information and data
provided by Sigma’s management (assuming completion of the Restructuring) to calculate a range of implied net present values per
share of Company Common Stock as of December 6, 2017. In performing the discounted cash flow analysis, Deutsche Bank applied a
range of discount rates of 13.0% to 14.0% to the estimates of after-tax unlevered free cash flows for the calendar years ended
December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2022 that were provided by Sigma’s management (see “—The Asset Sale —Certain
Financial Projections” on page 70), in each case using the mid-year convention, and estimated terminal values using a range of
perpetuity growth rates of 3.0% to 5.0%. For purposes of its financial analyses, Deutsche Bank calculated unlevered free cash flow as
(a) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, but excluding stock based compensation expenses and impairment
and restructuring costs less, (b) stock based compensation expense, less (c) cash taxes, less (d) capital expenditures, less (e) change in
working capital. Deutsche Bank derived the foregoing range of discount rates utilizing a weighted average cost of capital analysis
based on certain financial metrics for Sigma and the selected companies described above under “—Selected Companies Analysis”.
 

This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of Company Common Stock as of December 6, 2017 of approximately
$4.31 to $5.37 per share.
 
Other Information
 

Deutsche Bank also noted for the Company Board certain additional factors that were not considered part of its financial analysis
with respect to its December 7, 2017 opinion but were referenced for informational purposes.
 

Specifically, Deutsche Bank reviewed the historical trading performance of Company Common Stock over the one year period
ended on December 6, 2017. The one year period ending December 6, 2017 indicated low to high closing stock prices for Sigma
common shares of approximately $5.50 to $6.75 per share. Deutsche Bank noted that the consideration of $7.05 in cash per share
represented a premium of approximately 26% to the closing price of $5.60 per share of Company Common Stock on December 6,
2017, a premium of approximately 20% to the one-month average closing price per share of Company Common Stock of $5.88 on
December 6, 2017, a premium of approximately 16% to the three-month average closing price per share of Company Common Stock
of $6.06 on December 6, 2017, a premium of approximately 16% to the one-year average closing price per share of Company
Common Stock of $6.09 on December 6, 2017 and a premium of approximately 4% to the 52-week high closing price per share of
Company Common Stock at $6.75 as of December 6, 2017.
 

Deutsche Bank also reviewed publicly available one-year forward Wall Street research analysts’ stock price targets for shares of
Company Common Stock published between September 8, 2017 and October 12, 2017, which, on an undiscounted basis, ranged from
$4.00 to $10.00 per share, with a mean of $7.50 per share and a median of $8.00 per share.
 
Miscellaneous
 

This summary is not a complete description of Deutsche Bank’s December 7, 2017 opinion or the underlying analyses and factors
considered in connection with Deutsche Bank’s December 7, 2017 opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process
involving the application of subjective business and financial judgment in determining the most appropriate and relevant methods of
financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to
partial analysis or summary description. Deutsche Bank believes that its analyses described above must be considered as a whole and
that considering any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered without considering all analyses and factors could create a
misleading view of the process underlying its December 7, 2017 opinion. Selecting portions of the analyses or summary set forth
above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the Deutsche Bank
December 7, 2017 opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Deutsche Bank considered the results of all of its analyses and did
not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis. Rather, it made its fairness determination on the basis of its experience and
professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction in the analyses described above is
identical to Sigma or the Merger.

In conducting its analyses and arriving at its December 7, 2017 opinion, Deutsche Bank utilized a variety of generally accepted
valuation methods. The analyses were prepared solely for the purpose of enabling Deutsche Bank to provide its December 7, 2017
opinion to the Company Board as to the fairness of the consideration of $7.05 in cash per share to be received by holders of Company
Common Stock in the Merger, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Silicon Labs and
its affiliates) as of the date of such opinion and do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or
securities actually may be sold, which are inherently subject to uncertainty. As described above, in connection with its analyses,
Deutsche Bank made, and was provided by the management of Sigma with, numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Deutsche Bank or
Sigma. Analyses based on estimates or forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual, past or future values or
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Because such analyses are inherently
subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of Sigma or its respective advisors, Deutsche
Bank does not assume responsibility if future results or actual values are materially different from these forecasts or assumptions.
 

The terms of the Merger, including the Merger consideration, were determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Sigma
and Silicon Labs and were approved by the Company Board. Although Deutsche Bank provided advice to the Company Board during
the course of these negotiations, the decision to enter into the Agreement was solely that of the Company Board.
 

Deutsche Bank did not recommend any specific consideration to Sigma or the Company Board, or that any specific amount or
type of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the transaction. As described above, the December 7, 2017
opinion of Deutsche Bank and its December 7, 2017 presentation to the Company Board were among a number of factors taken into
consideration by the Company Board in making its determination to approve the Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereunder.
 

Opinion of Sigma’s Financial Advisor, dated February 15, 2018, provided to the Company Board in connection with its
evaluation of making a recommendation to the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Asset Sale
 

At the February 15, 2018 meeting of the Company Board, Deutsche Bank rendered its oral opinion to the Company Board,
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 15, 2018 to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon
and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations, qualifications and conditions on the
review undertaken in connection therewith, as described in Deutsche Bank’s opinion, the consideration of $240 million to be received
by Sigma in the Asset Sale was fair, from a financial point of view, to the Company.
 

The full text of Deutsche Bank’s written opinion, dated February 15, 2018, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations, qualifications and conditions on the review undertaken in connection
with the opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B-2 and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of
Deutsche Bank’s February 15, 2018 opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of the opinion. Deutsche Bank’s February 15, 2018 opinion was approved and authorized for issuance by a Deutsche Bank
fairness opinion review committee and was addressed to, and was for the use and benefit of, the Company Board in connection
with and for the purpose of its evaluation of making a recommendation to holders of the Company Common Stock in
connection with the Asset Sale. Deutsche Bank’s opinion was limited to the fairness of the consideration of $240 million to be
received by Sigma in the Asset Sale, from a financial point of view, to the Company as of the date of the opinion. Deutsche
Bank’s February 15, 2018 opinion did not address any other terms of the Asset Sale, the Agreement (including the closing
conditions contained therein) or any other agreement entered into or to be entered into in connection with the Asset Sale. The
Company Board did not ask Deutsche Bank to, and Deutsche Bank’s February 15, 2018 opinion did not, address the fairness
of the Asset Sale, or any consideration received in connection therewith, to the holders of any class of securities, creditors or
other constituencies of Sigma, nor did it address the fairness of the contemplated benefits of the Asset Sale. Deutsche Bank
expressed no opinion as to the merits of the underlying decision by Sigma to engage in the Asset Sale or the relative merits of
the Asset Sale as compared to any alternative transactions or business strategies (including the Merger). Nor did Deutsche
Bank express an opinion, and Deutsche Bank’s opinion did not constitute a recommendation, as to how any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock should vote with respect to the Asset Sale or any other matter. In addition, Deutsche Bank did not
express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to
or to be received by any of Sigma’s officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such persons, in connection with the Asset
Sale, whether relative to the consideration of $240 million to be received by Sigma in the Asset Sale or otherwise. Deutsche
Bank’s February 15, 2018 opinion did not address how Sigma might use such consideration or any action that Sigma might
take following the Asset Sale, including the terms of any liquidation that Sigma might undertake following the Asset Sale.

No limitations were imposed by the Company Board upon Deutsche Bank with respect to the investigations made or procedures
followed by it in rendering its February 15, 2018 opinion. In connection with its role as financial advisor to Sigma, and in arriving at
its February 15, 2018 opinion, Deutsche Bank reviewed certain publicly available financial and other information concerning the Z-
Wave Business and Sigma, and certain internal analyses, financial forecasts and other information relating to the Z-Wave Business and
Sigma prepared by management of Sigma, including the January 2018 Projections summarized under “—The Asset Sale — Certain
Financial Projections” beginning on page 70. Deutsche Bank also held discussions with certain senior officers and other
representatives and advisors of Sigma regarding the businesses and prospects of the Z-Wave Business and Sigma. In addition,
Deutsche Bank:
 

 
● compared certain financial information for the Z-Wave Business with, to the extent publicly available, similar information for

certain other companies it considered relevant whose securities are publicly traded;
 

 
● reviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain recent business combinations which Deutsche Bank

deemed relevant;
 
 ● reviewed the Agreement; and
 
 ● performed such other studies and analyses and considered such other factors as Deutsche Bank deemed appropriate.
 

Deutsche Bank did not assume responsibility for independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any information,
whether publicly available or furnished to it, concerning the Z-Wave Business or Sigma, including, without limitation, any financial
information considered in connection with the rendering of its February 15, 2018 opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of its February
15, 2018 opinion, Deutsche Bank, with the knowledge and permission of the Company Board, assumed and relied upon the accuracy
and completeness of all such information. Deutsche Bank did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and
did not prepare, obtain or review any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (including any contingent,
derivative or off-balance-sheet assets or liabilities), of the Z-Wave Business, Sigma, Silicon Labs or any of their respective
subsidiaries, nor did Deutsche Bank evaluate the solvency or fair value of the Z-Wave Business, Sigma, Silicon Labs or any of their
respective subsidiaries (or the impact of the Asset Sale thereon) under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters.
With respect to the financial forecasts made available to Deutsche Bank and used in its analyses, Deutsche Bank assumed with the
knowledge and permission of the Company Board that such forecasts had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Sigma as to the matters covered thereby. In rendering its February
15, 2018 opinion, Deutsche Bank expressed no view as to the reasonableness of such forecasts and projections or the assumptions on
which they were based. Deutsche Bank’s February 15, 2018 opinion was necessarily based upon economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of its opinion. Deutsche Bank expressly disclaimed
any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting its opinion of which it becomes aware
after the date of its February 15, 2018 opinion.
 

For purposes of rendering its February 15, 2018 opinion, Deutsche Bank assumed, with the knowledge and permission of the
Company Board, that in all respects material to its analysis, the Asset Sale would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement, without any waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement that would be material to Deutsche
Bank’s analysis. Deutsche Bank also assumed, with the knowledge and permission of the Company Board, that all material
governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required in connection with the consummation of the Asset Sale will be
obtained and that, in connection with obtaining any necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents, no
restrictions, terms or conditions will be imposed that would be material to its analysis. Deutsche Bank is not a legal, regulatory, tax or
accounting expert and has relied on the assessments made by Sigma and its other advisors with respect to such issues.
 
Summary of Material Financial Analyses of Deutsche Bank
 

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Deutsche Bank to the Company Board at its meeting
held on February 15, 2018, and that were used in connection with rendering its February 15, 2018 opinion described above.

The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Deutsche
Bank, nor does the order in which the analyses are described below represent the relative importance or weight given to the analyses
by Deutsche Bank. Some of the summaries of financial analyses below include information presented in tabular format. In order to
fully understand the analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a
complete description of Deutsche Bank’s analyses. Considering the data described below without considering the full narrative
description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading
or incomplete view of the analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on
market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before February 14, 2018, and is not necessarily indicative of current market
conditions. For purposes of the analyses relating to the Z-Wave Business described below, Sigma’s fiscal year-end of January 31 was
assumed to be equivalent to a calendar year-end of the prior December 31.
 

In preparing its analyses, Deutsche Bank utilized calculations of, among other things TEV, calculated as equity value plus, if
applicable, minority interest plus net debt. The financial forecasts or estimates for the Z-Wave Business provided to Deutsche Bank by
Sigma management are described under “—The Asset Sale —Certain Financial Projections” beginning on page 70 of this proxy
statement.
 
Selected Companies Analysis
 

Deutsche Bank reviewed and compared certain financial information and commonly used valuation measurements for the Z-Wave
Business with corresponding financial information and valuation measurements for the following publicly traded companies in the IoT
Semiconductor industry.
 

AMS Technologies AG
Nordic Semiconductor ASA
Sequans Communications SA
Silicon Laboratories Inc.
u-Blox Holding AG

 
Although none of the above selected companies is directly comparable to the Z-Wave Business, for the purpose of selecting the

companies for this analysis, Deutsche Bank utilized its professional judgment and experience as investment bankers, taking into
account several factors, including, among other things, the Z-Wave Business’ operational capabilities and financial profile compared
with those of the selected companies, the competitive landscape in which the Z-Wave Business and the selected companies operate
and the Z-Wave Business’ product offerings and those of the selected companies. Accordingly, the analysis of selected publicly traded
companies was not simply mathematical. Rather, it involved complex considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in the
opinion of Deutsche Bank, concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics of the selected companies and other
factors that could affect the public trading value of such companies.
 

Based on the closing prices of the common stock or common equity of each of the selected companies on February 14, 2018,
information contained in the most recent public filings of the selected companies and certain estimates reported by selected equity
research analysts of revenue for calendar years 2017 and 2018 for each of the selected companies, Deutsche Bank calculated TEV as a
multiple of calendar years 2017 and 2018 estimated revenue.
 

Deutsche Bank also calculated the same multiples for the Z-Wave Business based upon the consideration of $240 million to be
received by Sigma in the Asset Sale and Sigma management estimates of calendar years 2017 and 2018 revenue for the Z-Wave
Business.
 

The results of this analysis are summarized as follows:
 

  TEV / Revenue  
  2017E   2018E  
Selected Companies         

AMS Technologies AG   9.6x    5.6x  
Nordic Semiconductor ASA   4.0x    3.3x  
Sequans Communications S.A.   3.0x    2.3x  
Silicon Laboratories Inc.   4.8x    4.4x  
u-Blox Holding AG   3.6x    3.0x  

         
Median   4.0x    3.3x  
Z-Wave Business at $240 million   4.5x    3.5x

Based in part upon the multiples of the selected companies described above and taking into account its professional judgment and
experience, Deutsche Bank calculated the following ranges of implied TEV of the Z-Wave Business:
 

 
● approximately $160 million to $213 million by applying multiples of 3.0x to 4.0x to Sigma management estimates of

calendar year 2017 revenue for the Z-Wave Business; and
 

 
● approximately $138 million to $207 million by applying multiples of 2.0x to 3.0x to Sigma management estimates of

calendar year 2018 revenue for the Z-Wave Business.
 
Selected Transactions Analysis
 

Deutsche Bank reviewed publicly available information relating to the eleven selected transactions described above.
 

Although none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the Asset Sale, the companies that participated in the selected
transactions were selected by Deutsche Bank based upon its professional judgment and experience as investment bankers and its
knowledge of transactions of a similar nature and are such that, for purposes of analysis, the selected transactions may be considered
similar to the Asset Sale.
 

With respect to each selected transaction and based on publicly available information, Deutsche Bank calculated the multiples of
the target’s TEV to LTM revenue. Deutsche Bank also calculated the same multiples for the Asset Sale based upon Sigma
management estimates of calendar 2017 revenue.
 

The results of this analysis are summarized as follows:
 

 

Selected Transactions  
TEV/LTM

Revenue 
High   16.4x 
Median   3.4x 
Low   2.2x 
     
Z-Wave Business at $240 million   4.5x 

 
Based in part upon the multiples of the selected transactions described above, and taking into account its professional judgment

and experience, Deutsche Bank calculated a range of estimated implied TEV of the Z-Wave Business by applying multiples of 3.0x to
4.0x to estimated calendar year 2017 revenue for the Z-Wave Business provided by management of Sigma, resulting in a range of
implied values of approximately $160 million to $213 million for the Z-Wave Business.
 
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis
 

Deutsche Bank performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Z-Wave Business using the January 2018 Projections and other
information and data provided by Sigma’s management to calculate a range of implied net present values of the Z-Wave Business as of
February 14, 2018. In performing the discounted cash flow analysis, Deutsche Bank applied a range of discount rates of 13.5% to
14.5% to the estimates of after-tax unlevered free cash flows for the Z-Wave Business for the calendar years ended December 31,
2018 through December 31, 2022 that were provided by Sigma’s management (see “—The Asset Sale —Certain Financial
Projections” on page 70), in each case using the mid-year convention, and estimated terminal values using a range of perpetuity
growth rates of 3.0% to 5.0%. For purposes of its financial analyses, Deutsche Bank calculated unlevered free cash flow as (a)
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, but excluding stock based compensation expenses and impairment and
restructuring costs less, (b) stock based compensation expense, less (c) cash taxes, less (d) capital expenditures, less (e) change in
working capital. Deutsche Bank derived the foregoing range of discount rates utilizing a weighted average cost of capital analysis
based on certain financial metrics for Sigma and the selected companies described above under “—Selected Companies Analysis”.
 

This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of the Z-Wave Business as of February 14, 2018 of approximately $142
million to $186 million.
 
Miscellaneous
 

This summary is not a complete description of Deutsche Bank’s February 15, 2018 opinion or the underlying analyses and factors
considered in connection with Deutsche Bank’s opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving the

application of subjective business and financial judgment in determining the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Deutsche Bank believes that its analyses described above must be considered as a whole and that
considering any portion of such analyses and of the factors considered without considering all analyses and factors could create a

In conducting its analyses and arriving at its February 15, 2018 opinion, Deutsche Bank utilized a variety of generally accepted
valuation methods. The analyses were prepared solely for the purpose of enabling Deutsche Bank to provide its opinion to the
Company Board as to the fairness of the consideration of $240 million to be received by Sigma in the Asset Sale, from a financial
point of view, to Sigma as of the date of the opinion and do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which
businesses or securities actually may be sold, which are inherently subject to uncertainty. As described above, in connection with its
analyses, Deutsche Bank made, and was provided by the management of Sigma with, numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Deutsche Bank or
Sigma. Analyses based on estimates or forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual, past or future values or
results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. Because such analyses are inherently
subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of Sigma or its respective advisors, Deutsche
Bank does not assume responsibility if future results or actual values are materially different from these forecasts or assumptions.
 

The terms of the Asset Sale, including the consideration to be received by Sigma in the Asset Sale, were determined through
arm’s-length negotiations between Sigma and Silicon Labs and were approved by the Company Board. Although Deutsche Bank
provided advice to the Company Board during the course of these negotiations, the decision to enter into the Agreement was solely
that of the Company Board.
 

Deutsche Bank did not recommend any specific consideration to Sigma or the Company Board, or that any specific amount or
type of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Asset Sale. As described above, the February 15, 2018
opinion of Deutsche Bank and its presentation to the Company Board were among a number of factors taken into consideration by the
Company Board in making its determination to recommend that holders of Company Common Stock vote to approve the Asset Sale.
 

Additional information relating to Deutsche Bank
 

Sigma selected Deutsche Bank as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger and the Asset Sale based on Deutsche
Bank’s qualifications, expertise, reputation and experience in mergers and acquisitions. Pursuant to an engagement letter between
Sigma and Deutsche Bank, dated May 4, 2017 and as amended on February 14, 2018, Sigma has agreed to pay Deutsche Bank a fee
estimated to be approximately $4.4 million for its services as financial advisor to Sigma in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement, of which $500,000 became payable upon delivery of its December 7, 2017 opinion (or would have
become payable if Deutsche Bank had advised the Company Board that it was unable to render its opinion). $250,000 became payable
upon delivery of its February 15, 2018 opinion (or would have become payable if Deutsche Bank had advised the Company Board that
it was unable to render its opinion) and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the Asset Sale. In addition,
Deutsche Bank will be entitled to additional fees in connection with the potential sale of Sigma’s Mobile Internet-of-Things business.
Sigma has also agreed to reimburse Deutsche Bank for the fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel and Deutsche Bank’s travel
and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the Merger or otherwise arising out of its engagement, in each case on
the terms set forth in its engagement letter. Sigma has also agreed to indemnify Deutsche Bank and its affiliates against certain
liabilities in connection with its engagement.
 

Deutsche Bank is an internationally recognized investment banking firm experienced in providing advice in connection with
mergers and acquisitions and related transactions. Deutsche Bank is an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG (together with its affiliates, the
“DB Group”). The DB Group may provide investment and commercial banking services to Silicon Labs, Sigma or their respective
affiliates in the future, for which Deutsche Bank expects the DB Group to receive compensation. In the ordinary course of business,
members of the DB Group may actively trade in the securities and other instruments and obligations of Silicon Labs, Sigma and their
respective affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. Accordingly, the DB Group may at any time hold a
long or short position in such securities, instruments and obligations.

Certain Financial Projections
 

Although Sigma has publicly issued limited short-term guidance concerning certain aspects of its expected financial performance,
it does not, as a matter of course, make public disclosure of detailed forecasts or projections of its expected financial performance for
extended periods due to, among other things, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting future periods; and the likelihood that the
underlying assumptions and estimates may prove incorrect.
 

For its periodic review and assessment of Sigma’s business plan and potential strategic opportunities available to Sigma with the
goal of maximizing shareholder value, in August 2017, our management prepared financial projections for the whole company for the
fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (the “August 2017 WholeCo Projections”). The August 2017 WholeCo Projections were provided to
prospective buyers, including Silicon Labs.
 

In December 2017, our management revised the August 2017 WholeCo Projections (as revised, the “December 2017 WholeCo
Projections”) to reflect third quarter results and management’s then current expectations in light of declining business levels. In
addition, management prepared projections for the Company’s Internet of Things Devices business lines, after giving effect to the
Restructuring for the fiscal years 2018 through 2023 (the “IoT Business Projections” and, together with the December 2017 WholeCo
Projections, the “December 2017 Projections”). The Company Board and management instructed Deutsche Bank to rely on the IoT
Business Projections as the basis for its analyses in rendering its December 7, 2017 opinion as described in more detail in “Opinion of
Sigma’s Financial Advisor, dated December 7, 2017, provided to the Company Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger.”
Silicon Labs was provided with the December 2017 WholeCo Projections.
 

In connection with the potential Asset Sale transaction, in January 2018, our management prepared projections for the Company’s
Z-Wave Business for the fiscal years 2018 through 2023 (the “January 2018 Projections”, and together with the August 2017
WholeCo Projections and the December 2017 Projections, the “Projections”). The Company Board and management instructed
Deutsche Bank to rely on the January 2018 Projections as the basis for its analyses in rendering its February 15, 2018 opinion as
described in more detail above in “Opinion of Sigma’s Financial Advisor, dated February 15, 2018, provided to the Company Board in
connection with its evaluation of making a recommendation to the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Asset
Sale.” With respect to the January 2018 Projections, only the projections for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 were provided to Silicon Labs
prior to the execution of the Agreement.
 

We have included in this proxy statement the August 2017 WholeCo Projections to give our shareholders access to certain
nonpublic information that was provided to prospective buyers. In addition, we have included the December 2017 Projections to give
our shareholders access to certain nonpublic information that was available to the Company Board at the time of the evaluation of the
Merger, the Asset Sale and the Agreement, as well as to Deutsche Bank in connection with the rendering of its opinion dated
December 7, 2017 described above. We have also included the January 2018 Projections to give our shareholders access to certain
nonpublic information that was available to the Company Board prior to the issuance of this proxy statement and to Deutsche Bank in
connection with the rendering of Deutsche Bank’s February 15, 2018 opinion. The Projections are not being included in this proxy
statement to influence any shareholder to vote in favor of approving the Asset Sale or any other proposal. The information in the
Projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other information contained in our
filings with the SEC. In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Projections, shareholders are cautioned not
to place undue reliance on the Projections included in this proxy statement, including in making a decision as to whether to vote in
favor of approving the Asset Sale or any other proposal.
 

The Projections were developed from historical financial statements and a series of assumptions and estimates of our
management. The Projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or compliance with published guidelines of the
SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of
prospective financial information or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Our independent registered public
accounting firm has not examined, compiled, audited or performed any procedures with respect to the Projections nor has it expressed
any opinion or given any form of assurance with respect to such information or their reasonableness, achievability or accuracy, and
accordingly, such independent registered public accounting firm assumes no responsibility for the Projections.

Although presented with numerical specificity, the Projections were developed by our management on the basis of general
business, economic and market conditions as well as factors and consideration specific to our business, all of which involve a high
degree of uncertainty and are difficult to predict, and many of which are beyond our control. These variables, estimates and
assumptions are inherently uncertain, susceptible to multiple interpretations and may prove to have been inaccurate, or may no longer
be accurate. We expect that our future financial results may materially differ from those expressed in the Projections summarized
below due to factors that are beyond management’s ability to control or predict. We cannot guarantee that any of the Projections will
be realized or that our future financial results will not materially vary from the Projections. Other than as described in this section, the
Projections have not been updated since they were prepared, and do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after
the date they were prepared, including the entry into the Agreement, the possible financial impact and other effects of the Asset Sale
on us or subsequent activities or declines in our business levels. The Projections do not take into account the effect of any failure
of the Asset Sale to occur and should not be viewed as accurate or continuing in that context. The Projections should not be construed
as public guidance and will not be provided in the ordinary course of our business in the future. For the foregoing and other reasons,
shareholders and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned that the Projections included in this proxy statement should not be
regarded as a representation or guarantee that the targets will be achieved or have been achieved and that they should not rely on the
Projections.
 

The Projections and estimates included in this proxy statement are forward-looking statements and are qualified in their entirety
by risks and uncertainties that could result in the Projections not being achieved, including, but not limited to, demand for our
products, our reliance on significant customers, our ability to timely develop new products, conditions in the markets for our products,
factors affecting the semiconductor industry, general business and economic conditions, the effects of competition and consolidation in
the industry, and other risks and uncertainties contained in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended January 28, 2017. Neither Sigma nor Silicon Labs, or any of their respective affiliates, advisors, officers,
directors or representatives, has made or makes any representation to any shareholder or other person regarding our ultimate
performance compared to the information contained in the Projections or that the Projections will be achieved. Neither we nor any of
our representatives have made or makes any representation to Silicon Labs, in the Agreement or otherwise, concerning the Projections.
Please refer to the section of this proxy statement captioned “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

Interests of Certain Persons in the Asset Sale
 

In considering the recommendation of the Company Board that our shareholders vote to approve the Asset Sale, shareholders
should be aware that our current and former directors and executive officers have interests in the Asset Sale that are different from, or
in addition to, the interests of our shareholders generally. The members of the Company Board were aware of the different or
additional interests and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the Agreement, and in
recommending to shareholders that the Asset Sale be approved. See “—Recommendation of the Company Board; Reasons for the
Asset Sale” beginning on page 58 of this proxy statement. Shareholders should take these interests into account in deciding whether to
vote “FOR” the Asset Sale Proposal. These interests are described in more detail below, in the section entitled “Interests of Certain
Persons in the Asset Sale and the Liquidation” beginning on page 95 of this proxy statement.

THE ASSET SALE AGREEMENT 
 

The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Agreement. The description in this section and elsewhere
in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Agreement, a copy of which is attached as
Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not
contain all of the information about the Agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read the Agreement carefully and in
its entirety because it is the legal document that governs the Asset Sale.
 
Explanatory Note Regarding the Agreement 
 

The Agreement and this summary of its terms have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the
Agreement. Factual disclosures about the Company contained in this proxy statement or in the Company’s public reports filed with the
SEC may supplement, update or modify the factual disclosures about the Company contained in the Agreement and described in this
summary. The representations, warranties and covenants made in the Agreement by the Company, Silicon Labs and Merger Sub were
qualified and subject to important limitations agreed to by the Company, Silicon Labs and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating
the terms of the Agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement and
described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated with the principal
purposes of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the Agreement may have the right not to close the Asset Sale if the
representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue, due to a change in circumstance or otherwise, and allocating risk
between the parties to the Agreement, rather than establishing matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject
to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to shareholders and reports and documents filed with
the SEC, and in some cases were qualified by disclosures that were made by each party to the other, which disclosures are not
reflected in the Agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties, which do not
purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement, may have changed since the date of the Agreement and subsequent
developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may have been included in this proxy statement.
Shareholders do not have contractual third-party beneficiary rights under the Agreement and should not rely on the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the
Company, Silicon Labs or Merger Sub. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Agreement as actual limitations on the
respective businesses of the Company, Silicon Labs or Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are consented to
by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public.
 
The Asset Sale 
 

Sigma has agreed to sell to Silicon Labs all of the assets which relate to Sigma’s Z-Wave business, including all of the equity
interest in certain of Sigma’s subsidiaries that are primarily engaged in the Z-Wave business, and Silicon Labs will assume all of
Sigma’s liabilities related to the Z-Wave business, for $240 million in cash (the “Consideration”).  The parties had contemplated that
Silicon Labs would acquire Sigma pursuant to a merger if Sigma was able to satisfy certain conditions, including the sale or shut down
of Sigma’s television and set-top box business (the “TV Divestiture”) and the amendment or termination of certain contracts pursuant
to the Agreement.  These conditions were not satisfied and accordingly, the parties are proceeding with the Asset Sale.
 

At the closing of the Asset Sale (the “Asset Sale Closing”), the Company shall deliver to Silicon Labs, in a manner and method
reasonably acceptable to Silicon Labs, (i) all right, title and interest in and to the Purchased Assets free and clear of all Liens (other
than Permitted Liens) and (ii) all other documents and instruments necessary to vest in Silicon Labs right, title and interest in and to
the Purchased Assets free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), and Silicon Labs shall pay to the Company the
Consideration by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account of the Company designated in writing by the Company.
 

The Company has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third party consents necessary to assign the
Contracts related to the Z-Wave business at the Asset Sale Closing. As defined in the Agreement, the Z-Wave business includes the
business of developing, manufacturing, having manufactured, marketing, selling, distributing, servicing, supporting and promoting the
products and services, whether previously released or in development, offered by the Company’s and its subsidiaries Z-Wave business
and/or the Z-Wave Alliance, including without limitation Z-Wave and mesh network ICs, modules, software, certification, and
association membership services.
 

On and after the Asset Sale Closing, upon the reasonable request of Silicon Labs or the Company, the other Party shall prepare,
execute and deliver such other and further agreements, instruments, certificates, and other documents, and take, do and perform such
other and further actions, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the purposes and intent of the
Agreement and to consummate the Asset Sale.

Representations and Warranties 
 

The Agreement contains representations and warranties that the Company, on the one hand, and Silicon Labs and Merger Sub, on
the other hand, have made to one another as of specific dates. These representations and warranties have been made for the benefit of
the other parties to the Agreement and may be intended not as statements of fact but rather as a way of allocating the risk to one of the
parties if those statements prove to be incorrect. In addition, the assertions embodied in the representations and warranties are
qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules provided by the Company to Silicon Labs and Merger Sub and by Silicon
Labs and Merger Sub to the Company in connection with the signing of the Agreement. While the Company does not believe that
these disclosure schedules contain information required to be publicly disclosed under the applicable securities laws other than
information that has already been so disclosed, the disclosure schedules do contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates
exceptions to our representations and warranties set forth in the Agreement. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations
and warranties as current characterizations of factual information about the Company, Silicon Labs or Merger Sub since they were
made as of specific dates, may be intended merely as a risk allocation mechanism between us, Silicon Labs and Merger Sub and are
modified in important part by the confidential disclosure schedules.

Some of the Company’s or Silicon Labs’ and Merger Sub’s representations and warranties are qualified by a material adverse
effect standard. Subject to certain exclusions, a material adverse effect means any event, change or effect that had a material adverse
effect on the financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities, business or results of operations of such party and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole; provided, however, that an event, change or effect will not be deemed a material adverse effect, if such event, change or
effect results from:
 
 ● conditions generally affecting the other companies in such party’s industry;
 

 
● any event, change or effect caused by the announcement, pendency or performance of the Agreement, including any

cancellation of or delays in customer orders, failure to obtain new customer orders, disruption in supplier, partnership,
distributor, reseller or similar relationships, or loss of employees;

 ● changes in trading volume or a decline in such party’s stock price;
 

 

● any actions taken or failure to take action, in each case, which is required by the terms of the Agreement or which Silicon
Labs, with respect to the Company, or the Company, with respect to Silicon Labs, has approved, consented to or requested, or
the failure to take or avoid any such action as a result of any failure to so approve, consent or request, in each case in writing
and in compliance with the terms of the Agreement;

 
 ● general financial, credit or capital market conditions, including interest rates or exchange rates; or
 
 ● any events, changes or effects resulting from a change in law or GAAP after the date of the execution of the Agreement.
 

With respect to the first, second and fifth bullets above, the conditions or circumstances that caused such event, change or effect
do not have an impact on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that is materially disproportionate to the impact such
conditions or circumstances have on the other companies in the Company’s industry.

Conduct of Business Pending the Closing of the Asset Sale
 

The Company has agreed that, subject to certain exceptions in the Agreement and the disclosure schedule delivered by the
Company in connection with the Agreement, between the date of the Agreement and the earlier of the termination of the Agreement or
the completion of the Asset Sale, unless Silicon Labs gives its prior written consent, the Company and its subsidiaries will use
reasonable best efforts to carry on their businesses in the ordinary course in substantially the same manner as conducted prior to the
date of the Agreement and use reasonable best efforts consistent with past practice and policies to preserve substantially intact their
present business organizations, in all material respect and to use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with past practice to keep
available the services of the Company’s executive officers and directors and use their reasonable best efforts consistent with past
practice to, in all material aspects, preserve their relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, licensors, licensees, and others
having business dealings with them.
 

The Company also agreed to promptly notify Silicon Labs of any material event or occurrence not in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice that would have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

new hires in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices in an aggregate amount not to exceed 100,000
shares of Company Common Stock (provided that such Company RSU awards (a) shall not contain any terms providing for
any acceleration in connection with a change of control (including any double trigger acceleration), and (b) shall contain a
standard four year vesting schedule), or other agreements or commitments of any character obligating it to issue any such
shares or other convertible securities, in each case, other than (i) the issuance of Company Common Stock upon the
settlement of Company Options, Company RSUs or other equity awards outstanding as of the date of the Agreement or
granted thereafter in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, (ii) distributions of Company Common Stock under the

Non-Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals; Change in Recommendation

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790715/000143774918004982/sigm20180316_defm14a.htm 141/323

The Company is subject to customary restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and to
provide information to, and enter into discussions or negotiations with, third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals.
However, prior to the shareholder approval of the Asset Sale, the solicitation restrictions are subject to a customary “fiduciary-out”
provision that allows Sigma, under certain circumstances, to provide information to and participate in negotiations or discussions with
third parties with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal if it determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary
duties under applicable law.

Prior to the Company’s shareholder approval of the Asset Sale, the Company Board may, after satisfying certain notice
requirements to Silicon Labs, change its recommendation with respect to the Asset Sale, and Sigma can terminate the Agreement (and
pay the $11.5 million termination fee to Silicon Labs) in order to enter into a superior proposal, if the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so under certain circumstances specified in the
Agreement would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law. Prior to
taking these actions, the Company must provide Silicon Labs with a five business day period in which to negotiate with the Company,
and will negotiate with Silicon Labs in good faith, in order to amend the terms of the proposed transaction such that the acquisition
proposal no longer constitutes a superior proposal.
 

In addition, prior to the Company’s shareholder approval of the Asset Sale, the Company Board may change its recommendation
with respect to the Asset Sale for a reason unrelated to an acquisition proposal if it determines in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel) that, in light of the occurrence of certain intervening events, the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the Company Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law, provided that the Company Board gives Silicon Labs a five business day
period in which to negotiate with the Company so as to avoid such recommendation change.
 

The term “Acquisition Proposal” as used in this proxy statement means any proposal or offer from any Person or “group” (as such
term is defined in the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) (other than Silicon Labs and its Affiliates, including
Merger Sub) concerning any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the Asset Sale) involving: (a) any direct or indirect
sale, lease, exchange, transfer, acquisition or disposal of any assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including any voting equity
interests of subsidiaries, but excluding sales of assets in the ordinary course of business) that constitute or account for (i) 15% or more
of the fair market value of the Company’s consolidated assets, or (ii) 15% or more of the consolidated net sales of the Company or
consolidated net earnings of the Company, (b) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, issuance of
securities, direct or indirect acquisition of securities, recapitalization, tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction in which such
Person or group of Persons directly or indirectly acquires, or if consummated in accordance with its terms would acquire, beneficial
ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities representing more than 15% or
more of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company, or (c) liquidation or dissolution of the Company. An
Acquisition Proposal shall not include any proposal or offer related solely to the sale of the Company’s Wired Connectivity Business
or related solely to the sale of the TV Business.
 

The term “superior proposal” as used in this proxy statement means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result
from an intentional or material breach of the “no solicitations” obligations of the Company pursuant to the Agreement, that if
consummated would result in a Person or group (or the shareholder of any Person) owning, directly or indirectly, (i) more than 85% of
the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock or (ii) more than 85% of the assets of the Company and the Company’s
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in either case, which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor): (a) to be reasonably likely to be consummated on the terms proposed if accepted; and (b) if consummated, would result in a
transaction more favorable to the Company's shareholders from a financial point of view than the Asset Sale, in each case, taking into
account at the time of determination all relevant circumstances, including the various legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
proposal, all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement, any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by
Parent in response to such Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, the anticipated timing,
conditions, approvals and the ability of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal to consummate the transactions contemplated by
such Acquisition Proposal, and that if such Acquisition Proposal is to be financed, such financing is, at the time of the making of such
Acquisition Proposal, fully committed.
 
Shareholder Meeting; Preparation of the Proxy Statement 
 

The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause a meeting of its shareholders to be duly called and held as promptly as
practicable. The Company will not, adjourn or postpone the shareholder meeting; provided, that the Company may adjourn or
postpone the shareholder meeting (A) if as of the time for which the shareholder meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient
shares represented to constitute a quorum or to represent sufficient votes required to obtain the shareholder approval, (B) if the
Company is required to postpone or adjourn by an applicable law, order or request from the SEC or its staff or (C) the Company Board
has determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or adjourn
the meeting of shareholders to give the shareholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has
sent to the shareholders of the Company. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the Company, through the Company Board, will
include the Company Board’s recommendation of the Asset Sale in the proxy statement.

The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement in preliminary form
relating to the shareholder meeting to approve the Asset Sale within 20 business days of the date of the Agreement, (ii) respond as
promptly as practicable to and resolve all comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the proxy statement and all other
proxy materials and promptly notify Silicon Labs upon the receipt of any such comments and (iii) cause the proxy statement to be
mailed to its shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms it has no further comments on the proxy
statement. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the Company Board will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the shareholder
approval for the Asset Sale.
 
Other Covenants 
 

Access to Information; Confidentiality
 

Except as would be reasonably likely to jeopardize the protection of attorney-client privilege or contravene any law, the Company
will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, provide Silicon Labs and Silicon Labs’ representatives reasonable access, at reasonable times
during normal operating hours, to the officers, employees, accountants, properties, offices and other facilities and to all books, records,
contracts and other assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, and the Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, furnish
promptly to Silicon Labs such other information concerning the business and properties of the Company and its subsidiaries as Silicon
Labs may reasonably request from time to time. Silicon Labs and the Company will comply with, and will cause their respective
representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the confidentiality agreement between the Company and
Silicon Labs.
 

Certain Notices
 

From and after the date of the Agreement until the Effective Time of the Asset Purchase, the Company will promptly notify
Silicon Labs of any event or development that occurs that (a) is of a nature that would have or reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the such party, or (b) would require any amendment or supplement to this
proxy statement.
 

Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings
 

Subject to the terms of the Agreement, the Company and Silicon Labs will use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all
material consents that are or become necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its respective obligations
pursuant to, the Agreement and the transaction documents to which it is a party and will reasonably cooperate with Silicon Labs, in the
case of the Company, and the Company, in the case of Silicon Labs, in promptly seeking to obtain all such consents. The Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to give prompt notice to third parties and obtain consents from third parties as required to
consummate the transaction contemplated by the Agreement.
 

Each party will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary or desirable to cause the conditions to the obligations of the other parties hereunder to be satisfied and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement, including making all necessary filings with any government antitrust entity, and
obtaining all necessary waivers, clearances, consents and approvals from, and taking all steps to avoid any action or proceeding by,
any government antitrust entity.
 

Public Announcements
 

Subject to certain exceptions described in the Agreement, each of Silicon Labs and the Company will cooperate in good faith to
jointly prepare all press releases and public announcements pertaining to the Agreement and the transactions governed by it, and
neither Silicon Labs nor the Company shall issue or otherwise make any public announcement or communication pertaining to the
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby without the prior consent of the other party, except as required by law as
determined after consultation with outside counsel or by the rules and regulations of, or pursuant to any agreement with the relevant
stock exchange or trading system, or for information that has been publicly disclosed prior to such public announcement or
communication.

provisions which will remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall remain liable for any liabilities
or damages caused by such party to the extent such liabilities or damages were the result of fraud or the willful and material breach of
the Agreement by such party.
 
Asset Sale Expenses and Termination Fees 
 

Each party will generally pay its own fees and expenses in connection with the Asset Sale, whether or not the Asset Sale is
completed. However, the Company must pay Silicon Labs a termination fee of $11.5 million where:
 
 ● Silicon Labs terminates the Agreement in connection with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change;
 

 
● Silicon Labs terminates the Agreement after the Company enters into an acquisition agreement or publicly announces its

intention to enter into an acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal;
 

 
● Silicon Labs terminates the Agreement after the Company has materially breached the non-solicitation provisions in the

Agreement;
 
 ● the Company terminates the Agreement in order to enter into an acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal;
 

 

● if (i) after the date of the Agreement, but prior to the termination of the Agreement an alternative acquisition proposal by a
third party is publicly announced or otherwise becomes known (including any knowledge of any intention of any third party
to make such a proposal), (ii) thereafter, the Agreement is terminated because the closing did not occur before June 7, 2018 or
because the requisite shareholder approval was not obtained and (iii) within twelve months following the date of such
termination of the Agreement the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any acquisition of a
majority of the Company’s assets or equity interests which is ultimately consummated, or any such acquisition shall have
been consummated; or

 

 

● if the Agreement is terminated due to a breach of the Company’s representations, warranties or covenants (or because the
closing did not occur before June 7, 2018 or because the requisite shareholder approval was not obtained at a time when
Parent would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement due to a breach of the Company’s representations, warranties or
covenants) and within twelve months following the date of such termination of the Agreement the Company shall have
entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any acquisition of a majority of the Company’s assets or equity interests
which is ultimately consummated, or any such acquisition shall have been consummated.

The Asset Sale Proposal will be approved if the holders of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock of record as of the
close of business on the Record Date vote in favor of the proposal. If you are a shareholder and you abstain from voting or fail to vote,
or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the Asset Sale Proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote cast
“AGAINST” the Asset Sale Proposal.
 

The Company Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the Asset Sale Proposal.

PROPOSAL 2
THE LIQUIDATION PROPOSAL

 
The Liquidation Proposal
 

Pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution (the “Plan of Liquidation”) that is described in this proxy
statement and attached as Annex D, Sigma will dissolve and wind up its affairs in order to maximize shareholder value. We encourage
you to carefully read in its entirety the Plan of Liquidation, which is the principal document governing the Liquidation.
 

Completion of the Liquidation is conditioned on approval of the Plan of Liquidation. Moreover, completing the Liquidation is
conditioned upon approval of the Asset Sale Proposal and the subsequent closing of the Asset Sale.
 
 
THE PLAN OF LIQUIDATION
 

The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Plan of Liquidation. The description in this section and
elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of Plan of Liquidation, a copy of which is
attached as Annex D and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. This summary does not purport to be complete and
may not contain all of the information about the Plan of Liquidation that is important to you. We encourage you to read the Plan of
Liquidation carefully and in its entirety.
 
Reasons for the Plan of Liquidation
 

In considering adopting a Plan of Liquidation, the Company Board considered the terms of the Plan of Liquidation and the
dissolution process under the California law, as well as other available strategic options. As part of the Company Board’s evaluation
process, the Company Board considered the risks and timing of each strategic option available to the Company, and consulted with its
financial advisor, management and the Company’s legal counsel. In approving the Plan of Liquidation, the Company Board considered
a number of factors, including but not limited to, the factors described elsewhere in this proxy statement as well as the following
factors:
 

 

● The viability of the Company’s business model following the sale of the Z-Wave Business in the Asset Sale, which
constitutes a substantial portion of the Company’s revenues, and the costs and time that would be required to alter the
Company’s current business structure following the Asset Sale, and, assuming the completion of the Asset Sale, the Company
would have limited assets with which to generate operating revenue and likely will have retained only those employees
required to wind-up its corporate existence;

 

 

● The determination by the Company Board, after conducting a review of the Company’s financial condition, evaluation of the
Company’s strategic alternatives, prospects for the sale of the Company as a whole or its remaining assets in individual sales,
including the sale of the TV Business, following the Asset Sale, the results of operations and the Company’s future business
prospects, that continuing to operate is not reasonably likely to create greater value for the shareholders than the value that
may be obtained for the shareholders pursuant to the sale of the Company’s remaining assets and the complete liquidation and
dissolution of the Company;

 

 
● That the liquidation and dissolution provides shareholders with an opportunity to potentially monetize their investment in the

Company and allows the Company to distribute the maximum amount of cash to the Company’s shareholders from the sale of
its remaining assets;

 

 
● The current intent of the Company to declare and pay an initial distribution from a portion of the net proceeds of the Asset

Sale, subject to a contingency reserve for remaining costs and liabilities, as soon as practicable following the closing of the
Asset Sale;

 
 ● The potential tax benefits of making distributions to shareholders pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation;
 

 
● The material costs associated with the Company’s operations, including accounting, legal and other expenses in connection

with required filings with the SEC and required to support the day-to-day operations of the Company following the closing of
the Asset Sale;

 
 ● The terms and conditions of the Plan of Liquidation, including the provisions that permit the Company Board to abandon the

Plan of Liquidation prior to the effective time if the Company Board determines that, in light of new proposals presented or

changes in circumstances, the Plan of Liquidation is no longer advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders;

 
86



9/26/2019 ex_101753.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790715/000143774918004982/sigm20180316_defm14a.htm 153/323

 
 

 

● If the circumstances justifying the Plan of Liquidation change, under California law, even if the Company has filed a
Certificate of Election to Wind Up and Dissolve with the Secretary of State of the State of California (the “Certificate of
Election”), it may be revoked after the effective time if the Company Board adopts a resolution recommending revocation
and if the shareholders originally entitled to vote on the Plan of Liquidation approve such revocation at a meeting of
shareholders, provided that no assets have been distributed pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation;

 

 
● The fact that California law requires that the Plan of Liquidation be approved by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority

of all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, which ensures that the Company Board will not be taking action
without the support of a significant portion of the shareholders; and

 

 
● The costs of retaining the personnel necessary to administer and manage the Company’s assets and retained liabilities during

the winding up period.
 

The Company Board also considered certain material risks or potentially adverse factors in making its determination and
recommendation, including, but not limited to, the following:
 

 

● The uncertainty of the timing, nature and amount of any liquidation proceeds and distributions to shareholders, including the
risk that there could be unanticipated delays in selling the Company’s remaining assets, including the TV Business, or that the
need to resolve or otherwise address contingent liabilities and the potential emergence of additional liabilities or contingent
obligations during the dissolution process could significantly delay, reduce or prevent any distributions to the shareholders;

 

 
● That further shareholder approval of sales will not be required after the approval of the Plan of Liquidation and that the

Company Board may authorize transactions thereafter with which the shareholders may not agree, including the sale of the
TV Business;

 

 
● The fact that, under California Law, shareholders are not entitled to appraisal rights for their shares of common stock in

connection with the liquidation or dissolution of the Company;
 

 
● The risk that shareholders may be required to repay some or all of the amounts distributed to them by the Company pursuant

to the Plan of Liquidation if unknown or unanticipated claims arise against the Company during the winding up period;
 

 
● The risk that the directors of the Company may be held personally liable for the unpaid portion of any claims against the

Company if they fail to comply with the statutory procedures for the dissolution of the Company, including the payment of
claims against the Company;

 
 ● Potential changes in applicable laws (including tax laws) and regulations;
 

 
● The risk that the IRS could treat any liquidating distributions as an ordinary dividend and that shareholders would receive less

favorable tax treatment with respect to the distribution than is currently anticipated;
 

 
● The risk that the amounts available for distribution to shareholders may be significantly less than the Company’s estimates

due to unknown or contingent liabilities or increases in the costs and expenses related to settling the Company’s and its
subsidiaries’ liabilities and winding up their respective businesses;

 

 
● The fact that, if the shareholders approve the Plan of Liquidation, they would not be permitted to transfer their shares of

common stock after the Company files a Certificate of Dissolution except by will, intestate succession or operation of law;
 

 

● The possibility of disruption to the Company’s operations following announcement of the proposed Liquidation, and the
resulting effects if these actions are not completed, including the diversion of management and employee attention, potential
employee attrition and the potential effects on the Company’s business and its relationships with its customers, distributors
and suppliers;

 

 
● The risks related to the fact that the Company will not be able to retain certain of its current officers and employees and that,

if necessary, the Company may be unable to attract employees to conduct the winding up process;
 

 

● The interests current and former directors and executive officers in the sale of the Company’s remaining assets, the
liquidation and the dissolution, including the Company’s continuing indemnification obligations to certain directors and
officers during the winding up period and the compensation that will be received by employees conducting the winding up
process;

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790715/000143774918004982/sigm20180316_defm14a.htm 154/323

● That the Liquidation prevents the Company from entering into any future strategic business transaction that could enhance

shareholder value, the potential loss of benefits to shareholders of remaining investors in a publicly traded shell company, and
that a dissolution necessarily has the effect of liquidating each shareholder’s investment in the Company; and

 

 
● The other risks described under “Risk Factors —Risks Related to the Plan of Liquidation” and “Cautionary Statement

Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 20 and page 17, respectively.
 

The members of the Company Board did not quantify or otherwise assign relative significance to any of the factors considered
when making their determination, but instead considered whether the factors as a whole justified recommending the Liquidation
Proposal to shareholders. The foregoing summarizes the material factors and risks considered by the Company Board, but it is in no
way meant to be exhaustive of the discussion and information considered by the Company Board. In view of its many considerations,
the Company Board did not quantify or otherwise assign relative significance to any factor considered. In addition, each member of
the Company Board may have given different significance to each factor.
 

The approval of the Plan of Liquidation will authorize the Company Board to wind up the affairs of the Company, to cease
operating the business for which the Company was organized other than as necessary to fulfill its outstanding contractual obligations
and effect the sale of the Company’s remaining assets, including the TV Business and Mobile IoT Business, and to terminate the
existence of the Company
 
 Business Activities Pending Liquidation
 
          As of February 3, 2018, the Company had total cash of $41 million. Assuming consummation of the Asset Sale, the Company
expects to receive net proceeds of approximately $231.5 million, after taxes and expenses payable by the Company in connection with
the Asset Sale, including fees payable to Deutsche Bank and legal and accounting expenses. Additionally, on February 15, 2018, we
closed the sale of our Wired Connectivity Business for $23.5 million, net of holdback amounts. After taxes, we received gross
proceeds from the sale of the Wired Connectivity Business of approximately $23.4 million. In October 2017, we announced a
restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses related to our TV Business. The Company is currently seeking buyers for its TV
Business, and is in discussions with some parties. Our former President and Chief Executive Officer, Thinh Tran, has submitted a non-
binding offer to acquire the TV Business, the terms of which are preliminary and subject to further negotiation. As of the date of this
proxy statement, the Company has yet to make a determination regarding the disposition of the TV Business. Further, the Company is
evaluating alternatives available to it to consummate a sale of the Mobile IoT Business on terms most beneficial to the Company and
its shareholders. As of the date of this proxy statement, there can be assurance as to the sale, timing of any possible sale, or the
expected value of the sales of either the TV Business or the Mobile IoT Business.
 
Summary of the Plan of Liquidation
 

The Company Board approved the Plan of Liquidation on February 21, 2018. The Liquidation is conditioned on obtaining
approval of the Plan of Liquidation from the holders of a majority of all the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock.
 

In the event that the Asset Sale is approved and consummated, and the Liquidation Proposal is approved by the shareholders, the
Company will file a Certificate of Election with the Secretary of State of the State of California and the Company will commence the
Liquidation. The Company will cease to carry on its business and operations, except to the extent necessary to wind-up the Company.
Sigma’s legal existence will continue to the extent necessary to wind up its affairs until the Plan of Liquidation is completed, and when
the Company has been completely wound up without court proceedings therefor, a Certificate of Dissolution will be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of California. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan of Liquidation,
which is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. We encourage you to
read the Plan of Liquidation in its entirety.
 

Once the Company has filed the Certificate of Election with the Secretary of State of the State of California, subject to approval
by the Company Board, the officers, employees and agents of the Company shall, as promptly as feasible, proceed to (i) collect all
sums due or owing to the Company, (ii) sell and convert into cash and/or other distributable form all the assets and properties of the
Company, and (iii) out of the assets and properties of the Company, pay, satisfy and discharge or make adequate provision for the
payment, satisfaction and discharge of all debts and liabilities of the Company, including all expenses of the sales of assets and of the
dissolution and liquidation provided for by the Plan of Liquidation. The Company shall continue to indemnify and advance expenses
to its officers, directors, employees and agents in accordance with its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and any contractual
arrangements, for actions taken in connection with the Plan of Liquidation and the winding up of the affairs of the Company. The
Company Board, in its sole and absolute discretion, is authorized to obtain and maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and
any other insurance as may be necessary, appropriate or advisable to cover the Company’s obligations.

The Plan of Liquidation authorizes the Company Board to establish and set aside a reasonable amount of cash and/or property to
satisfy claims against the Company and its subsidiaries and other obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Contingency
Reserve”), including (i) tax obligations, (ii) all expenses of the sale of the Company’s property and assets, (iii) the salary, fees and
expenses of members of the Company Board, management and employees, (iv) expenses for the collection and defense of the
Company’s property and assets, (v) professional fees and expenses as described in the Plan of Liquidation, and (vi) all other expenses
related to the dissolution and liquidation of the Company and the winding-up of its affairs. The Company may transfer its assets to a
liquidating trust (the “Liquidating Trust”). If the Company transfers its assets to a Liquidating Trust, shareholders as of the record date
determined for such purpose will receive identical beneficial interests in the Liquidating Trust. The Liquidating Trust would be
managed by one or more trustees designated by the Company Board and would continue the process of paying or providing for
payment of the Company’s liabilities.
 

After the initial distribution, additional liquidating distributions, if any, shall be made from time to time before or after the filing
of the Certificate of Dissolution to the shareholders of record, at the close of business on the Effective Date or such other date as may
be determined by the Company Board in its sole discretion, pro rata to shareholders of the Company’s common stock in accordance
with the respective number of shares then held of record; provided that in the opinion of the Company Board adequate provision has
been made for the payment, satisfaction and discharge of all known, unascertained or contingent debts, obligations and liabilities of
the Company (including costs and expenses incurred and anticipated to be incurred in connection with the sale and distribution of
assets and liquidation of the Company). Depending on the tax basis for their respective shares of common stock, shareholders may be
required to recognize gain for tax purposes upon receipt of distributions in liquidation and upon the transfer of any funds to a
liquidating trust. See “—Liquidating Distributions.”
 

In connection with the Liquidation, the Company will ultimately terminate its registration under the Exchange Act, cease filing
periodic reports with the SEC, and file a Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of California when
appropriate. Given the expense and resource demands of being a public company, we may decide to “go dark,” or cease filing periodic
reports with the SEC. This will result in a substantial decrease in disclosure by us of our operations and prospects, and a substantial
decrease in the liquidity and value of the Company Common Stock.
 

If the Asset Sale Proposal is not approved or if the Asset Sale is not consummated for any reason, the Company will not
consummate the Liquidation and will continue to operate its remaining business or attempt to find buyers for its assets.
 
Liquidation Actions
 

When the Plan of Liquidation becomes effective, the Company, acting by an officer, employee, or agent, as applicable, will,
among other things:
 

 
● file a Certificate of Election to Wind Up and Dissolve with the Secretary of State of the State of California, if required,

specifying the matters required by applicable law;
 

 
● cease all of the Company’s business activities and withdraw the Company from any jurisdiction in which it is qualified to do

business, except and insofar as necessary, appropriate or desirable for liquidation of its assets and for the winding up of the
Company;

 

 

● negotiate and consummate the sales and conversion of all of the assets and properties of the Company, including all other
tangible assets, intellectual property and other intangible assets, in one or more transactions upon such terms and conditions
as the Company Board, in its absolute discretion, deems expedient and in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders, without any further vote or action by the Company’s shareholders, into cash and/or other distribution form,
including the assumption by the purchaser or purchasers of any or all liabilities of the Company;

 

 

● take all actions required or permitted under the dissolution procedures of the law of the State of California, including but not
limited to Chapters 19 and 20 of the California Corporations Code including the (i) payment or making reasonable provision
to pay all claims and obligations of the Company, including all contingent, conditional or unmatured claims known to the
Company; (ii) making adequate provision as will be reasonably likely to be sufficient for the payment of any claim against
the Company which is the subject of a pending action, suit or proceeding to which the Company is a party; and (iii) making
adequate provision as will be reasonably likely to be sufficient for the payment of any claims that have not been made known
to the Company or that have not arisen but that, based on facts known to the Company, are likely to arise or to become known
to the Company; and

 

 
● file a Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of California, if required, specifying the matters

required by applicable law.



9/26/2019 ex_101753.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790715/000143774918004982/sigm20180316_defm14a.htm 158/323

 
In addition, subject to approval by the Company Board, under the Plan of Liquidation, the officers, employees, and agents of the

Company will, as promptly as feasible, proceed to:
 
 ● collect all sums due or owing to the Company; and
 

 
● out of the assets and properties of the Company, pay, satisfy, and discharge or make adequate provision for the payment,

satisfaction, and discharge of all debts and liabilities of the Company pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation, including all
expenses of the sales of assets and of the dissolution and liquidation provided for by the Plan of Liquidation.

 
Liquidating Distributions
 

As soon as practicable after the closing of the Asset Sale, the Company plans to distribute, in an initial distribution (with potential
subsequent distributions thereafter), a portion of the net proceeds from the Asset Sale, subject to a contingency reserve for remaining
costs and liabilities. Thereafter, the amount and timing of distributions to shareholders will be determined by the Company Board in its
discretion, subject to the provisions of the Plan of Liquidation. Shareholders will not know at the time of voting the amount of
consideration they will receive. In addition, only shareholders of record as of the record date for a distribution as determined by the
Company Board will be entitled to receive that distribution.
 

As of February 3, 2018, the Company had total cash of $40.6 million. Assuming consummation of the Asset Sale, the Company
expects to receive net proceeds of approximately $231.5 million, after taxes and expenses payable by the Company in connection with
the Asset Sale, including fees payable to Deutsche Bank and legal and accounting expenses. In addition, on February 15, 2018, we
closed the sale of our Wired Connectivity Business for $23.5 million, net of holdback amounts. After taxes, we received gross
proceeds from the sale of the Wired Connectivity Business of approximately $23.4 million. We do not believe the divestiture of the
TV Business will result in material cash proceeds to Sigma; however, if we are able to divest this business, we expect that our
operating expenses and liabilities will be reduced significantly, and our revenue following the closing of the Asset Sale and the TV
Divestiture will be reduced to substantially zero. We do not expect the sale of our Mobile IoT Business, if we are successful in
divesting this business, or the shutdown of this business to be material to our operations or assets available for distribution to
shareholders.

Accordingly, on the bases described in this proxy statement, the Company Board anticipates that the amount of the initial
distribution to shareholders following the Asset Sale will be between $230 and $250 million or $5.82 to $6.33 per share based on
39,499,507 shares outstanding as of February 26, 2018. Following the initial distribution, the Company Board anticipates distributing
up to an additional $10 million to shareholders, for aggregate total distributions of $230 to $260 million or $5.82 to $6.58 per share
based on 39,499,507 shares outstanding as of February 26, 2018, although the amount ultimately distributed to shareholders may be
less than anticipated as a result of the assumptions described elsewhere in the proxy statement and unforeseen circumstances. The
actual amount and timing of, and record date for, distributions will be determined by the Company Board, in its sole discretion, and
will depend upon the amounts deemed necessary by the Company Board to pay or provide for all of our liabilities and obligations. If
you are not a shareholder of record as of the record date for a distribution as determined by the Company Board, you will not be
entitled to receive that distribution.
 

Liquidating distributions after the initial distribution, if any, shall be made from time to time before or after the filing of the
Certificate of Dissolution to the shareholders of record at the close of business on the Effective Date or such other date as may be
determined by the Company Board in its sole discretion, pro rata to shareholders of the Company’s common stock in accordance with
the respective number of shares then held of record; provided that in the opinion of the Company Board adequate provision has been
made for the payment, satisfaction and discharge of all known, unascertained or contingent debts, obligations and liabilities of the
Company (including costs and expenses incurred and anticipated to be incurred in connection with the sale and distribution of assets
and liquidation of the Company).  Liquidating distributions shall be made in cash or in kind, including in stock of, or ownership
interests in, subsidiaries of the Company and remaining assets of the Company, if any.  Such distributions may occur in a single
distribution or in a series of distributions, in such amounts and at such time or times as the Company Board in its absolute discretion,
and in accordance with California law, may determine; provided, however, that the Company shall complete the distribution of all its
properties and assets to its shareholders following the filing of its Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of
California (the “Final Distribution”).
 

The following table shows management’s estimate of cash proceeds and outlays, and of our initial distribution to shareholders as
of the date of this proxy statement. The following estimates are not guarantees and they do not reflect the total range of possible
outcomes. The table assumes that we complete the Asset Sale. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Asset Sale” and “Risk
Factors– Risks Related to the Plan of Liquidation” for a discussion of the risk factors related to the Asset Sale, the Plan of Liquidation
and any potential proceeds which we may be able to distribute to shareholders.

 
The ranges in the table below are based on, among other things: (i) our net cash outflows from operations; (ii) our transaction-

related expenses; (iii) our reserves for known claims (other than a recently filed lawsuit); and (iv) our shutdown costs. The foregoing
is our best estimate of the range of values of the initial distribution, but the amount ultimately distributed to our shareholders could be
less than predicted. Following the initial distribution, the Company Board anticipates distributing up to an additional $10 million to
shareholders, for aggregate total distributions of between $230 to $260 million or $5.82 to $6.58 per share, based on 39,499,507 shares
of Company Stock outstanding as of February 26, 2018, although the amount ultimately distributed to shareholders may be less than
anticipated as a result of the assumptions described above and unforeseen circumstances. Factors that may have a negative impact on
the distribution to shareholders include the actual amount of expenses we incur for things such as legal and accounting fees, operating
expenses and expenses relating to the potential sales of our remaining business lines, as well as other liabilities that we may incur.  We
believe that the range value for each of the variables below is reasonable, based on management’s forecasts which are informed by our
historical operating results.  Although we are attempting to divest our remaining business lines, consisting of our TV Business and our
Mobile IoT Business, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to divest either of these businesses.  The below table assumes that we
are not successful in divesting either of these businesses.   Even if we are successful in divesting our TV Business, we do not believe
the divestiture of this business will result in material cash proceeds to the Company.  However, if we are able to divest this business,
we expect that our operating expenses and liabilities will be reduced significantly, and our revenue following the closing of the Asset
Sale and the TV Divestiture will be reduced to substantially zero.  As a result, and depending on the timing of any potential TV
Divestiture, we may be able to distribute up to an additional $10 million to shareholders, which as noted above, would result in
aggregate total distributions of between $230 and $260 million. We do not expect the sale of our Mobile IoT Business, if we are
successful in divesting this business, or the shutdown of this business to be material to our operations or assets available for
distribution to shareholders.

transaction.
(3) Reflects purchase price, net of estimated taxes.
(4) Reflects cash from revenue collections, net of estimated inventory purchases, payroll expense, retention costs and expenses

related to third party service providers. The major variable between the low range and the and high range estimates are the timing
of any divestitures of the Company’s remaining businesses and the lack of visibility and risks of future sales and the ability to
collect on these sales during the dissolution process.

(5) Consists of estimated financial advisor fees, legal expenses, accounting and other miscellaneous expenses. The major variable
between the low range and the high range estimates is additional legal and accounting fees related to the Asset Sale and potential
other divestitures.

(6) Reflects the Company’s estimate of costs related to currently outstanding claims in order to resolve all known claims prior to final

dissolution, except with respect to a lawsuit filed on March 15, 2018 related to the Asset Sale and the Liquidation, as to which we
have not made any estimate for potential costs. The major variable between the low range and the and high range estimates is the
Company’s ability to resolve these matters in a timely fashion and negotiations of settlement amounts related to outstanding
claims.

(7) Includes estimated entity shutdown costs, (including foreign subsidiaries), estimated reserve for resolution of unknown claims,
anticipated legal expenses and other costs associated with the dissolution (such as repatriation costs). The major variable between
the low range and the and high range estimates is the Company’s management’s judgement relating to potential costs and
providing an estimate for unknown claims, which by their nature are unknown.

 

Contingency Reserve
 

Under the Plan of Liquidation, if and to the extent deemed necessary, appropriate or desirable by the Company Board in its
absolute discretion, the Company may establish and set aside a reasonable amount of cash and/or property to satisfy claims against the
Company and its subsidiaries and other obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries (a “Contingency Reserve”), including (i) tax
obligations, (ii) all expenses of the sale of the Company’s property and assets, (iii) the salary, fees and expenses of members of the
Company Board, management and employees, (iv) expenses for the collection and defense of the Company’s property and assets, (v)
professional fees and expenses as described in the Plan of Liquidation, and (vi) all other expenses related to the dissolution and
liquidation of the Company and the winding-up of its affairs. Any unexpended amounts remaining in a Contingency Reserve shall be
distributed to the Company’s shareholders no later than the Final Distribution If the Company plans to establish a contingency reserve,
the Company Board will set an amount it believes is sufficient taking into account all relevant factors at such time.
 
Liquidating Trust
 

The Company Board may, but is not required to, establish a Liquidating Trust (the “Liquidating Trust”) and distribute assets of the
Company to the Liquidating Trust. The Liquidating Trust may be established by agreement with one or more trustees selected by the
Company Board.  If the Liquidating Trust is established by agreement with one or more trustees, the trust agreement establishing and
governing the Liquidating Trust shall be in form and substance determined by the Company Board. The trustees shall in general be
authorized to take charge of the Company’s property, and to sell and convert into cash or other distributable form any and all corporate
non-cash or non-distributable assets and collect the debts and property due and belonging to the Company, with power to prosecute
and defend, in the name of the Company, or otherwise, all such suits as may be necessary or proper for the foregoing purposes, and to
appoint an agent under it and to do all other acts which might be done by the Company that may be necessary, appropriate or advisable
for the final settlement of the unfinished business of the Company.
 
Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
 

The Plan of Liquidation requires the Company to continue to indemnify and advance expenses to its officers, directors,
employees, and agents in accordance with its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and any contractual arrangements for actions taken
in connection with the Plan of Liquidation and the winding up of the affairs of the Company. The Board, in its sole and absolute
discretion, is authorized under the Plan of Liquidation to obtain and maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and any other
insurance as may be necessary, appropriate, or advisable to cover the Company’s obligations.
 
Amendment, Modification or Abandonment
 

If for any reason the Company Board determines that such action would be in the best interests of the Company, it may amend,
modify or abandon the Plan of Liquidation and all actions contemplated thereunder, including the proposed winding up of the
Company, notwithstanding the shareholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation, to the extent permitted by California law; provided,
however, that the Company Board may not abandon the Plan of Liquidation following the filing of the Certificate of Election without
first obtaining the approval of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding common stock at a special meeting or
annual meeting of the shareholders called for such purpose by the Company Board. Upon the abandonment of the Plan of Liquidation,
the Plan of Liquidation will be void.
 
Complete Liquidation
 

It is intended that the Plan of Liquidation shall be a plan of complete liquidation of the Company in accordance with the terms of
Sections 331 and 336 of the Code.  The Plan shall be deemed to authorize the taking of such action as, in the opinion of counsel to the

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790715/000143774918004982/sigm20180316_defm14a.htm 162/323

Company, may be necessary to conform with the provisions of those Sections 331 and 336 and the regulations promulgated
thereunder.
 
Officers and Directors Following the Liquidation Date
 

After the effective date of the Plan of Liquidation, the Company Board and the officers of the Company shall continue in their
positions, as necessary, for the purpose of winding up the affairs of the Company as contemplated by California law.  The Company
Board may appoint officers, hire employees and retain independent contractors and advisors in connection with the winding up
process, and is authorized to pay to the Company’s officers, directors and employees, or any of them, compensation or additional
compensation above their regular compensation, in money or other property, in recognition of the extraordinary efforts they, or any of
them, shall be required to undertake, or actually undertake, in connection with the successful implementation of the Plan of
Liquidation. Adoption of the Plan of Liquidation shall constitute the approval by the Company’s shareholders of the Company Board’s
authorization of the payment of any such compensation.
 
Dissolution Completion Date
 

The Company has not yet determined an expected completion date of the Liquidation, if any. The Plan of Liquidation, however,
requires that the Company complete the distribution of all its properties and assets to its shareholders following the filing of its
Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of California.
 
Interests of Certain Persons in the Liquidation
 

The cash compensation payable to our director, Mr. Awsare, is subject to certain accelerated vesting rights in the event that the
Liquidation occurs during his first year of service on the Company Board. Additionally, our Compensation Committee is currently
reviewing executive officer retention and incentive compensation related to the Liquidation but has not approved any such
compensation as of the date of this proxy statement. Finally, by approving the Plan of Liquidation, shareholders are approving the
authorization of the Company Board to pay our officers, directors and employees compensation or additional compensation in
connection with the successful implementation of the Plan of Liquidation.

Vote Required and Company Board Recommendation
 

The Liquidation Proposal will be approved if the holders of a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock of record as of
the close of business on the Record Date vote in favor of the proposal. If you are a shareholder and you abstain from voting or fail to
vote, or fail to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote on the Liquidation Proposal, it will have the same effect as a
vote cast “AGAINST” the Liquidation Proposal.
 

The Company Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the Liquidation Proposal.

PROPOSAL 3
THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL

 
The Adjournment Proposal
 

If at the special meeting of shareholders, the Company Board determines it is necessary or appropriate to adjourn the special
meeting, we intend to move to vote on the Adjournment Proposal. For example, the Company Board may make such a determination
if the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented and voting in favor of the Asset Sale Proposal at the special meeting
is insufficient to adopt the Asset Sale Proposal, or if the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented and voting in favor
of the Liquidation Proposal at the special meeting is insufficient to adopt the Liquidation Proposal. If the Company Board determines
that it is necessary or appropriate, we will ask our shareholders to vote only upon (i) the Adjournment Proposal and not the other
proposals, or (ii) the Asset Sale Proposal, the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal but not the
Liquidation Proposal if the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented and voting in favor of the Asset Sale Proposal
is sufficient to adopt the Asset Sale Proposal but the number of shares of Company Common Stock represented and voting in favor of
the Liquidation Proposal is insufficient to adopt the Liquidation Proposal.
 

In this proposal, we are asking you to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Company Board to vote in favor of the
Adjournment Proposal. If the shareholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn the special meeting and any
adjourned session of the special meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies
from shareholders that have previously voted against the Asset Sale Proposal or the Liquidation Proposal. Among other things,
approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes
against the Asset Sale Proposal or the Liquidation Proposal to defeat the respective proposals, we could adjourn the special meeting
without a vote on the Asset Sale Proposal and the Liquidation Proposal and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change
their votes to votes in favor of the Asset Sale Proposal and the Liquidation Proposal. Additionally we may seek to adjourn the special
meeting if a quorum is not present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the special meeting.
 
Vote Required and Company Board Recommendation
 

The Adjournment Proposal will be approved if a majority of the shares of Company Common Stock, present in person or
represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter, vote in favor of the proposal, whether or not a quorum is present.
 

The Company Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

PROPOSAL 4
THE GOLDEN PARACHUTE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL

 
Advisory Vote Regarding the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal
 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c) of the Exchange Act,
we are seeking non-binding, advisory shareholder approval of the compensation that will or may become payable to our named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise related to the Asset Sale or the Plan of Liquidation, as disclosed in the section entitled
“Interests of Certain Persons in the Asset Sale and the Liquidation—Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 98 of this
proxy statement. The proposal gives shareholders the opportunity to express their views on the Golden Parachute Compensation of our
named executive officers. Accordingly, we are requesting shareholders to approve the following resolution, on a non-binding, advisory
basis:  
 

“RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Sigma Designs, Inc. approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain
compensation that will or may become payable to Sigma’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise related to
the Asset Sale or the Plan of Liquidation, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in “Interests of Certain
Persons in the Asset Sale and the Liquidation—Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 98 of the proxy
statement for the special meeting.”

 
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon Sigma, the Company Board, the Company Board’s compensation

committee, or Silicon Labs. Shareholder approval of the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal is not a condition of the
consummation of the Asset Sale or the Plan of Liquidation. Further, certain of the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual
in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to shareholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if
the Asset Sale is consummated, our named executive officers may become eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Asset Sale in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments as described in “Interests
of Certain Persons in the Asset Sale and the Liquidation—Golden Parachute Compensation.”
 

The advisory vote on this non-binding Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the
Asset Sale Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote “FOR” the Asset Sale Proposal and vote “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” for the
Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal (and vice versa).
 
Vote Required and Company Board Recommendation
 

The Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal will be approved on a non-binding, advisory basis if that number of shares of
Company Common Stock representing at least a majority of the quorum requirement, present in person or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote on the subject matter, vote in favor of the proposal.
 
The Company Board recommends that you vote “FOR” the non-binding, advisory Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal.

INTERESTS OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN THE ASSET SALE AND THE LIQUIDATION
 

In considering the recommendation of the Company Board that our shareholders vote to approve the Asset Sale and the
Liquidation, shareholders should be aware that our current and former directors and executive officers have interests in the Asset Sale
and the Liquidation that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our shareholders generally. The members of the Company
Board were aware of the different or additional interests and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and
negotiating the Agreement, and in recommending to shareholders that the Asset Sale and the Liquidation be approved. See “Proposal
1 – The Asset Sale Proposal – The Asset Sale —Recommendation of the Company Board; Reasons for the Asset Sale” and “Proposal
2 – The Liquidation Proposal – Interests of Certain Persons in the Liquidation” beginning on pages 58 and 91 of this proxy statement.
Shareholders should take these interests into account in deciding whether to vote “FOR” the Asset Sale Proposal and the Liquidation
Proposal. These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified in the narrative and the tables below.
The Compensation Committee is reviewing executive officer retention and incentive compensation related to the Liquidation but has
not approved any such compensation as of the date of this proxy statement. Finally, by approving the Plan of Liquidation, shareholders
are approving the authorization of the Company Board to pay our officers, directors and employees compensation or additional
compensation in connection with the successful implementation of the Plan of Liquidation.
 

The names and positions of our executive officers (each of whom is also a named executive officer of the Company) as of the date
of this proxy statement are:
 
 ● Elias Nader, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and Director; and
 
 ● Sal Cobar, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.
 

Our non-employee directors as of the date of this proxy statement are:
 
 ● Saleel Awsare;
   
 ● J. Michael Dodson; and
 
 ● Martin Manniche
 

On January 26, 2018, Thinh Q. Tran, who was our President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors,
resigned as an employee and as a director, and Mr. Nader, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, was appointed
interim President and Chief Executive Officer, in addition to serving as our Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Tran is considered a named
executive officer for purposes of the compensation-related disclosures included in this proxy statement.
 

On February 25, 2018, Messrs. Awsare and Nader were appointed to serve as members of the Company Board. Messrs. Awsare
and Nader will serve until the Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders or until a successor for each is duly elected and
qualified. Further, Mr. Awsare was also appointed to serve on the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Corporate
Governance and Nominating Committee of the Company Board.
 

Mr. Awsare currently serves, and has served since July 2017, as vice president and general manager of the audio and imaging
business of Synaptics, Incorporated, a developer of human interface solutions. Prior to July 2017, Mr. Awsare served in various roles
as an officer of Conexant Systems, LLC, a fabless semiconductor company that was acquired by Synaptics in July 2017. From March
2012 to May 2016, Mr. Awsare was a vice president of Conexant Systems, LLC, and from May 2016 to July 2017, Mr. Awsare served
as president of Conexant Systems, LLC. Before joining Conexant, Mr. Awsare served as president of Nuvoton Technology
Corporation’s U.S. operations and general manager of the company’s audio and voice divisions. In 2008, Mr. Awsare started the audio
product line within Nuvoton, a spin-off of Winbond Electronics. Prior to his time at Nuvoton, Mr. Awsare was the executive vice
president and general manager of mixed signal products for Winbond Electronics Corporation America. Before joining Winbond, Mr.
Awsare was director of engineering for Information Storage Devices, Inc. Mr. Awsare holds a B.S. from Stevens Institute of
Technology and an M.S. from Santa Clara University.
 

Treatment of Equity Awards
 

The Asset Sale will not cause any change to the terms and conditions of the Company Options or Company RSUs. All equity
awards will remain awards with respect to Company Common Stock and will generally remain subject to their existing terms and
conditions. Silicon Labs will not purchase, continue, substitute or assume any Company Options, Company RSUs or other Company
equity awards. However, the Asset Sale will trigger vesting acceleration benefits for our executive officers and directors pursuant to

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/790715/000143774918004982/sigm20180316_defm14a.htm 167/323

the existing terms and conditions of their Company Options and Company RSUs, as is further explained below under the headings “—
Officer Executive Severance Agreements” and “—Annual Director RSU Awards”.

The Liquidation will result in termination of any outstanding Company Options and Company RSUs that have not yet been
exercised or settled. Any shares of Company Common Stock resulting from exercise of Company Options or settlement of Company
RSUs will participate in the relevant distributions on the same terms as all other outstanding shares of Company Common Stock as is
further explained in the section entitled “Proposal 2 – The Liquidation Proposal —The Plan of Liquidation” beginning on page 86 of
this proxy statement.
 

Officer Executive Severance Agreements
 

Each of Messrs. Nader and Cobar is a party to an individual Executive Severance Agreement and Mr. Tran was previously party
to an individual Executive Severance Agreement that was superseded by a separation agreement as is discussed below (collectively,
the “Executive Severance Agreements”). The Executive Severance Agreements provide for certain separation benefits in the event that
the executive experiences an “involuntary termination” (as defined in the applicable Executive Severance Agreement), which is
defined to mean an involuntary termination by Sigma (or a successor entity) without “cause” (as defined in the applicable Executive
Severance Agreement) or a voluntary resignation by the executive under certain circumstances. Each of Messrs. Nader and Cobar are
expected to be subject to an involuntary termination upon completion of the Asset Sale, because Silicon Labs will not be assuming
these agreements.
 

Under each of the executive officer’s Executive Severance Agreement, if the executive officer’s involuntary termination occurs
prior to, or more than 18 months after a following a “change of control” (as defined in the applicable Executive Severance
Agreement), then the executive officer is entitled to:
 

 
● a cash payment equal to the product of one times the sum of (i) the executive officer’s annual base salary plus (ii) the

executive officer’s annual bonus target, all payable by the Company in a lump sum within 60 days following the termination
date;

 

 
● reimbursement of COBRA premium payments made by the executive to maintain his group health plan benefits for a fixed

period after the date of termination (six months for Mr. Cobar and 12 months for Messrs. Nader and Tran); and
 

 
● accelerated vesting of the executive’s outstanding equity awards with respect to that number of shares that would have

otherwise vested based on continued service during the 12 month period following the date of termination.
 

Each of the Executive Severance Agreements defines “change of control” to include “closing of a sale by the Company of all or
substantially all of the Company’s assets.” The Asset Sale will be a sale of “substantially all of the Company’s assets” and, therefore,
will be a change of control for this purpose. Under each of the executive officer’s Executive Severance Agreement, if the executive
officer’s involuntary termination occurs on the date of a “change of control” (as defined in the applicable Executive Severance
Agreement), such as the Asset Sale, or within 18 months after the date of a “change of control”, then the executive is entitled to all
severance benefits described in the bullets above in addition to the following enhancements:
 

 
● the cash payment to Mr. Tran is increased to equal to the product of two (rather than one) times the sum of (i) Mr. Tran’s

annual base salary plus (ii) the annual bonus target, all payable by the Company in a lump sum within 60 days following the
termination date;

 

 
● the lump sum payment to Mr. Tran for COBRA premiums is increased to equal the amount that would be paid by Mr. Tran to

maintain his medical and dental benefits for 24 months (rather than 12 months) after the date of termination; and
 

 
● for each of Messrs. Cobar, Nader and Tran, accelerated vesting in 100% of the executive’s outstanding equity awards (rather

than 12 months accelerated vesting).
 

The foregoing payments and benefits are subject to the executive’s execution of a release of claims against Sigma and its affiliates
and successors. The Executive Severance Agreements also provide that in the event any payment or benefit made in connection with a
change in control of Sigma (the “Change in Control Payments”) would be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the
Code, such Change in Control Payments will be either (i) reduced or (ii) provided in full, whichever results in the executive officer
receiving the greater amount after taking into consideration the payment of all taxes, including the excise tax under Section 4999 of
the Code. None of the executive officers is entitled to any tax “gross up” in respect of excise taxes, if any, that might be assessed under
4999 of the Code in respect of the Change in Control Payments.

On January 26, 2018, Mr. Tran and the Company entered into a Separation Agreement (the “Tran Separation Agreement”)
addressing Mr. Tran’s cessation of employment at the Company and resignation from the Company Board, each effective as of January
26, 2018. The Tran Separation Agreement provides that, upon the release of claims in the Tran Separation Agreement becoming
irrevocable, Mr. Tran will receive the severance benefits due under his Executive Severance Agreement for an involuntary termination
occurring prior to a change of control. See the paragraphs above for a description of these benefits. The Tran Separation Agreement
further provides that, if a change of control of the Company with Silicon Labs (such as the Asset Sale) occurs no later than July 25,
2018, then Mr. Tran will be entitled to receive the additional benefits provided for in Mr. Tran’s Executive Severance Agreement for
an involuntary termination occurring on, or within 18 months after, a change of control. See the paragraphs above for a description of
these additional benefits.
 

For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above under each of the Executive Severance Agreements and
the Tran Separation Agreement that would be payable by the Company to our named executive officers in connection with the closing
of the Asset Sale, see the section entitled “—Golden Parachute Compensation” below.
 

Annual Director RSU Awards
 

In accordance with the Company’s non-employee director compensation program, each of our non-employee directors (other than
Mr. Awsare) received an award of that number of Company RSUs equal to $100,000 divided by the fair market value of the
Company’s Common Stock on the grant date, which was the date of our annual shareholder meeting for 2017 (the “Outside Director
Equity Awards”). The Outside Director Equity Awards vest over one year of service by the director, but accelerate in full upon a
“change of control” occurring during the director’s service on the Company Board. The applicable RSU award agreements define
“change of control” to include “the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to a third party who is not an affiliate of
the Company” as well as a “dissolution of the Company”. The Asset Sale will be a sale of “substantially all of the assets of the
Company” and, therefore, will be a change of control for this purpose. The Liquidation will involve a “dissolution of the Company”
and, therefore, would independently be a change of control for this purpose. However, the Asset Sale must inherently precede the
Liquidation and the subsequent occurrence of the Liquidation will not result in any additional benefits to the non-employee directors.
The value of the non-employee directors’ Company RSUs that are eligible to vest upon the occurrence of the Asset Sale (all such
awards listed in the table under the heading “—Treatment of Equity Awards”) is estimated to be $94,145 for each of Messrs. Dodson
and Manniche, based on an assumed per share price of Company Common Stock of $5.79, which was the average closing price per
share over the five business days following the first public announcement of the Asset Sale.
 

Annual Director Compensation
 

In connection with the appointment to his Company Board on February 25, 2018, the Company agreed to pay Mr. Awsare annual
cash compensation in lieu of equity compensation, of $200,000, paid in quarterly installments. Payment of the annual amount will
accelerate in full if the Liquidation occurs within Mr. Awsare’s first year of service on the Company Board.
 

Indemnification of Directors and Officers
 

Our articles of incorporation eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages and authorizes the indemnification of
directors, officers and employees to the fullest extent permitted by California law. Subject to certain requirements, our bylaws provide
that our directors, officers employees and other persons described in Section 317(a) of the California Corporations Code, including
persons formerly occupying any such position, will be indemnified and further provide for the advancement to them of expenses
incurred in connection with proceedings and claims arising out of their status as such to the fullest extent permitted by California law.
We believe that these limitation of liability and indemnification provisions are useful to attract and retain qualified directors and
officers.
 

The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage shareholders
from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the
likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us
and our shareholders. In addition, your investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage
awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions.
 

In addition, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers. We believe
the indemnification agreements assist us in attracting and retaining qualified individuals to serve as directors and officers of our
Company. The indemnification agreements state that we will indemnify an officer or director to the maximum extent permitted under
California law, including third party actions and derivative actions, and prohibit us from terminating our indemnification obligations as
to the acts of any officer or director occurring before his or her termination.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), may be
permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised
that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore,
unenforceable.
 

Potential Employment Agreements Following the Asset Sale
 

The Agreement does not impose any requirements on Silicon Labs regarding retention or compensation of Company employees
such as our executive officers. At this time, it is expected that none of Messrs. Nader, Cobar and Tran will enter into any employment,
consulting or compensation agreements with the Company or Silicon Labs between the date of this proxy statement and the closing of
the Asset Sale.

Golden Parachute Compensation
 

In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of our
named executive officers may receive that is based on or otherwise related to the Asset Sale, assuming that the Asset Sale was
consummated and each named executive officer (with the exception of Mr. Tran) experienced an involuntary termination (as defined
in the applicable Executive Severance Agreement) on February 28, 2018, the latest practicable date before the date of this proxy
statement. Mr. Tran’s employment ended on January 26, 2018 and he is eligible for certain benefits pursuant to the Tran Separation
Agreement. The Tran Separation Agreement provides that, if a change of control of the Company involving Silicon Labs (including
the Asset Sale but excluding the Liquidation) occurs no later than July 25, 2018, then Mr. Tran will be entitled to receive the additional
benefits set forth below in the table. The amounts below are determined using a per share price of Company Common Stock of $5.79,
which was the average closing price per share over the five business days following the first public announcement of the Asset Sale,
and do not reflect any reduction for tax withholdings. As a result of the foregoing assumptions, the actual amounts, if any, to be
received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set forth below.
 

None of our named executive officers are entitled to receive any additional compensation in connection with the Liquidation. Our
Compensation Committee is currently reviewing incentive compensation arrangements related to the Liquidation, but no decisions
have been made as of the date of this proxy statement. Finally, by approving the Plan of Liquidation, shareholders are approving the
authorization of the Company Board to pay our officers, directors and employees compensation or additional compensation in
connection with the successful implementation of the Plan of Liquidation. In addition, the bonus component of cash severance below
assumes bonuses at the target level for fiscal year 2018. Bonus levels for fiscal year 2019 have not been determined as of the date of
this proxy statement.

(1)     Amount represents the cash severance that each named executive officer is eligible to receive under his Executive
Severance Agreement. With the exception of Mr. Tran, the cash severance identified in this table would be payable in a lump
sum upon a “double-trigger” qualifying termination, as described above under the heading “—Officer Executive Severance
Agreements,” on or within the 18 months following the closing date of the Asset Sale. In such an event, each named
executive officer would be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the product of one times the sum of (i) the named
executive officer’s annual base salary and (ii) the named executive officer’s target annual bonus target. Pursuant to the Tran
Separation Agreement, Mr. Tran is already eligible to receive 12 months of his annual base salary plus his annual bonus
target. The table above sets forth the additional 12 months of annual base salary plus annual bonus target he is eligible to
receive upon the closing of the Asset Sale.

(2)     Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the applicable Executive Severance Agreement, Mr. Cobar and Mr. Nader
would be entitled to certain full accelerated vesting of outstanding Company RSUs and Company Options upon a “double

during the 18 months following the closing of the Asset Sale. Pursuant to the Tran Separation Agreement, Mr. Tran’s
outstanding equity awards have already accelerated in vesting with respect to that number of shares that would have
otherwise vested based on continued service during the 12 month period following his departure date. The table below sets
forth the value of his remaining unvested Company Options and Company RSUs that would be subject to 100% acceleration

of vesting upon the closing of the Asset Sale.The value of the unvested and accelerated Company Options is the positive
difference between the value of $5.79 per share and the exercise price of the Company Option, multiplied by the number of
unvested Company Options as of February 28, 2018, and the value of the unvested and accelerated Company RSUs is equal
to $5.79 multiplied by the number of unvested Company RSUs as of February 28, 2018, in each case, consistent with the

(3)     Under Messrs. Cobar’s and Nader’s individual Executive Severance Agreement, upon a “double trigger” qualifying
termination on or during the 18 months following the closing date of the Asset Sale, each is entitled to reimbursement of
COBRA payments made by the executive to maintain his group health plan benefits for six months in the case of Mr. Cobar
and 12 months in the case of Mr. Nader following the date of termination. Pursuant to the Tran Separation Agreement, Mr.
Tran is eligible to receive reimbursement of COBRA premiums for 12 months. The table above sets forth the additional 12
months of COBRA premium reimbursements Mr. Tran is eligible for upon the closing of the Asset Sale. In addition, under
their Executive Severance Agreements, Messrs. Nader, Cobar and Tran are entitled to be paid out for their accrued and

DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS
 

Dissenters’ rights are a statutory remedy available in many states to shareholders who object to certain extraordinary actions taken
by a corporation, such as mergers or certain other change of control transactions. This remedy typically allows dissenting shareholders
to require the corporation to buy their stock at a price equal to its fair value immediately before the extraordinary corporate action is
taken. Under California law, our shareholders are not entitled to dissenters’ rights in connection with the Asset Sale or the Liquidation.

 
 

LITIGATION RELATING TO THE ASSET SALE AND THE LIQUIDATION
 

On March 15, 2018, a complaint captioned Ann Noys v. Sigma Designs, Inc., et al., Case No. 18-cv-01645-WHO was filed in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of California naming as defendants Sigma, certain members of the Company
Board and Silicon Labs. This action purports to be a class action brought by a shareholder alleging, among other things, that the
defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 14a-9 by filing a materially
incomplete and misleading preliminary proxy statement on February 23, 2018.  The complaint seeks, among other things, either to
enjoin the proposed transactions or to rescind the transactions or award rescissory damages in the event the transactions are
consummated. A preliminary injunction could delay or jeopardize the completion of the transactions, an adverse judgment granting
permanent injunctive relief could indefinitely enjoin completion of the transactions, and an award of rescissory damages could reduce
the amount of cash available for distribution to shareholders in any liquidation that Sigma might undertake following the Asset Sale.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES
 

The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Asset Sale and of any subsequent
asset sales, distributions on Company Common Stock and liquidation of the Company pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation. This
discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial and
administrative rulings, all as in effect as of the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or varying
interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such changes could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth
herein. No ruling has been requested from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) in connection with the Asset Sale, any other
transactions contemplated by the Plan of Liquidation, or distributions on the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Plan of
Liquidation. Accordingly, the discussion below neither binds the IRS nor precludes it from adopting a contrary position. No opinion of
counsel has been or will be rendered with respect to the tax consequences of the Asset Sale, such other transactions or such
distributions.
 

This discussion assumes that holders of Company Common Stock hold their shares as capital assets within the meaning of Section
1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income
taxation that may be relevant to a holder of Company Common Stock in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, nor does it
discuss the special considerations applicable to holders of Company Common Stock subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal
income tax laws, such as, for example, financial institutions or broker-dealers, mutual funds, partnerships or other pass-through
entities and their partners or members, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, personal holding
companies, regulated investment companies, dealers in securities or foreign currencies, traders in securities who elect mark-to-market
method of accounting, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, U.S. expatriates, holders who hold
Company Common Stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction, and holders whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar. This discussion does not address the impact of the Medicare contribution tax or any aspect of foreign,
state, local, alternative minimum, estate, gift or other tax law that may be applicable to a holder. In addition, this discussion does not
address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of Company Common Stock who acquired their shares through stock
option or stock purchase plan programs or in other compensatory arrangements.
 

We intend this discussion to provide only a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of
Company Common Stock of the Asset Sale and of any subsequent asset sales, distributions on Company Common Stock and
liquidation of the Company pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation. We do not intend it to be a complete analysis or description of all
potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of those transactions or distributions.
 

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Company Common Stock, the tax
treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain
determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax
purposes that hold Company Common Stock and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S.
federal income tax consequences to them of the Asset Sale and any distributions on the Company Common Stock.
 

All shareholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them (including the
application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws) of the receipt of any distributions on the
Company Common Stock, including the consequences of recently enacted U.S. federal income tax legislation informally
referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
 

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Company Common Stock that, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, is or is treated as any of the following:
 
 ● an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 

 
● a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under

the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 
 ● an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or
 

 
● a trust if (i) it is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control

all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

 
A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner (other than a partnership or any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S.

federal income tax purposes) of Company Common Stock that is not a U.S. holder.

Tax Consequences to the Company
 

If consummated, the Asset Sale will be a taxable transaction to the Company. Because of the tax attributes of the Company, it is
anticipated that the Company will utilize such tax attributes to reduce substantially the amount of U.S. federal income tax from the
Asset Sale, even taking into account limitations, if any, on the Company’s use of tax attributes in recently enacted U.S. federal income
tax legislation informally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Any subsequent asset sales will also be taxable transactions to the
Company, but the Company does not expect to have tax attributes remaining after the Asset Sale to reduce the amount of U.S. federal
income tax from any such subsequent sales. The determination of whether and to what extent the Company’s tax attributes will be
available, however, is highly complex and is based in part upon facts that will not be known until the completion of the Asset Sale.
Neither the Asset Sale nor any subsequent asset sales will be taxable to holders of Company Common Stock, although as discussed
below, any distribution made by the Company on Company Common Stock will be a taxable event to the holders of Company
Common Stock.
 
Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders
 

Neither the Asset Sale nor any subsequent asset sales will be taxable to U.S. holders of Company Common Stock. If the Company
consummates the Plan of Liquidation and liquidates, a U.S. holder will recognize gain or loss with respect to distributions made on
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation (“Liquidating Distributions”) equal to the difference between (i) the sum
of the amount of money and the fair market value of property (other than money) distributed to such U.S. holder, and (ii) such U.S.
holder’s tax basis in the Company Common Stock.  A U.S. holder’s tax basis generally will equal the U.S. holder’s cost for the
Company Common Stock. Any gain or loss so recognized generally would be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held
the Company Common Stock for more than one year. Long-term capital gain of non-corporate U.S. holders generally is taxed at
preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.  The tax basis of any property other than cash distributed
to a U.S. holder pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation will be the fair market value of the property at the time of the distribution.
 

If the Company liquidates pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation, U.S. holders may receive one or more Liquidating Distributions,
including a deemed distribution of cash or other property.  A U.S. holder’s gain or loss will be computed on a “per share” basis so that
gain or loss is calculated separately for blocks of Company Common Stock acquired at different dates and different prices. Each
Liquidating Distribution will be allocated proportionately to each share of Company Common Stock owned by a U.S. holder.  Gain
will be recognized in connection with a Liquidating Distribution only to the extent that the aggregate value of all Liquidating
Distributions received by a U.S. holder with respect to a share exceeds the U.S. holder’s tax basis for that share. If the amount of the
Liquidating Distributions is less than the U.S. holder’s basis in the Company Common Stock, the U.S. holder will generally recognize
a loss in the year the final Liquidating Distribution is received.
 

If the Plan of Liquidation is not approved (or if it is approved, but one or more distributions are made to U.S. holders that are not
characterized as a distribution in complete liquidation of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes), the discussion above
does not apply to such distributions by the Company to U.S. holders. Rather, such distributions, if any, will be treated as dividends to
the extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles) and will be
includible in income by the U.S. holder. If a distribution exceeds the Company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, the
excess will be first treated as a tax-free return of the U.S. holder’s investment, up to the U.S. holder’s tax basis in Company Common
Stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as a capital gain. Dividends received by a corporate U.S. holder may qualify for a
dividends-received deduction. Dividends received by certain non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are generally taxed at
the lower applicable long-term capital gains rates, provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied.
 

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
 

Information reporting requirements generally will apply to payments of Liquidating Distributions, dividends on Company
Common Stock, if any, and the proceeds of a sale of Company Common Stock paid to a U.S. holder unless the U.S. holder is an
exempt recipient and, if requested, certifies as to that status. Backup withholding generally will apply to those payments if the U.S.
holder fails to provide an appropriate certification with its correct taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status. Any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Tax Consequences of a Liquidating Trust
 

If the Company transfers assets to a liquidating trust in connection with the Liquidation, it intends to structure the liquidating trust
(including making interests in the trust non-transferable) so that it will not be treated as an association taxable as a corporation based
upon the anticipated activities of the liquidating trust. Accordingly, it is expected that the liquidating trust itself should not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax. Holders of Company Common Stock will be treated for tax purposes as having received a distribution at
the time of transfer of their pro rata share of money and the fair market value of property (other than money) transferred to the
liquidating trust, reduced by the amount of known liabilities assumed by the liquidating trust or to which the property transferred is
subject, and then having contributed such property to the trust. The distribution (assuming it is made pursuant to the Plan of
Liquidation) will be treated as a distribution in liquidation of the holders’ Company Common Stock.  See “–Tax Consequences to U.S.
Holders” above, and “–Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders” below.
 

As owners of the trust, the holders of Company Common Stock will be required to take into account for U.S. federal income tax
purposes their pro rata portion of any income, expense, gain or loss recognized by the liquidating trust.  The income, expense, gain or
loss recognized by the liquidating trust will not affect a holder’s basis in Company Common Stock. As a result of the transfer of
property by the Company to a liquidating trust and the ongoing activities of that trust, holders of Company Common Stock should be
aware that they may be subject to U.S. federal income tax even though they do not receive any actual distributions from the liquidating
trust.
 

If a liquidating trust is established, the Company will not obtain any IRS ruling as to the tax status of that trust and there is no
assurance that the IRS would agree with the Company’s conclusion that the liquidating trust should be treated as a liquidating trust for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. If, contrary to the Company’s expectation, it were determined that the liquidating trust should be
classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as an association taxable as a corporation, income and losses of the liquidating trust
would be reflected on its own tax return rather than being passed through to the holders of Company Common Stock and the
liquidating trust would be required to pay federal income taxes at corporate tax rates. Furthermore, much of the above discussion
would no longer be accurate.  For instance, all or a portion of any distribution made to the holders of Company Common Stock from
the liquidating trust could be treated as a dividend. Holders of Company Common Stock might also be subject to liability for state and
local taxes on account of their interests in a liquidating trust. State and local tax laws may differ in various respects from U.S. federal
income tax law.
 
Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders
 

Neither the Asset Sale nor any subsequent asset sales will be taxable to non-U.S. holders of Company Common Stock. If the
Company liquidates pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation, a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
any gain realized upon receipt of Liquidating Distributions unless (i) the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s
conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the non-U.S. holder
maintains a permanent establishment in the United States to which such gain is attributable), or (ii) the non-U.S. holder is a
nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition and certain
other requirements are met.
 

Gain described in (i) above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated
rates in the same manner as if the non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder. A non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a
branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on its effectively connected earnings
and profits that are attributable to such gain, as adjusted for certain items. Gain described in (ii) above generally will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax at a rate of 30%, which may be offset by U.S.-source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the
individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax
returns with respect to such losses.
 

If the Plan of Liquidation is not approved (or if it is approved, but one or more distributions are made to U.S. holders that are not
characterized as a distribution in complete liquidation of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes), the discussion above
does not apply to such distributions by the Company to non-U.S. holders. Rather, such distributions, if any, will be treated as
dividends to the extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax
principles). Any dividends on Company Common Stock paid to a non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at
a 30% rate, subject to reduction under an applicable treaty. In order to obtain a reduced rate of withholding, a non-U.S. holder will be
required to provide a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, (or in either case suitable
successor form) certifying its entitlement to benefits under a treaty. A non-U.S. holder who is subject to withholding tax under such
circumstances should consult its tax advisor as to whether it can obtain a refund for all or a portion of the withholding tax.

If a non-U.S. holder of Company Common Stock is engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and if dividends on
Company Common Stock are effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business (and, if certain tax treaties apply, the
non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment within the United States and such dividends are attributable to such permanent
establishment), the non-U.S. holder, although exempt from U.S. withholding tax, will generally be taxed in the same manner as a U.S.
holder (see “–Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders” above), except that the non-U.S. holder will be required to comply with certain
certification requirements in order to claim an exemption from withholding tax. These non-U.S. holders should consult their tax
advisors with respect to other tax consequences of the ownership of Company Common Stock, including the possible imposition of a
branch profits tax at 30% (or at a reduced rate under an applicable tax treaty) for corporate non-U.S. holders.
 

Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
 

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder (commonly referred to as “FATCA”), impose a
30% withholding tax on payments of dividends on Company Common Stock and, for dispositions after December 31, 2018, payments
of gross proceeds from the sale, exchange, redemption, or other disposition of Company Common Stock to “foreign financial
institutions” (as defined under FATCA) as the beneficial owner or an intermediary, and certain other non-U.S. entities unless various
U.S. information reporting and due diligence requirements (generally relating to ownership by U.S. persons of interests in or accounts
with those entities) have been satisfied or an exemption applies. An intergovernmental agreement between the jurisdiction of a
recipient and the United States may modify the rules described in this paragraph. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the
effect, if any, of the FATCA rules for you based on your particular circumstances.
 

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
 

Generally, the amount of Liquidating Distributions and dividends, if any, paid on Company Common Stock to non-U.S. holders
and the amount of tax, if any, withheld with respect to those payments must be reported annually to the IRS and to the non-U.S.
holders. Copies of the information returns reporting such Liquidating Distributions and dividends and withholding may also be made
available to the tax authorities in a country in which the non-U.S. holder resides under the provisions of an applicable income tax
treaty. In general, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to backup withholding with respect to payments of Liquidating Distributions or
dividends on Company Common Stock, provided a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, (or
applicable successor form), has been provided by the non-U.S. holder or the non-U.S. holder otherwise establishes an exemption. In
addition, a non-U.S. holder will be subject to information reporting and, depending on the circumstances, backup withholding with
respect to payments of the proceeds of the sale of Company Common Stock conducted within the United States or through certain
U.S.-related financial intermediaries, unless the statement described above has been received, or the non-U.S. holder otherwise
establishes an exemption. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a
non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.
 

THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX DISCUSSION SET FORTH ABOVE IS INCLUDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION
PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES
RELEVANT TO COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS. THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE ASSET SALE OR ANY
DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE COMPANY COMMON STOCK MAY VARY DEPENDING UPON THE PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH SHAREHOLDER. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR CONCERNING THE
FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN OR OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE ASSET SALE OR ANY
DISTRIBUTIONS ON COMPANY COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF RECENTLY ENACTED U.S.
FEDERAL INCOME TAX LEGISLATION INFORMALLY REFERRED TO AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
 
 
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information
 
The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information has been derived from the historical financial
statements of Sigma Designs, Inc. (the “Company”), adjusted to give effect to the Asset Sale and the Wired Connectivity Sale (as
defined below). On February 15, 2018, the Company along with its direct wholly-owned subsidiary, Sigma Designs Technology
Singapore Pte. Ltd., a company organized under the laws of Singapore (“Seller”), completed the previously announced sale (the
“Wired Connectivity Sale”) of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Sigma Designs Israel S.D.I Ltd., a company organized under
the laws of Israel and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller (“Sigma Israel”), pursuant to the terms of that certain Share Purchase
Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated February 6, 2018, with Integrated Silicon Solution (Cayman), Inc., a company
organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands (“Buyer”). Sigma Israel conducts the Company’s Media Connectivity business,
consisting primarily of the Company’s HomePNA and G.hn product lines. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Seller sold to Buyer
all of the issued and outstanding shares of Sigma Israel for $28,000,000, payable in cash, and adjusted for Sigma Israel’s cash and debt
at closing and other adjustments for fluctuations in working capital. The consideration paid at closing and received by the Company
was $23,464,101. This amount included a deduction of $335,599 in purchase price adjustments for fluctuations in working capital, and
excluded $4,200,000 which is being held in escrow subject to customary adjustments after closing. The unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended October 28, 2017, and for the fiscal years ended January
28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, have been prepared with the assumption that the Asset Sale and the Wired Connectivity Sale occurred
as of February 1, 2015. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of October 28, 2017, has been prepared with
the assumption that the Asset Sale and the Wired Connectivity Sale were completed as of the balance sheet date.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared based upon assumptions deemed
appropriate by management. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements and pro forma adjustments are
based upon information available as of the date of this proxy statement and have been presented solely for informational purposes and
are not necessarily indicative of the condensed consolidated balance sheet or statements of operations that would have been realized
had the Asset Sale or the Wired Connectivity Sale occurred as of the dates indicated, nor is it meant to be indicative of any future
consolidated financial position or future results of operations.
 
Historical condensed consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial information to give effect to pro forma events that are (1) directly attributable to the Asset Sale and the Wired
Connectivity Sale, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with respect to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of
operations, are expected to have a continuing impact on financial results following the Asset Sale and the Wired Connectivity Sale.
Accordingly, the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations do not include realized gains
from the Asset Sale or the Wired Connectivity Sale. The adjustments presented are based on currently available information and
reflect certain estimates and assumptions. Therefore, actual results may differ from the pro forma adjustments.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are based on the Company’s historical consolidated financial
statements and should be read in conjunction with the (i) audited financial statements for the Company for the fiscal years ended
January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement and the remaining sections of
this proxy statement; (ii) unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the Company as of and for the nine months ended
October 28, 2017, which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement and the remaining sections of this proxy statement,
and (iii) the unaudited carve-out financial statements for the Z-Wave Business, the assets of which are the subject of the proposed
Asset Sale, included below in this proxy statement.

SIGMA DESIGNS, INC.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 
1. Basis of Presentation

 
The Company’s historical consolidated financial statements have been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
financial information to present events that are (i) directly attributable to the Z-Wave Business and Sigma Israel, (ii) factually
supportable and (iii) are expected to have a continuing impact on the Company’s consolidated results following the Z-Wave
Business disposition and the pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations do not reflect an estimated gain or loss on
the sale of the Z-Wave Business.
 

2. Pro Forma Adjustments
 
The following pro forma adjustments are included in the Company’s unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
information:
 

 (A)Represents the estimated sale proceeds
  (B)Represents the estimated tax liability on the gain recognized on the sale of the Z-Wave Business
  (C)Represents net adjustments to accumulated deficit which are comprised of the sales proceeds net of the estimated tax expense.
  (D)Represents elimination of intercompany investment  
  (E)Represents adjustments to give effect to the disposal of the Z-Wave Business.
  (F)These adjustments reflect the elimination of revenue and expenses associated with Sigma Israel, including corporate support

resources assigned to the business unit.
  (G)These adjustments reflect the disposition of Sigma Israel as if the transaction occurred on October 28, 2017, which was sold

for $28.0 million in cash and adjusted for Sigma Israel’s cash and debt at closing and other adjustments for fluctuations in
working capital of approximately $0.3 million, less estimated transaction costs. Transaction costs are estimated to be
approximately $0.4 million. Approximately $4.2 million of cash will be held in escrow for a period of time following the
closing as a source of recovery for indemnification claims by the Buyer. Retained earnings reflect the estimated after-tax gain
from the transaction. Income taxes were determined to be negligible and not included as part of the pro form adjustments.

Z-WAVE BUSINESS
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 
1. Organization and summary of significant accounting policies
 
Description of the Transaction: On December 7, 2017, Silicon Laboratories Inc. (“Silicon Labs”) and Sigma Designs, Inc. (referred
to in these unaudited carve-out financial statements as the “Company” or “Sigma”) announced a definitive agreement under which
Silicon Labs was to acquire the Company in a cash transaction valued at approximately $282 million, subject to certain closing
conditions. On January 23, 2018, the Company announced that due to the closing conditions in the previously announced definitive
agreement not being satisfied, the parties will move forward with the sale to Silicon Labs of all of the assets which relate to the
Company’s Z-Wave business, including all of the Company’s equity interest in certain subsidiaries engaged in the Z-Wave business,
and the assumption by Silicon Labs of all of the Company’s liabilities related to the Z-Wave business for $240 million, conditional
upon the approval by the Company’s shareholders. The transaction will be treated as an asset sale of the collective assets comprising
the Z-Wave business.
 
Basis of presentation:  The financial statements presented are stand-alone financial statements for the Company’s Z-Wave business
(“Z-Wave”). They are presented for purposes of attaining shareholder approval of the above-described transaction with Silicon Labs.
 
Z-Wave has historically operated as a part of the Company and not as a standalone company. Financial statements representing the
historical operations of Z-Wave have been derived from the Company’s historical accounting records and are presented on a carve-out
basis. All revenues and costs as well as assets and liabilities directly associated with the business activity of Z-Wave are included in
the financial statements. The financial statements also include allocation of certain general, administrative, sales and marketing
expenses and costs of sales from the Company. However, amounts recognized by Z-Wave are not necessarily representative of the
amounts that would have been reflected in the financial statements had Z-Wave operated independently of the Company.
 
As part of the Company, Z-Wave is dependent upon the Company for all of its working capital and financing requirements as the
Company uses a centralized approach to cash management and financing of its operations. Financial transaction relating to Z-Wave
are accounted for through the Net Parent Investment account.   Accordingly, none of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents or debt at
the corporate level have been assigned to Z-Wave in the financial statements. Net Parent Investment represents the Company’s interest
in the recorded net assets of Z-Wave on the accompanying condensed balance sheet. All significant transactions between Z-Wave and
the Company have been included in the accompanying carve-out financial statements.
 
All significant intercompany accounts and transactions between the businesses comprising Z-Wave have been eliminated in the
accompanying carve-out financial statements. The Company operates and reports quarterly financial results that consist of 13 weeks
and end on the last Saturday of the period and annual financial results that end similarly on a 52-53 week basis. The third quarter of
fiscal 2018 ended on October 28, 2017 (91 days). The years ended January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016 were 52-week years.
Accordingly, Z-Wave is presented with the same ending periods.
 
The unaudited carve-out financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“US GAAP”) for interim financial information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”).  They do not include all disclosures required by US GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for
the years ended January 28, 2017, and January 30, 2016, as filed with the SEC.
 
The carve-out financial statements included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments
that, in management’s opinion, are necessary to present fairly the financial position at October 28, 2017, January 28, 2017 and January
30, 2016, the results of operations for the nine months ended October 28, 2017 and for the years ended January 28, 2017 and January
30, 2016.  These results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods or for Z-Wave as a
standalone operating entity.
  
There are no significant differences in critical accounting policies applied by Z-Wave during any of the periods presented, as
compared to the critical accounting policies described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 28,
2017. For a complete summary of significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1, “Organization and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies,” in Part II, Item 8 of the Company’s fiscal 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Organization and nature of operations:  Z-Wave is a business operation of the Company. It is a provider of intelligent platforms for
use in a variety of home entertainment and home control appliances. Z-Wave sells products into two primary target markets which are
the Connected Smart TV Platforms and Internet of Things (“IoT”) Devices markets. The integrated system-on-chip (“SoC”) solutions
serve as the foundation for some of the world’s leading consumer products, including televisions, media connectivity, smart home, and
mobile IoT products. A majority of Z-Wave’s products are semiconductors that are targeted toward end-product manufacturers,
Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”), and Original Design Manufacturers (“ODMs”), however, a certain amount of non-
recurring engineering services, development kit sales, and licensing revenue are also derived from Z-Wave’s target markets.
 
Use of estimates in the preparation of carve-out financial statements:  The preparation of the carve-out financial statements
requires estimates to be made and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  The
primary areas that require significant estimates and judgments by management include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition,
allowances for doubtful accounts, sales returns, warranty obligations, inventory valuation, stock-based compensation expense,
purchased intangible asset valuations, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, tax contingencies,
litigation and other loss contingencies. The estimates and related judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on
historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results
could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to these carve-out financial statements. 
 
Fair value of financial instruments: Certain financial assets and liabilities are measured and disclosed at fair value, defined as the
exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and
minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to
measure fair value: 
 
Level
1 –

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level
2 –

Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that
are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
term of the assets or liabilities.

Level
3 –

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or
liabilities.

 
For certain assets and liabilities, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities, the carrying amounts
approximate their fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these items.
 
In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value. No fair value election has been made for any eligible financial instruments.
 
Inventory:  Inventory consists of wafers and other purchased materials, work in process and finished goods and is stated at the lower
of standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis, or market value.  Ending inventory is evaluated for
excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis.  This evaluation includes analysis of historical and estimated future unit sales
by product as well as product purchase commitments that are not cancelable. Demand forecasts are developed based, in part, on
discussions with customers about their forecasted supply needs.  However, customers generally only provide firm purchase
commitments for the month and quarter and not an entire forecasted period.  Additionally, sales and marketing personnel provide
estimates of future sales to prospective customers based on actual and expected design wins. A provision is recorded for inventory in
excess of estimated future demand.

Obsolete inventory is written off. Obsolescence is determined from several factors, including competitiveness of product offerings,
market conditions and product life cycles.  Provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of revenue.  At the time of
the loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not
result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.  If this lower-cost inventory is subsequently sold, the higher
gross margins for those products is realized.
 
Inventory write-downs inherently involve assumptions and judgments as to amount of future sales and selling prices. There can be no
assurances that future events and changing market conditions will not result in significant inventory write-downs. 
 
Warranty: Products typically carry a one-year limited warranty that products will be free from defects in materials and
workmanship.  Warranty cost is estimated at the time revenue is recognized, based on historical activity and additionally for any
specific known product warranty issues. Accrued warranty cost includes hardware repair and/or replacement and software support
costs and is included in accrued liabilities in the carve-out balance sheets. Although extensive product quality programs and processes
are performed, the warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates, product recalls, repair or
replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure. Should actual costs differ from initial
estimates, the difference is recorded in the period they are identified. Actual claims are charged against the warranty reserve.

 
Software, equipment and leasehold improvements:  Software, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost.  
Depreciation and amortization for software, equipment and leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line method based
on the useful lives of the assets (one to five years) or the remaining lease term if shorter.  Any allowance for leasehold improvements
received from the landlord for improvements to facilities is amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining
lease term or the useful life of the leasehold improvements.  Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

  
Intangible and other long-lived assets:  The amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible and other long-lived assets acquired,
other than goodwill, impact the amount and timing of future amortization.  Intangible assets include those acquired through business
combinations and also intellectual property purchased for incorporation into product designs. Amortization for such intellectual
property begins at the time that shipments of the associated products into which it is incorporated begins.  The intellectual property is
amortized over the estimated useful life of the associated products, generally two to three years.
 
Impairment of other long-lived assets:  Long-lived assets, including purchased intangible assets, are tested for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances, such as a change in technology, indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be
recoverable.  If indicators of impairment exist, the carrying value of an asset or asset group is evaluated for recoverability based on
comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate. If an asset is not recoverable an
impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. The income valuation
approach is primarily to determine the fair value of long-lived assets and purchased intangible assets. 
 
Revenue recognition: Revenue is derived primarily from product sales which comprised approximately 97%, 95% and 96% of total
net revenue during the nine months ended October 28, 2017 and fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Products, referred to as chipsets,
consist of highly integrated chips and embedded software that enables real-time processing to establish a mesh network protocol that
provides an interoperable platform for automation and monitoring solutions, all of which are referred to as embedded software.
Software is not delivered as a separate product in connection with product sales.  Revenue is recognized for product sales when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably
assured. These criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment. Reductions of revenue are recorded for estimated product
returns and pricing adjustments, such as rebates, in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these
reductions is based on historical sales returns, analysis of credit memo data, specific criteria included in the agreements, and other
factors known at the time. The Company accrues 100% of potential returns at the time of sale when there is not sufficient historical
sales data and recognizes revenue when the right of return expires. The Company also accrues 100% of potential rebates at the time of
sale and does not apply a breakage factor. The Company reverses the accrual for unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate
programs contractually end and when it believes unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid. The accrual
for unclaimed rebate amounts is reversed as specific rebate programs contractually end and when unclaimed rebates are no longer
subject to payment and will not be paid.

On occasion, revenue is derived from the license of internally developed intellectual property (“IP”). IP licensing agreements
generally provide licensees the right to incorporate IP components in their products with terms and conditions that vary by licensee.
License fee arrangements generally include multiple deliverables and require a determination as to whether there is more than one unit
of accounting. To the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting, an allocation of the total fee on such
arrangements is made to the individual units of accounting using management’s best estimate of selling price ("ESP"), if third party
evidence ("TPE") or vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") does not exist. Revenue recognition is deferred for consideration
that is contingent upon future performance or other contractual terms.
 
The process for determining ESP for deliverables without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the
unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. The key factors that are considered in developing the ESPs include the
nature and complexity of the licensed technologies, the cost to provide the deliverables, the availability of substitute technologies in
the marketplace and historical pricing practices. Revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting depending on the nature of the
deliverable(s) comprising the unit of accounting in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria mentioned above. Fees under
these agreements generally include (a) license fees relating to IP, (b) engineering services, and (c) support services. Historically, each
of these elements has standalone value and therefore each are treated as separate units of accounting. Any future licensing
arrangements will be analyzed based on the specific facts and circumstances which may be different than historical licensing
arrangements.
 
For deliverables related to licenses of technology that involve significant engineering services, revenue is recognized in accordance
with the provisions of the proportional performance method or milestone method, as applicable. Costs associated with engineering
services are determined using actual labor dollars incurred and estimate other direct or incremental costs allocated based on the
percentage of time the engineer(s) spent on the project. These costs are deferred until revenue recognition criteria have been met, at
which time they are reclassified as cost of revenue. 
 
Licensing revenue deliverables are generally recognized using the milestone method. Under the milestone method, revenue is
recognized that is contingent upon the achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is
achieved. To be considered substantive, the consideration earned by achieving the milestone should be (a) commensurate with either
(i) the vendor’s performance to achieve the milestone or (ii) to the enhancement of the value of the item delivered as a result of a
specific outcome resulting from the vendor’s performance to achieve the milestone (b) the consideration should relate solely to past
performance, and (c) the consideration should be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement. Other
milestones that do not fall under the definition of a milestone under the milestone method are recognized under the authoritative
guidance concerning revenue recognition.
 
A portion of revenues is derived in the form of fees from members of a wholly-owned entity dedicated to the marketing, development
and proliferation of the Z-Wave brand. Membership fees vary based on level and are generally billed on an annual basis with no
obligation to renew. Revenue from membership dues is recognized in the month earned. Membership dues received in advance are
included in deferred revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the appropriate period, which is generally twelve months or less.
The monthly dues are generally structured to cover the administrative costs and membership services. Membership revenue was
approximately $1.4 million, $1.9 million and $1.9 million during nine months ended October 28, 2017 and fiscal 2017 and 2016,
respectively.
 
Revenue is deferred when payments are received from customers in advance of revenue recognition.  Deferred revenue at October 28,
2017, January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016 was $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million, and is included in accrued liabilities in
the accompanying carve-out balance sheets.
  
Cost of revenue: Cost of revenue is comprised of the cost of chipset solutions, which consists of the cost of purchasing finished
silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries, costs associated with purchase of assembly, test and quality assurance services
and packaging materials, as well as royalties paid to vendors for use of their technology. Also included in cost of revenue is the
amortization of purchased IP, manufacturing overhead, including costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing
support, product warranty costs, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, and stock-based compensation expense for personnel
engaged in manufacturing support.

Foreign currency:  The functional currency of foreign transactions is either the U.S. dollar or the local currency of each
country.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the end of
each period, and non-monetary assets, such as inventory, property, plant and equipment, and liabilities are recorded at historical
rates. Gains and losses from these remeasurements as well as other transaction gains and losses are included in interest and other
income, net, in the carve-out statements of operations. Operations that utilize foreign currency as their functional currency translate
such currency into U.S. dollars using (i) the exchange rate on the balance sheet dates for assets and liabilities, and (ii) the average
exchange rates prevailing during the period for revenues and expenses.  Any translation adjustments resulting from this process are
shown separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders’ equity. Foreign currency
transaction gains and losses resulted in net losses of approximately $0.4 million, less than $0.1 million and $0.1million during the nine
months ended October 28, 2017 and fiscal 2017and 2016, respectively.
 
Concentration of credit risk:  Financial instruments which are potentially subject of concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of
accounts receivable.  
 
Sales to recurring and new customers are generally made on open account, a prepaid or letter of credit basis. Ongoing credit
evaluations of customers is performed and sales generally do not require collateral for sales on credit.  Accounts receivable balances
are periodically reviewed to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible and any amounts that are determined to be
uncollectible are included in the allowance for doubtful accounts.
 
Stock-based compensation:  Stock incentive plans are effective under which incentive stock options, restricted stock units, restricted
stock awards and non-qualified stock options have been granted to employees. Also offered is an employee stock purchase plan for all
eligible employees. Compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees is recognized based on the closing
fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.  Stock option awards are measured using the Black-Scholes-
Merton option pricing model.  The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense on
a ratable basis over the requisite service period for time-based awards and on a graded basis for performance-based awards in the
carve-out statements of operations.  Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and the statement of
operations is revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Benefit from stock-based
compensation is recognized if an excess tax benefit is realized.
 
Income taxes:  Income taxes are accounted for under an asset and liability approach.  Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects
of any temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
reported for income tax purposes, and any operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards.  Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for
future taxable amounts and deferred tax assets are recognized for future deductions, net of any valuation allowance, to reduce deferred
tax assets to amounts that are considered more likely than not to be realized. 
 
The impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized as the largest amount that is more-likely-
than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority.  An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has
less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. 

  
Research and development costs: Costs incurred in the research and development of products are expensed as incurred.
 
Comprehensive income: Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income.  Other comprehensive
income includes certain changes in equity that are excluded from results of operations; specifically, foreign currency translation
adjustments.

Acquired intangible assets represent intangible assets acquired through business combinations. Purchased IP represents intangible
assets acquired through direct purchases of licensed technology from vendors which is incorporated into products. Purchased IP not
yet deployed relates to purchased IP from third parties for products that are currently in development. Amortization of such IP begins
upon the earlier of the beginning of the term of the license agreement, as appropriate, or at the time shipments of the associated
products into which such IP is incorporated begins.
 
The following table presents the amortization of intangible assets in the accompanying carve-out statements of operations (in

Commitments
 
Purchase commitments
 
Non-cancelable orders to purchase semiconductor products from suppliers are placed on an eight to twelve week lead-time basis.  As
of October 28, 2017, the total amount of outstanding non-cancelable purchase orders was approximately $3.8 million.
 
Third-party licensed technology
 
In October 2015, an agreement with a vendor to purchase $6.1 million of licensed technology for integration into future iterations of
products was entered. Payments under this agreement are on an annual basis from December 2015 through December 2018. As of
October 28, 2017, remaining payments under this agreement totaled $1.1 million.

Design Tools
 
In June 2016, an agreement with a vendor to purchase $2.6 million of design tools was entered. Payments under this agreement are
made on a quarterly basis from August 2016 through May 2019. As of October 28, 2017, remaining payments under this agreement
totaled $1.6 million. In addition to this agreement, other purchase arrangements for certain design tools were made; remaining
payments under these agreements totaled $1.2 million as of October 28, 2017. Payments under these arrangements are to be made
through fiscal 2021. These amounts were fully accrued as of October 28, 2017.
 
Royalties
 
Royalty payments are made for the right to sell certain products under various license agreements. During the nine months ended
October 28, 2017, gross royalty expense of $40 thousand was recorded. None was recorded for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2017
and January 30, 2016. Royalty payments are recorded in cost of revenue in the accompanying carve-out statements of operations.
  
Contingencies
 
Litigation
From time to time, claims and legal proceedings arise in the ordinary course of business. The number and significance of these matters
are expected to increase as business expands. In particular, an increasing number of patent and other intellectual property claims are
expected as the number of products and competitors grows. Any claims or proceedings, whether meritorious or not, could be time
consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant
operational resources or cause the entry into royalty or licensing agreements which, if required, may not be available on favorable
terms. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the financial position and
results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs and, potentially, in future periods.
 
Product warranty
 
In general, products are sold with a one-year limited warranty to be free from defects in material and workmanship.  Warranty cost is
estimated at the time revenue is recognized and is based on historical activity and additionally for any specific known product
warranty issues.  Accrued warranty cost includes hardware repair and/or replacement and is recorded in accrued liabilities in the
accompanying carve-out balance sheets.
 
Details of the change in accrued warranty as of October 28, 2017, January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016 are as follows (in
thousands):

Deductions   (85)   (191)   (191)

Ending balance  $ 133  $ 157  $ 249 
 
Indemnifications
 
In certain limited circumstances, agreements were made to indemnify certain customers against intellectual property infringement
claims from third parties related to the use of owned technology. In these limited circumstances, the terms and conditions of sale or of
standing agreement with such customers generally limit the scope of the available remedies to a variety of industry-standard methods
including, but not limited to, a right to control the defense or settlement of any claim, the right to procure for continued usage, and a
right to replace or modify the infringing products to render them non-infringing. To date, no costs related to any claims under such
indemnification provisions have been incurred.

Third-party licensed technology
 
Technology from various third parties is regularly licensed and incorporated into product offerings. Some of these technology licenses
require a payment of royalties directly to the licensor while others require a reporting of sales activities to licensors to enable royalties
to be collected by them directly from customers. From time to time, audits are conducted by such licensors to assure compliance with
the terms of license agreements.
 
Additional payments or accruals may be required as a result of pending or future compliance audits. For license agreements
incorporating royalty obligations, settlement-related payments made in connection with compliance audits are charged to cost of
revenue. For license agreements incorporating reporting obligations, settlement-related payments are treated as penalties and charged
to operating expenses in sales and marketing. As of the date of this proxy statement, it is management’s opinion that the terms of such
license agreements are substantially under compliance.

 
5.          Equity incentive plans and employee benefits
 
Equity incentive plans
 
Equity incentive plans are available to employees that provide for the grant of stock awards to employees, directors and consultants
and that are designed to encourage and reward long-term contributions while providing an incentive for retention.  These plans are
also intended to align employees’ interest with the creation of long-term shareholder value.  
 
Accounting requirements for such plans are associated with the fiscal year end when matters related to the amount and timing, and the
assumptions for making such judgements, are evaluated for current and future year expense recognition. As of the filing date of the
proxy statement to which this financial statement presentation is included, all such matters were neither fully evaluated nor sufficiently
determined to provide analysis of the Z-Wave business unit in relation to Sigma Designs, Inc. on a retrospective or on-going basis.
Therefore, what follows is a general description of the equity incentive plans of Sigma Designs, Inc. without the allocation which the
proposed transaction requires. Except for the note describing past stock-based compensation expense and its allocation within the
carve-out financial statement of operations, the following discussion regarding equity incentive and other equity-based compensation
plans in this Footnote 5 is for the whole of Sigma Designs, Inc. and does not consider any consequence arising from the separation of
Z-Wave business. Additionally, this discussion is specific only to the fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016.
  
Valuation of stock-based compensation
 
The fair value of RSA and RSU awards is based on the quoted market price of the underlying stock at the date of grant.  The fair value
of stock option and employee stock purchase plan right awards is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option
pricing model.  The determination of fair value of stock option and employee stock purchase plan right awards on the date of grant
using an option-pricing model is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and
subjective variables.  These variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and
actual employee stock option exercise behavior.

The following table sets forth the total stock-based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item in the carve-out
statements of operations for Z-Wave (in thousands):

General and administrative   17   21   16 

Total stock-based compensation  $ 524  $ 653  $ 655 
 
 
401(k) tax deferred savings plan
 
A 401(k) tax deferred savings plan is maintained for the benefit of qualified employees who are based in the United States.  Under the
401(k) tax deferred savings plan, U.S. based employees may elect to reduce their current annual taxable compensation up to the
statutorily prescribed limit, which is $18,000 in calendar year 2017.  Employees age 50 or over may elect to contribute an additional
$6,000. Matching contributions were made to the 401(k) tax deferred savings plan of $0.2 million and $0.5 million for the fiscal years
ended January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively.
 
Retirement pension plans
 
Retirement pension plans are maintained for the benefit of qualified employees in Denmark, Taiwan, The Netherlands, and Germany.
Matching contributions were made under these plans of $0.2 million for each of the three months ended October 28, 2017 and October
29, 2016, and $0.6 million for each of the nine months ended October 28, 2017 and October 29, 2016.
 
Employee termination benefits
 
Termination benefits are payable when an employee is involuntarily terminated, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary
termination in exchange for termination benefits. For the accounting treatment and or timing recognition of involuntarily termination
benefits, the Company distinguishes between one-time termination benefit arrangements and ongoing termination benefit
arrangements. A one-time termination benefit arrangement is established by a termination plan and applies to a specified termination
event. One-time involuntary termination benefits are recognized as a liability when the termination plan meets certain criteria and has
been communicated to employees. If employees are required to render future service in order to receive these one-time termination
benefits, the liability is recognized ratably over the future service period. Termination benefits other than one-time termination benefits
are termination benefits for which the communication criterion is not met but that are committed to by management, or termination
obligations that are not specifically determined in a new and single plan. These termination benefits include all legal, contractual and
past practice termination obligations to be paid to employees in case of involuntary termination. These termination benefits are
accrued for when commitment creates a present obligation to employees for the benefits expected to be paid, when it is probable that
employees will be entitled to the benefits and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
 
6. Income taxes
 
A provision for income taxes of $1.2 million was recorded for the nine months ended October 28, 2017 and $1.2 million and $1.7
million for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016, respectively. Included in the provision for income taxes is
unrecognized tax benefits of $1.4 million for the nine months ended October 28, 2017 and $1.3 million and $0.8 million for the fiscal
years ended January 28, 2017 and January 30, 2016.

AGREEMENT
 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:
 

ARTICLE I

The Merger
 

1.1     The Merger. On the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in
accordance with California Law, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the Company, as
the surviving corporation in the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the “Surviving Corporation”), such that immediately
following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger shall have the effect
provided in this Agreement and as specified in the California Law.
 

1.2     Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will
take place at 10:00 a.m., California time, as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within two Business Days) after satisfaction or, to
the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all such conditions), unless
this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Article IX hereof or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the Parties
hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub, at their sole discretion, shall not be
required to conduct the Closing during the last 14 days of any fiscal quarter of Parent. The Closing shall be held at the offices of DLA
Piper LLP (US), 2000 University Ave, Palo Alto, California, 94303, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the Parties hereto,
and the actual date of the Closing is hereinafter referred to as the “Closing Date.”
 

1.3     Effective Time. On the Closing Date, the Parties shall (a) cause an agreement of merger satisfying the applicable
requirements of the California Law and otherwise in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, but subject to any changes as
may be required by the Secretary of State of the State of California and agreed to by Parent and the Company (the “Agreement of
Merger”) to be duly executed by the Company and Merger Sub and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of California as soon
as practicable on the Closing Date, together with the officer’s certificate required by the California Law, and (b) make any other
filings, recordings or publications required to be made by the Company or Merger Sub under the California Law in connection with
the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Agreement of Merger is duly filed and accepted by the Secretary of
State of the State of California or on such later date and time as shall be agreed to by the Company and Parent and specified in the
Agreement of Merger (such date and time being hereinafter referred to as the “Effective Time”).

1.4     Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the
California Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, all property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving Corporation.
 

1.5     Governing Documents. The Company Articles shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated so as to read in
its entirety in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B and, as so amended and restated, shall be the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Legal Requirement. The Company
Bylaws shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated to conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and as such shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Legal Requirement.
 

1.6     Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The Parties shall take all actions necessary so that (a) the directors
of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, and (b) the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.
 

ARTICLE II

Effect of Merger on Company Securities
 

2.1     Effect on Capital Stock.
 

(a)     Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Parties or holders of any securities of the Parties, subject to Section 2.1(d), each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)
and any Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $7.05 in cash, without interest (the “Merger
Consideration”). From and after the Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Company Shares in accordance with
Section 2.2.

(b)     Cancellation of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, all Company Shares owned by the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub or by any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.
 

(c)     Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock. At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, without par value per share, of Merger Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation.
 

(d)     Adjustment to Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately, without
duplication, to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time so as to provide Parent and the holder of Company Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to permit the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.
 

2.2     Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.
 

(a)     Paying Agent Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the paying agent in connection with the Merger (the “Paying Agent”). The Paying
Agent shall also act as the agent for the Company’s shareholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable to all holders of Company Common Stock (including Company Common Stock to be issued
prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.4) (such cash amount, the “Paying Agent Fund”), in each case, for the sole
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. In the event the Paying Agent Fund shall be insufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Paying Agent
in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
make, and the Paying Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration, out of the Paying Agent Fund in accordance with this
Agreement.

(b)     Procedures for Surrender. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event, within three Business Days
thereafter), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail (and make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Company Shares (the “Certificates”) or non-certificated Company Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry
Shares”) and whose Company Shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Company
Shares pursuant to Section 2.1. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, together
with such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II for each Company Share
formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share. All such amounts shall be mailed (or made available for collection by
hand if so elected by the surrendering holder) within three Business Days following the Paying Agent’s receipt of such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, letter of transmittal and such other documents, and the Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition precedent to payment that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is not payable. Any other transfer or similar
Taxes incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid by Parent. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, without interest
thereon.
 

(c)     Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registrations of transfers of Company Shares on the
records of the Company, other than registrations of transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades
effected prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Legal Requirement. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(d)     Termination of Paying Agent Fund; No Liability. At any time following twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) remaining in the Paying Agent Fund that have not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the
Paying Agent’s routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Legal
Requirements) as general creditors thereof with respect to the applicable Merger Consideration, payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b), without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement.
 

(e)     Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the holder thereof and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such holder of a bond in such amount as
Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to any such Certificates, the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section
2.1 hereof.
 

2.3     Dissenters’ Rights.
 

(a)     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares, if any, as to which the holder
thereof shall have (i) properly demanded that the Company purchase such Company Shares for fair market value in accordance with,
and otherwise complied with, the provisions of Chapter 13 of the California Law (“Chapter 13”) and (ii) not effectively withdrawn or
lost such holder’s rights to demand purchase for such Company Shares for fair market value pursuant to Chapter 13 (each, a
“Dissenting Share”), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1, but
instead at the Effective Time shall become entitled only to payment of the fair value of such Company Shares determined in
accordance with Chapter 13 (it being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto other than the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance with Chapter 13); provided,
however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares under Chapter 13, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder’s Dissenting Shares
shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have become
exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest or duplication, the Merger Consideration.
 

(b)     The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for the purchase of
any Company Shares pursuant to Chapter 13, of any withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served and received
by the Company under Chapter 13, and Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

2.4     Treatment of Company Equity Awards.
 

(a)     All options to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each a “Company Option”), restricted stock unit
awards with respect to Company Common Stock (each a “Company RSU Award”) and other equity awards (collectively, “Company
Equity Awards”) that were granted under the Company’s stock plans, including the Sigma Designs 2015 Stock Incentive Plan
(successor to and continuation of the Sigma Designs 2001 Stock Plan and the Sigma Designs Amended and Restated 2009 Stock
Incentive Plan), the CopperGate Communications Ltd. 2003 Share Option Plan or any other equity plan, agreement or arrangement
other than the Company ESPP (as defined below) (collectively, the “Company Stock Plans”) prior to the Effective Time, which are
outstanding as of the Capitalization Date, are set forth in Section 2.4(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, together with the
holder’s name, the date of grant, the type of award, the number of Company Shares originally granted and number of outstanding
shares subject to the Company Equity Award, the vesting schedule, any expiration date, and any per Company Share exercise price or
purchase price.
 

(b)     Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will assume any Company Option or substitute for a Company
Option any option, unit award, restricted share or other rights to acquire shares of the capital stock of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the vesting of each Company Option then outstanding and held by an employee
or other service provider whose employment or service relationship with the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company has not
terminated shall be accelerated in full. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger without any action on the part of the holder
thereof in consideration for the right to receive a cash payment (the “Company Option Consideration”), if any (without interest and
less applicable withholding Taxes) with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the number of vested shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (including as a result of accelerated vesting), and
(ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, each Company Stock Option that has an
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor. The
Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary thereof shall pay the Company Option Consideration to which a former holder of a Company
Option who is an employee or former employee of the Company or such Subsidiary is entitled and for which Tax withholding is
required through the employee payroll system of the Company or such Subsidiary no later than its next regularly scheduled payroll
date occurring at least five Business Days following the Effective Time. Each such payment of Company Option Consideration to a
former holder of a Company Option for which Tax withholding is not required shall be paid to such holder in cash by the Surviving
Corporation or a Subsidiary thereof.

(c)     Except as provided by Section 2.4(d), neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will assume any Company
RSU Award or substitute for a Company RSU Award any option, unit award, restricted share or other rights to acquire shares of the
capital stock of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Except as provided by Section 2.4(d), at the Effective Time, each Company RSU
Award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled by virtue of the
Merger without any action on the part of the holder thereof in consideration for the right to receive a cash payment (the “Company
RSU Consideration”) with respect thereto (without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock remaining subject to and not previously issued in settlement of such Company RSU
Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration. Payment of the Company RSU Consideration
shall be made in pro rata installments in accordance with the time-based vesting schedule to which the shares of Company Common
Stock remaining subject to such Company RSU Award were subject immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the continued
employment or other service relationship of the former holder of such Company RSU on the applicable post-Effective Time vesting
date (each, an “RSU Vesting Date”); provided that to the extent that any such Company RSU Award constitutes nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Company RSU Consideration payable with respect to such Company RSU
Award shall be paid in accordance with the applicable Company RSU Award’s terms and conditions at the earliest time permitted
under the terms of such award that will not result in the application of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code. The
Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary thereof shall pay the Company RSU Consideration to which a former holder of a Company
RSU Award who is an employee or former employee of the Company or such Subsidiary is entitled and for which Tax withholding is
required through the employee payroll system of the Company or such Subsidiary no later than its next regularly scheduled payroll
date occurring after each applicable RSU Vesting Date. Each such payment of Company RSU Consideration to a former holder of a
Company RSU Award for which Tax withholding is not required shall be paid to such holder in cash by the Surviving Corporation or a
Subsidiary thereof as soon as practicable after each applicable RSU Vesting Date.
 

(d)     At the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, and whose holder remains an employee of the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary thereof
immediately after the Effective Time and is employed in Denmark, Singapore or the United States, shall be cancelled by virtue of the
Merger without any action on the part of the holder thereof in consideration for the right to receive from Parent immediately after the
Effective Time pursuant to Parent’s 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated as of the Effective Time, a restricted stock
unit award issued by Parent for that number of restricted stock units equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock remaining subject to and not previously issued in settlement of such Company RSU Award as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) the RSU Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share). Each such restricted stock unit award
issued by Parent pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be subject to substantially the same vesting schedule as was applicable under
the Company RSU Award cancelled in exchange therefor, including any provision for accelerated vesting.

(e)     As of the Effective Time, all Company Stock Plans will be terminated, and no further Company Options,
Company RSU Awards or other rights with respect to Company Shares will be granted thereunder.
 

(f)     Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if applicable, any committee thereof
administering the Sigma Designs 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the “Company ESPP”)) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other necessary actions to provide that (i) no new Offering or Offering Period (as defined by the Company
ESPP) shall be commenced under the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (ii) participation in the Company ESPP shall
be limited to those employees who are participants on the date of this Agreement; (iii) no participant in the Company ESPP may
increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect under the Company ESPP on the date of this
Agreement; (iv) each Offering Period in effect on the date of this Agreement shall terminate effective upon the earlier of the first
purchase date following the date of this Agreement and the third trading day occurring before the Effective Time, but subsequent to
the exercise of options on such purchase date (in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP and the limitations under the
Company ESPP regarding the maximum number and value of shares of Company Common Stock a participant may purchase in such
Offering Period); and (v) immediately prior to, and subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, the Company ESPP shall
terminate.
 

(g)     The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to effect the provisions set forth
in this Section 2.4, including without limitation any necessary amendments to any Contracts or other instruments and the delivery of
all required notice, as applicable. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall send a notice to all holders of outstanding Company
Equity Awards, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent, which notice shall (i) notify such holders of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) describe the treatment of outstanding Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) seek the
acknowledgement and consent of such holders to the cancellation of outstanding Company Equity Awards as contemplated by this
Agreement. Such notification shall not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit any material statement necessary in order
to make the statements therein not misleading.
 

2.5     Withholding. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares
and from any payments under Section 2.4 such amounts as Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Legal
Requirement. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

ARTICLE III

Representations and Warranties of the Company
 

Except (x) as may be disclosed in the Company Reports filed or furnished with the SEC after January 30, 2016 and prior to
three Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding, in each case, (i) any nonspecific disclosures set forth in any “Risk
Factor”, “Forward Looking Statements” or “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” sections) and (ii) any other
similar disclosures to the extent they are predictive, cautionary, general, nonspecific or forward-looking in nature (it being understood
that (a) any factual information contained within such headings, disclosure or statements shall not be excluded and (b) this clause (x)
shall not be applicable to Sections 3.2 or 3.6(a)), or (y) as may be disclosed in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure schedule delivered to Parent by the Company on the date of this Agreement (the “Company Disclosure Schedule”), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:
 

3.1     Organization, Good Standing and Qualification. The Company is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the Legal Requirements of the State of California. Each of the Company’s Subsidiaries is an independent legal Person
duly organized, validly existing and (where applicable) in good standing under the Legal Requirements of the place of its
establishment or incorporation. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted under the Legal Requirements of
the place of its establishment or incorporation and is qualified to do business and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that
have the concept of good standing) as a foreign corporation or other legal entity under the Legal Requirements of the places where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except, in the case of
any of the foregoing where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
 

3.2     Capital Structure.
 

(a)     As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized share capital of the Company consists of 100,000,000
authorized shares of Company Common Stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value (“Preferred Stock”), of

to do business and in good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity under the Legal Requirements of the places where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except, in the case of
any of the foregoing, where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or Merger Sub.
 

4.2     Corporate Authority and Approval. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has full corporate power and authority and has
taken all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate

violation of, or a default under, any provision (x) of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Parent and (y) the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of Merger Sub, (B) a breach or violation of, assuming (solely with respect to performance of this Agreement
and consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions) that the matters referred to in Section 4.4 are complied with, any Legal
Requirement to which Parent or Merger Sub is subject, (C) a default under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract
to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party, or an acceleration of Parent’s or, if applicable, Merger Sub’s, obligations under any such
Contract or require any Consent under any such Contract, (D) the creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) on any properties

by Parent and Merger Sub of their obligations hereunder and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Transactions, except

Effect on the Parent or Merger Sub.

satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in any
condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of such party
set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of the other party to consummate the Merger, or the remedies available to the
parties hereto.
 

5.5     Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents.
 

(a)     Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all material Consents that are or become necessary for
its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party and will reasonably cooperate with the other Party in promptly seeking to obtain all such Consents, including, but
not limited to any matters involving Government Antitrust Entities.
 

(b)     Each Party shall give promptly such notices to third parties and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain such
third party Consents as are required to consummate the Transactions.
 

(c)     Each Party shall cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to assist any other Party in giving such notices
and obtaining such Consents as are required to consummate the Transactions.
 

(d)     Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, each Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary or desirable to cause the conditions to the obligations of the other parties hereunder to be satisfied and to
consummate the Transactions, including making all necessary filings (including filings under the HSR Act) with any Government
Antitrust Entity, and obtaining all necessary waivers, clearances, Consents and approvals from, and taking all steps to avoid any
Action or proceeding by, any Government Antitrust Entity.

(e)     To the extent required, each Party will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and
file, or cause to be promptly prepared and filed, with the appropriate Government Antitrust Entity not later than ten Business Days
after the date of this Agreement (unless otherwise mutually agreed among the Parties) any notification with respect to the Transactions
that may be required pursuant to the HSR Act in which each requests early termination of the waiting period thereunder. Each Party
shall respond, as promptly as reasonably practicable, to all information requests from a Government Antitrust Entity under the HSR
Act, and shall reasonably cooperate with the other Parties in responding to any such request. Each Party will furnish to the other (or its
outside counsel) such information and assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing; provided, however,
that one Party disclosing information to another may do so on the condition that it be shared only with the receiving Party’s outside
counsel who, in turn, agrees to treat such information as confidential and not disclose it to any third-parties without the advance
written consent of the party who disclosed the information. Each Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
favorably any review or consideration of the antitrust aspects of the Transactions by any Government Antitrust Entity with jurisdiction
over the enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Legal Requirements. Each of the Parties shall promptly inform the other Parties of
any substantive communication to or from the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice (“DOJ”), or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions. Each of the Parties will consult and
cooperate with one another in advance, and will consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
communication, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion, proposal, or other submission made to a
Government Antitrust Entity in connection with any investigation or proceeding conducted under either (i) the HSR Act; or (ii) any
foreign competition statute enforced by any Government Antitrust Entity. Except as may be prohibited by any Government Antitrust
Entity, in connection with any investigation or proceeding under the HSR Act concerning the Transactions, each of the Parties shall
permit Representatives of the other Parties (which may, as appropriate, be limited to outside counsel), to be present and participate in
all meetings, conferences, or other communications with a Government Antitrust Entity relating to any such proceeding or
investigation.
 

(f)     In furtherance and not in limitation of the efforts referred to above in this Section 5.5, if any objections are
asserted with respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act, or if any Action, suit or proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity or any third party challenging the Transactions or that would
otherwise prohibit or materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions, each Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or actions, suits or proceedings so as to permit the consummation of
the Transactions as expeditiously as possible.
 

(g)     Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 5.5, none of Parent or its Affiliates shall be obligated to: (i)
offer, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order, trust or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other
disposition of any material portion of the capital stock, assets, rights, products or businesses of Parent, the Company, or their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates; (ii) agree to any material restrictions on the activities of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company); (iii) waive any material rights; (iv) defend, commence or prosecute any Action; or (v)
take any other action to prevent, effect the dissolution of, vacate, or lift any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining
order, or other order in any suit or proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the consummation of the
Transactions.
 

5.6     No Solicitation.
 

(a)     From and after this Agreement Date, until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article IX, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and it shall direct their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly through another Person, solicit, initiate or knowingly take any action to
facilitate or encourage any Acquisition Proposal or proposal or inquiry that would be reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal or, subject to Section 5.6(b), (i) conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations with, disclose any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or
encourage any effort by, any third party that is seeking to make, or has made, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any agreement
in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other Contract relating to any Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Transactions or breach its obligations under this Agreement,
or (iii) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing, provided however, nothing in this Section 5.6(a) shall prohibit the
Company or its Representatives from contacting in writing any Person or group of Persons who make, following the date of this
Agreement, a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, for the sole purpose of clarifying the terms and conditions thereof so as to
determine whether such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and any
such actions shall not be a breach of this Section 5.6(a). The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall direct its
Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of its or their
Representatives to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, with any third party conducted with respect to

any Acquisition Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such third party (or its agents or advisors) in possession
of non-public information in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company or
its Subsidiaries to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such information.

(b)     Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.6 to the contrary, at any time prior to the Company Shareholder
Approval, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement, and not resulting
from an intentional or material breach of Section 5.6(a), that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside counsel) constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, the Company may,
upon a good faith determination by the Company Board (after consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements: (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and such Person's Representatives); provided,
however, that the Company and such Person enter into a customary confidentiality agreement containing terms no less favorable to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and containing additional provisions that expressly permit the
Company to comply with the terms of this Section 5.6 (a copy of which confidentiality agreement shall be promptly and in any event
with 24 hours provided for informational purposes only to Parent); provided, further, that any material non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries provided or made available to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal shall,
to the extent not previously provided to Merger Sub or Parent, be provided or made available to Merger Sub or Parent as promptly as
reasonably practicable after it is provided to such Person making such Acquisition Proposal; and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

(c)     The Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing, in no event later than 24 hours after receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal and shall indicate the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, of the terms and conditions of
any proposal or offer, the nature of any inquiries or contacts, and all material written materials relating to such Acquisition Proposal
and thereafter shall keep Parent informed of all material developments affecting the status and the material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal.
 

(d)     Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to make, withdraw, amend or modify, or
publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse, adopt or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, (iii) fail to
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iv) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or
exchange offer for the Company Common Stock within six Business Days after the commencement of such offer, (v) fail to issue a
press release reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation after receipt of any publicly announced Acquisition Proposal within
five Business Days following Parent's written request to issue such press release (provided that Parent shall not be entitled to request
such reaffirmation more than one time, unless such Acquisition Proposal is amended, after which, the Company Board shall provide a
reaffirmation for each such amendment in accordance with this Section 5.6(d)), or (vi) resolve or agree to take any of the foregoing
actions (each such foregoing action or failure to act in clauses (i) through (vi) being referred to as a “Company Adverse
Recommendation Change”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the determination (but not the adoption, approval, recommendation or
endorsement) by the Company Board that an Acquisition Proposal is or would be reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal shall
not be deemed a “Company Adverse Recommendation Change”. The Company Board may, at any time prior to the receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval and subject to the Company’s compliance with Section 5.6(e) of this Agreement, take any of the
following actions: (A) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if
the Company Board concludes in good faith (i) after consultation with the Company's financial advisor, that the Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements; or (B) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements.
 

(e)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 5.6(d), the Company shall not be entitled to make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 5.6(d) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.4 in
response to a Superior Proposal unless: (A) the Company shall have first provided prompt prior written notice, and in any event at
least five Business Days prior to making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (the “Notice Period”) to Parent of its
intention to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (a “Recommendation Change Notice”), which notice shall contain a
description of the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, including the most current version of the agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal (which description and summary shall be updated on a prompt basis) in the form to be entered into
and the identity of the third party making the Superior Proposal or, if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is an
Intervening Event, a description of the events, facts and circumstances giving rise to such Intervening Event and the reason for the
Company Adverse Recommendation Change (it being understood and agreed that the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of itself,
be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change); (B) the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisor and
legal counsel to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, or in the case of an Intervening Event, to
cause such Intervening Event to no longer form the basis for the Company Board to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being understood and agreed (x) that in the event that, after
commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in
price, the Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least three Business Days remain in the Notice Period
subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such material revision and (y) that there may be multiple extensions of the
Notice Period); and (C) Parent does not make, within the Notice Period, a binding written proposal that is determined by the Company
Board (after consultation the Company's outside counsel, and in the case of a Superior Proposal, the Company’s financial advisor), to
cause such Intervening Event to no longer form the basis for the Company Board to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or cause the offer previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, as the case may be.

(f)     The Company shall keep confidential any proposals made by Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement,
other than in the event of any amendment to this Agreement or to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements to be
disclosed.
 

(g)     Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board, directly or indirectly
through their respective Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company’s stockholders a position with respect to a
tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any “stop, look
and listen” communication to the Company’s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if the Company Board
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of the directors’ fiduciary duties under any Legal Requirement; provided that, in each case, any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with this Section 5.6; and provided further that any such
statement or disclosure shall constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless such statement or disclosure is
accompanied by an express, unequivocal affirmation of the Company Board Recommendation.
 

(h)     The Company agrees that any action taken by any individual officer, director, financial advisor, banker,
investment banker or, at the direction of the Company, by any other Company Representative that, if taken by the Company, would
constitute an intentional or material breach of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.6 shall be deemed to be an intentional or
material breach (as applicable) of this Section 5.6 by the Company.

5.7     Preparation of the Proxy Statement.
 

(a)     The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare, within 16 Business Days after the date of this
Agreement, in consultation with Parent, and cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form. The Proxy
Statement will include, among other items set forth in Section 5.8(a) below, a proposal of the approval of the Merger (but not the Asset
Purchase). The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare, within 20 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, in
consultation with Parent, and cause to be filed with the SEC in preliminary form a Proxy Statement which will include, among other
items set forth in Section 5.8(a) below, a proposal of the approval of the Asset Purchase (but not the Merger) (such preliminary Proxy
Statement, the “Asset Proxy Statement”, but also a “Proxy Statement”). Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its shares to the other and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall have no responsibility with respect to information or statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement which were based on information supplied by or on behalf of Parent.
 

(b)     The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request
from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the
other hand, and all written comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received by the Company from the SEC and advise Parent of
any material oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. Parent shall and
shall cause its Representatives to assist and cooperate with the Company and its Representatives in the resolution of any such
comments from the SEC related thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the preliminary or definitive draft of the Proxy
Statement with the SEC, mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or responding to any comments of
the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response in advance (including the proposed final version of such document or response), provided that such period shall not exceed
five Business Days, and the Company shall consider in good faith any comments provided by Parent or any of its Representatives with
respect thereto.
 

(c)     If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, any information relating to the
Company or Parent, respectively, or any of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, respectively, should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy
Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing
with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the extent required by Legal
Requirement, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment or supplement to shareholders of the Company. Nothing
in this Section 5.7(c) shall limit the obligations of any Party under Section 5.7(b).

(d)     For purposes of this Section 5.7, any information concerning or related to the Company, its Affiliates or the
Company Shareholder Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the Company, and any information concerning or related to
Parent or its Affiliates will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.
 

5.8     Company Shareholder Meeting.
 

(a)     As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts, in accordance with applicable Legal Requirement and the Company Articles and Company Bylaws, to establish a record date
for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholder Meeting. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders as promptly as practicable (and in any event within four Business Days)
following the later of (i) the resolution of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the preliminary Proxy
Statement, and (ii) the expiration of the ten day waiting period provided in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act. The
Company shall, through the Company Board of Directors, recommend to its shareholders that they give the Company Shareholder
Approval, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval, except in each case to the extent that the Company Board of Directors shall have made a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.6. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.8, the Company
may postpone, recess or adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (but after consultation
with Parent) (i) to the extent required by any Legal Requirement or any court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) if as of the time for which
the Company Shareholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of
Company Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Shareholder Meeting or to the extent that at such time the Company has not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval at the Company Shareholder Meeting, (iii) to allow time for the filing and dissemination of, and a
sufficient period for evaluation by the Company’s shareholders of, any supplemental or amended disclosure document to the extent
that the Company’s Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel) is
necessary or required under any applicable Legal Requirement or (iv) the Company Board has effected a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Determination Date occurs,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Asset Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within two Business Days) following the later of (i) the resolution of any comments from the SEC or the
staff of the SEC with respect to the preliminary Asset Proxy Statement, and (ii) the expiration of the ten day waiting period provided
in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, and (ii) in accordance with applicable Legal Requirement and the Company
Articles and Company Bylaws, to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholder
Meeting to vote on the matters set forth in the Asset Proxy Statement.

Without the prior written consent of Parent, the approval of this Agreement, the Merger or the Asset Purchase (in accordance with
Section 5.7(a) above), the adjournment of the Company Shareholder Meeting, as necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes in favor of approval of this Agreement, and the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act
shall be the only matters (other than matters of procedure and matters required by applicable Legal Requirement to be voted on by the
Company’s shareholders in connection with the approval of this Agreement) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by the
shareholders of the Company at the Company Shareholder Meeting. Once the Company has established a record date for the Company
Shareholder Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record date for the Company Shareholder
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, unless, following consultation with Parent, required to do so by applicable Legal
Requirements (but the Company shall not be entitled to claim that the Company Board’s fiduciary duties require it to establish a new
record date) or the Company Articles or Company Bylaws.
 

(b)     The Company will use reasonable best efforts to hold the Company Shareholder Meeting as soon as
practicable after the Proxy Statement is mailed to the Company’s shareholders.
 

(c)     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has been previously terminated in full
compliance with Article IX, the Company agrees that (i) its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Shareholder Meeting shall not be affected by any Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) its obligations pursuant to this
Section 5.8 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal). Unless this Agreement is terminated in full compliance with Article IX, the
Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of the shareholders of the Company any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a
Superior Proposal) prior to the vote of the shareholders of the Company with respect to the Merger at the Company Shareholder
Meeting.
 

5.9     Disposition of Company Equity Awards. The Company Board, or a committee thereof consisting of Non-Employee
Directors (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt resolutions in advance of the
Effective Time providing that, in connection with the Transactions, the disposition of any Company Common Stock or Company
Equity Awards and/or receipt of Parent Stock by Exchange Act Section 16 reporting persons is intended to be exempt from Exchange
Act Section 16(b) liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.
 

5.10     Shareholder Litigation. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Article IX and subject to applicable Legal Requirement: (a) the Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing of any shareholder
litigation against the Company or its directors relating to this Agreement, the Transactions or the Merger and shall keep Parent
informed regarding any such shareholder litigation; and (b) the Company shall give Parent reasonable opportunity, at Parent's sole cost
and expense, to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in the defense of any action, claim, suit or proceeding
against the Company or its directors or officers relating to this Agreement, the Transactions or the Merger, and no settlement of such
shareholder litigation in excess of the amount covered by the Company Insurance Policies (excluding payment of the applicable policy
deductible) will be agreed to or offered without the prior written consent of Parent; provided, that any settlement within the amount
covered by the Company Insurance Policies (including payment of the applicable policy deductible) may be agreed to and offered by
the Company or its directors and officers without the prior consent of Parent. Each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate in the defense or negotiation or settlement of any litigation contemplated by this Section
5.10. The parties acknowledge that this Section 5.10 in no way limits the parties' obligations under Section 5.4.

5.11     401(k) Plans. Unless otherwise requested in writing by Parent no later than ten days prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action as is necessary to
terminate any Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code
(collectively, the “Company 401(k) Plans”), effective no later than the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and, effective as
of such date, no employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have any right thereafter to contribute any amounts to the
Company 401(k) Plans. The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment, in advance of any
such adoption or corporate action, on any such resolutions or corporation actions.
 

5.12     Resignations. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause any director and any officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries identified by Parent to execute and deliver a letter effectuating his or her resignation as a director or officer (but
not as an employee) of such entity effective as of the Effective Time. At the request of Parent, the Company will use reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with Parent to effect the replacement of any such directors and officers selected by Parent at the Effective Time.
 

5.13     Disposition. During the period from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with the terms set forth in Article IX of this Agreement or the Closing Date, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to enter into an agreement to effectuate the sale of the Company’s G.hn/HPNA business (the
“Divestiture”), on the terms approved by Parent; provided that the foregoing shall not reduce or eliminate the Company’s obligations
pursuant to Section 5.1(f).
 

ARTICLE VI

Additional Covenants of Parent
 

6.1     Fulfillment of Conditions. From the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to fulfill the conditions specified in Article VIII. The foregoing obligation includes, without limitation, (a) executing and
delivering documents as are necessary or desirable to consummate the Transactions, (b) taking or refraining from such actions as may
be necessary to fulfill such conditions.

6.2     Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance.
 

(a)     Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by
the Company or its Subsidiaries now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries (each an
“Indemnified Party”) as provided in the Company Articles and Company Bylaws or similar governing documents of the Company’s
Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date of this
Agreement and disclosed in Section 6.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the “Indemnification Contracts”) for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger) shall be honored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and shall survive the Merger and
shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and such
Indemnification Contracts.
 

(b)     For six years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirement,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation and any successor to the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or its successor to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, Judgments and fines arising directly or indirectly, in whole or in part out of actions or omissions in their
capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the Transactions), and shall advance and/or
reimburse each Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with
investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, Judgments and fines as the same are incurred,
subject to the Surviving Corporation’s receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and
expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable Judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Legal Requirement; provided, however, that the Surviving
Corporation will not be liable for any settlement effected without the Surviving Corporation’s prior written Consent.
 

(c)     Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate period of not less than six years from
the Effective Time, the Company’s current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for
events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the “D&O Insurance”) that is no less favorable than the Company’s existing policy as of
the date of this Agreement or, if insurance coverage that is no less favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided,
however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an aggregate premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 300%
of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement or, if less, the cost of a policy providing coverage on the same
terms as the Company’s existing policy as of the date of this Agreement; provided, further, that the Company may prior to the
Effective Time substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage with respect to D&O Insurance with an aggregate cost not in excess
of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement; provided, that the Company shall give Parent a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of such policy and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent with respect thereto.

(d)     The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.2 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 6.2 applies without the Consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified
Parties to whom this Section 6.2 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.2, each of whom may enforce the provisions
of this Section 6.2).
 

(e)     The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to
which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Legal Requirement, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’ insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its officers, directors and employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.2 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such
policies.

Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.2(c) if the failure of such Company Shareholder Approval to be obtained is directly attributable

representations and warranties; and (B) the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.2(c)

9.5     Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination. The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Article
IX (other than pursuant to Section 9.1) shall deliver written notice of such termination to each other Party specifying with particularity
the reason for such termination, and any such termination in accordance with this Section 9.5 shall be effective immediately upon
delivery of such written notice to the other Parties; provided, however, that any purported termination of this Agreement by the

Representative of such Party) to any other Party hereto, except (i) with respect to Section 5.2(b), this Section 9.5, Section 9.6 and

(a)     If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.3(a), or (ii) by the Company pursuant to
Section 9.4(a), or (iii) by the Company (if such termination by the Company is at a time when Parent would have been entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.2(c)) or Parent pursuant to Section 9.2(c) if any of the events set forth in Section 9.3(a)
occurred prior to the duly convened Company Shareholder Meeting, then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds), within two Business Days after such termination, the Termination Fee.
 

(b)     Except as set forth in the immediately following sentence, if (i) after the date of this Agreement, but prior to
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, (x) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced, (y) an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been otherwise made known to the Company Board or the Company’s executive officers or (z) any
person shall have publicly announced or otherwise made known to the Company Board or the Company’s executive officers, an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement, (ii) thereafter, this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.2(c) hereof and (iii) within twelve months following the date of such termination
of this Agreement the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal which is
ultimately consummated, or any Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated, then in any such event the Company shall pay to
Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), no later than two Business Days following the consummation of such
transaction, the Termination Fee, (it being understood solely for the purpose of clause (iii) of this sentence, all references in the
definition of Acquisition Proposal to 15% shall be deemed to be references to “more than 50%” instead). Notwithstanding the
immediately foregoing sentence, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.3(b) hereof (or Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.2(c)
hereof at a time when Parent would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3(b) hereof) and within
twelve months following the date of such termination of this Agreement the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal which is ultimately consummated, or any Acquisition Proposal shall have been
consummated, then in any such event the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds), no later than
two Business Days following the consummation of such transaction, the Termination Fee (it being understood for all purposes of this
sentence, all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to 15% shall be deemed to be references to “more than 50%” instead).

(c)     Subject to Section 10.9, the Parties agree that the payment of the Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive monetary remedy available to Parent and Merger Sub with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby in the event any such payment becomes due and payable, and, upon payment of the Termination Fee by the Company, the
Company, the Company’s Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders and Representatives shall
have no further liability to Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination
Fee is not intended to be a penalty but is rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is due and payable, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall the Company be
obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.
 

(d)     The Company acknowledges and hereby agrees that the provisions of this Section 9.6 are an integral part of
the Transactions (including the Merger) and that, without such provisions, Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this
Agreement. If the Company shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this Section 9.6, and, in order to obtain
such payment, Parent makes a claim against the Company therefor that results in a Judgment against the Company, the Company shall
pay to Parent the reasonable and documented costs and expenses of Parent (including its reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses)
incurred or accrued in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 9.6 at the prime lending
rate prevailing during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal. Any interest payable hereunder shall be calculated on a
daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be paid until (but excluding) the date of actual payment.
 

(e)     All Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions will be paid by the Party
incurring such Expenses.
 

9.7     Amendment. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all
respects, whether before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, by written agreement signed by each of the Parties
hereto; provided, however, that following the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, there shall be no amendment or
supplement to the provisions of this Agreement which by Legal Requirement or in accordance with the rules of any relevant self-
regulatory organization would require further approval by the holders of the Company Shares without such approval.
 

9.8     Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other Party(ies), (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party(ies) contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered
under this Agreement, or (c) unless prohibited by applicable Legal Requirement, waive compliance with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any extension or waiver will be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by such Party. The failure or delay of any Party to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights.

OPINION OF SIGMA’S FINANCIAL ADVISOR DATED DECEMBER 7, 2017
 

Deutsche Bank
 
 
December 7, 2017
 
Board of Directors
Sigma Designs, Inc.
47467 Fremont Blvd.
Fremont, CA 94538
 
 
 
Gentlemen: 
 
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (“Deutsche Bank”) has acted as financial advisor to Sigma Designs, Inc. (the
“Company”) in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 7, 2017 (the “Merger
Agreement”), by and among Silicon Laboratories Inc. (”Parent”), Seguin Merger Subsidiary, Inc., a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and the Company which provides, among other things, for the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, as a result of which the Company will become a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger Transaction”). As set forth more fully in the Merger Agreement, as a
result of the Merger Transaction, each share of common stock, without par value (the “Company Common
Stock”), of the Company, other than dissenting shares and shares owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub will be converted into the right to
receive $7.05 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”).
 
You have requested our opinion, as investment bankers, as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, excluding Parent
and its affiliates.
 
In connection with our role as financial advisor to the Company, and in arriving at our opinion, we reviewed
certain publicly available financial and other information concerning the Company, and certain internal
analyses, financial forecasts and other information relating to the Company prepared by management of the
Company taking into account the assumed divestitures of the Company’s Smart TV and Media Connectivity
businesses (the “Proposed Divestitures”). We have also held discussions with certain senior officers and other
representatives and advisors of the Company regarding the businesses and prospects of the Company. In
addition, we have (i) reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock,
(ii) compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with, to the extent publicly
available, similar information for certain other companies we considered relevant whose securities are publicly
traded, (iii) reviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain recent business
combinations which we deemed relevant, (iv) reviewed the Merger Agreement, and (v) performed such other
studies and analyses and considered such other factors as we deemed appropriate.

This opinion has been approved and authorized for issuance by a Deutsche Bank fairness opinion review
committee and is addressed to, and is for the use and benefit of, the Board of Directors of the Company in
connection with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the Merger Transaction. This opinion is limited to the
fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock
(other than Parent and its affiliates) as of the date hereof. This opinion does not address any other terms of the
Merger Transaction, the Merger Agreement (including the closing conditions contained therein) or any other
agreement entered into or to be entered into in connection with the Merger Transaction or the Proposed
Divestitures. Nor do we express any opinion with respect to the Asset Purchase alternative contemplated by
the Merger Agreement (including the consideration to be received by the Company in connection with any such
Asset Purchase). You have not asked us to, and this opinion does not, address the fairness of the Merger
Transaction, or any consideration received in connection therewith, to the holders of any other class of
securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, nor does it address the fairness of the
contemplated benefits of the Merger Transaction. We express no opinion as to the merits of the underlying
decision by the Company to engage in the Merger Transaction or the Proposed Divestitures or the relative
merits of the Merger Transaction as compared to any alternative transactions or business strategies. Nor do
we express an opinion, and this opinion does not constitute a recommendation, as to how any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock should vote with respect to the Merger Transaction. In addition, we do not express
any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation
payable to or to be received by any of the Company’s officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such
persons, in connection with the Merger Transaction, whether relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise.
 
Deutsche Bank will be paid a fee for its services as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the
Merger Transaction, a portion of which becomes payable upon delivery of this opinion (or would have become
payable if Deutsche Bank had advised the Board of Directors that it was unable to render this opinion) and a
substantial portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Merger Transaction. The Company has
also agreed to reimburse Deutsche Bank for its expenses, and to indemnify Deutsche Bank against certain
liabilities, in connection with its engagement. We are an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG (together with its
affiliates, the “DB Group”). The DB Group may provide investment and commercial banking services to Parent,
the Company or their respective affiliates in the future, including with respect to the Proposed Divestitures, for
which we would expect the DB Group to receive compensation. In the ordinary course of business, members
of the DB Group may actively trade in the securities and other instruments and obligations of Parent, the
Company and their respective affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers.
Accordingly, the DB Group may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, instruments and
obligations.
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions, it is Deutsche
Bank's opinion as investment bankers that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock, excluding Parent and its affiliates.

ANNEX B-2

OPINION OF SIGMA’S FINANCIAL ADVISOR DATED FEBRUARY 15, 2018
 
Deutsche Bank

 
 
 
February 15, 2018
 
Board of Directors
Sigma Designs, Inc.
47467 Fremont Blvd.

Gentlemen:
 
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (“Deutsche Bank”) has acted as financial advisor to Sigma Designs, Inc. (the
“Company”) in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 7, 2017 (the “Merger
Agreement”), by and among Silicon Laboratories Inc. (“Parent”), Seguin Merger Subsidiary, Inc., a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and the Company which provides, among other things, that under
certain circumstances specified in Section 11.1 of the Merger Agreement, in lieu of consummating the Merger
(as defined in the Merger Agreement), (a) the Company and its subsidiaries will sell to Parent, and Parent will
purchase from the Company, all of the Company’s and its subsidiaries right, title and interest in and to the
Purchased Assets (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and (b) Parent will assume and the Company and its
subsidiaries shall assign all of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ Liabilities (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) which relate to the Business (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to Parent for an aggregate
purchase price of $240,000,000 (the “Consideration”). We refer to the transactions described in the preceding
sentence as the “Asset Sale”. We understand that the Company will proceed with the Asset Sale rather than
the Merger.
 
You have requested our opinion, as investment bankers, as to the fairness of the Consideration, from a
financial point of view, to the Company.
 
In connection with our role as financial advisor to the Company, and in arriving at our opinion, we reviewed
certain publicly available financial and other information concerning the Business and the Company, and
certain internal analyses, financial forecasts and other information relating to the Business and the Company
prepared by management of the Company. We have also held discussions with certain senior officers and
other representatives and advisors of the Company regarding the businesses and prospects of the Business
and the Company. In addition, we have (i) compared certain financial information for the Business with, to the
extent publicly available, similar information for certain other companies we considered relevant whose
securities are publicly traded, (ii) reviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain recent
business combinations which we deemed relevant, (iii) reviewed the Merger Agreement, and (iv) performed
such other studies and analyses and considered such other factors as we deemed appropriate.

similar matters. With respect to the financial forecasts made available to us and used in our analyses (the
“Forecasts”), we have assumed with your knowledge and permission that such Forecasts have been

respects material to our analysis, the Asset Sale will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the

would be material to our analysis. We also have assumed with your knowledge and permission that all material
governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required in connection with the consummation of the
Asset Sale will be obtained and that in connection with obtaining any necessary governmental, regulatory or
other approvals and consents, no restrictions, terms or conditions will be imposed that would be material to our
analysis. We are not legal, regulatory, tax or accounting experts and have relied on the assessments made by

This opinion has been approved and authorized for issuance by a Deutsche Bank fairness opinion review
committee and is addressed to, and is for the use and benefit of, the Board of Directors of the Company in
connection with and for the purpose of its evaluation relating to the making of a recommendation to holders of
common stock, without par value (the “Company Common Stock”), of the Company with respect to the Asset
Sale. This opinion is limited to the fairness of the Consideration, from a financial point of view, to the Company
as of the date hereof. This opinion does not address any other terms of the Asset Sale, the Merger Agreement
(including the closing conditions contained therein) or any other agreement entered into or to be entered into in
connection with the Asset Sale. You have not asked us to, and this opinion does not, address the fairness of
the Asset Sale, or any consideration received in connection therewith, to the holders of any class of securities,
creditors or other constituencies of the Company, nor does it address the fairness of the contemplated benefits
of the Asset Sale. We express no opinion as to the merits of the underlying decision by the Company to
engage in the Asset Sale or the relative merits of the Asset Sale as compared to any alternative transactions or
business strategies (including the Merger). Nor do we express an opinion, and this opinion does not constitute
a recommendation, as to how any holder of shares of Company Common Stock should vote with respect to the
Asset Sale or any other matter. In addition, we do not express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial
or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or to be received by any of the
Company’s officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such persons, in connection with the Asset Sale,
whether relative to the Consideration or otherwise. This opinion does not address how the Company may use
the Consideration or any action that the Company may take following the Asset Sale, including the terms of
any liquidation that the Company may undertake following the Asset Sale.
 
Deutsche Bank will be paid a fee for its services as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the
Asset Sale, a portion of which became payable upon delivery of Deutsche Bank’s December 7, 2017 opinion to
the Board of Directors, an additional portion of which became payable upon delivery of this opinion (or would
have become payable if Deutsche Bank had advised the Board of Directors that it was unable to render this
opinion), and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Asset Sale. The Company
has also agreed to reimburse Deutsche Bank for its expenses, and to indemnify Deutsche Bank against certain
liabilities, in connection with its engagement. We are an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG (together with its
affiliates, the “DB Group”). The DB Group may provide investment and commercial banking services to Parent,
the Company or their respective affiliates in the future (including with respect to additional divestitures and/or a
liquidation of the Company) for which we would expect the DB Group to receive compensation. In the ordinary
course of business, members of the DB Group may actively trade in the securities and other instruments and
obligations of Parent, the Company and their respective affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of
their customers. Accordingly, the DB Group may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities,
instruments and obligations.
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions, it is Deutsche
Bank’s opinion as investment bankers that, as of the date hereof, the Consideration is fair, from a financial
point of view, to the Company.

grant the rights to Parent set forth herein and therein and to perform Shareholder’s obligations hereunder and thereunder. This

jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or the validity or
enforceability of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the

8.6     Assignment; Binding Effect. Except as provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the interests or
obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated by either party, and any attempted or purported assignment or delegation of
any of such interests or obligations shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon
Shareholder and Shareholder’s heirs, estate, executors, successors and permitted assigns and shall inure to the benefit of Parent and
its successors and permitted assigns. Without limiting any of the restrictions set forth in Section 2, Section 3 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, this Agreement shall be binding upon any Person to whom any Subject Securities are Transferred. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to confer on any Person (other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns)
any rights or remedies of any nature.
 

8.7     Independence of Obligations. The covenants and obligations of Shareholder set forth in this Agreement shall be
construed as independent of any other Contract or arrangement between Shareholder, on the one hand, and the Company or Parent,
on the other. The existence of any claim or cause of action by Shareholder against the Company or Parent shall not constitute a
defense to the enforcement of any of covenants or obligations of Shareholder under this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be construed as limiting any of the rights or remedies of any party under the Merger Agreement or any of the rights or
remedies of the Company or Parent or any of the obligations of Shareholder under any Contract between Shareholder and Parent
or any certificate or instrument executed by Shareholder in favor of Parent; and nothing in the Merger Agreement or in any other
such Contract, certificate or instrument shall limit any of Shareholder’s obligations, or any of the rights or remedies of Parent,
under this Agreement.
 

8.8     Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party
agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the other party of any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement, such party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it, including monetary damages)
to (a) a decree or order from a court of competent jurisdiction of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance
of such covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or overtly threatened breach. Each party further
agrees that neither the other party nor any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument
in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 8.8, and each party irrevocably waives any
right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.
 

8.9     No Agreement Until Executed. This Agreement shall not be effective unless and until (i) the Merger Agreement is
executed by all parties thereto and (ii) this Agreement is executed by Parent and Shareholder.
 

8.10     Non-Exclusivity. The rights and remedies of Parent and Shareholder under this Agreement are not exclusive of or

(a)     This Agreement and all disputes, controversies, cross-claims, third-party claims or other Proceedings of
any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, arising out of or in connection with
or relating to any matter which is the subject of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of California, without regard to Laws that may be applicable
under conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of California.

venue of any United States federal court or California state court located in Santa Clara County, California, with respect to any
dispute arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

court; and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a United States federal or state court sitting in Santa Clara County, California, as
described above. Nothing in this Section 8.11(b) shall prevent any party from bringing an action or proceeding in any jurisdiction
to enforce any judgment entered by any United States federal court or California state court located in Santa Clara County,
California, as applicable. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by
U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth on the signature page hereof shall be effective service of process for any
suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.
 

8.12     Counterparts; Electronic Transmission. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of
which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same
instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by electronic delivery shall
be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms of this Agreement.

be a part of this Agreement and shall not be referred to in connection with the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.
 

8.14     Waiver. No failure on the part of any party hereto to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, and no delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right,
privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. No party
hereto shall be deemed to have waived any claim available to such party arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right,
privilege or remedy of such party under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such party; and any such waiver shall not be
applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall include the

respect to any Subject Securities. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Subject Securities shall remain
vested in and belong to Shareholder, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates shall have

EXHIBIT A
 

FORM OF IRREVOCABLE PROXY 
 

The undersigned shareholder (the “Shareholder”) of Sigma Designs, Inc., a corporation incorporated in the State of
California (the “Company”), hereby irrevocably (to the fullest extent permitted by law) appoints and constitutes Silicon
Laboratories Inc., a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware (“Parent”), or any nominee thereof, the sole and exclusive
attorney and proxy of the Shareholder, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote and exercise all voting rights (to
the fullest extent of the Shareholder’s rights to do so) solely with respect to the matters expressly set forth in this proxy and with
respect to (i) the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company owned of record by the Shareholder as of the record date of
any meeting of the shareholders of the Company at which such shares will be voted and (ii) any and all other shares of capital
stock of the Company that the Shareholder may acquire of record on or after the date hereof. (The shares of the capital stock of the
Company referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence are collectively referred to as the “Shares.”)
Upon the execution hereof, all prior proxies given by the Shareholder with respect to the voting of any Shares inconsistent with the
terms of this proxy and Section 3.1 of the Voting Agreement (as defined below) are hereby revoked, and the Shareholder agrees to
give no subsequent proxies with respect to the voting of any Shares inconsistent with the terms of this proxy and Section 3.1 of the
Voting Agreement until after the Termination Date.
 

This proxy is irrevocable; is coupled with an interest; and is granted in connection with, and as security for Shareholder’s
performance under, the Voting Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, between Parent and the Shareholder (the “Voting
Agreement”), and is granted in consideration of Parent’s entering into the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date
hereof, among Parent; Seguin Merger Subsidiary, Inc., a corporation incorporated in the State of California and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”); and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”). This
proxy will automatically terminate without any notice or other action by any party on the Termination Date (as defined in the
Voting Agreement). Capitalized terms used in this Proxy and not defined in this Proxy have the meanings set forth in the Voting
Agreement.
 

Each of the attorneys and proxies named above will be empowered, and may exercise this proxy, to vote the Shares at any
time until the Termination Date at any meeting of the shareholders of the Company, however called, and in connection with any
written action by consent of shareholders of the Company:
 

(a)     in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement, the Merger, the Agreement of Merger and
the Transactions; and
 

(b)     against the following actions (other than the Merger and the Transactions):
 

(i)     any Acquisition Proposal;
 

(ii)     any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in a
material breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the Company under the
Merger Agreement; or
 

(iii)     any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially
impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage, adversely affect, inhibit or attempt to discourage the timely consummation of
the Merger or the fulfillment of Parent’s or the Company’s or Merger Sub’s conditions under the Merger Agreement.

The Shareholder may vote the Shares on all other matters not referred to in this proxy, and Parent or any of the attorneys
and proxies named above shall not exercise this proxy for any purpose other than the purposes expressly set forth in this proxy.
 

All authority herein conferred shall survive the death or incapacity of the Shareholder and this proxy shall be binding
upon the heirs, estate, executors, successors and assigns of the Shareholder (including any transferee of any of the Shares).
 

Any term or provision of this proxy that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this proxy or the validity or enforceability of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this proxy is invalid or unenforceable, the court making such determination shall
have the power to limit such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or provision with a term
or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
provision, and this proxy shall be valid and enforceable as so modified.

SIGMA DESIGNS, INC.
 

This Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution (this or the “Plan”), is intended to accomplish the wind down of operations,
liquidation of assets and complete dissolution of Sigma Designs, Inc., a California corporation (the “Company”), in accordance with
the laws of the State of California, including but not limited to Chapters 19 and 20 and other applicable provisions of the California

thereunder.

 
1.           Recommendation of this Plan by the Board.  The Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) has recommended

that the Company’s shareholders approve the complete dissolution of the Company as set forth in this Plan. If the Plan is adopted by
the requisite vote of the Company’s shareholders, the Plan shall constitute the adopted Plan of the Company.

 
2.           Adoption of this Plan by the Company’s Shareholders. This Plan will be effective upon the approval by the holders

of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon at a special or annual
meeting of the shareholders of the Company called for such purpose by the Board.  The date of such shareholder approval is referred
to in this Plan as the “Effective Date.”
 

3.           Dissolution and Liquidation Period. Upon the occurrence of the Effective Date, the steps set forth below shall be
completed at such times as the Board, in its absolute discretion, deems necessary, appropriate or advisable:

 
a.     the filing of a Certificate of Election to Wind Up and Dissolve with the California Secretary of State’s office

(the “Certificate of Election”), specifying the matters required by applicable law;
 
b.     the notice of dissolution and the winding up to be sent by mail to all shareholders who did not vote in favor of

the election to dissolve and to each known creditor and claimant whose addresses appear on the records of the Company;
 
c.     the filing of a Certificate of Dissolution with the California Secretary of State’s office (the “Certificate of

Dissolution”), specifying the matters required by applicable law;
 
d.     the cessation of all of the Company’s business activities and the withdrawal of the Company from any

jurisdiction in which it is qualified to do business;
 

e.     the negotiation and consummation of sales and conversion of all of the assets and properties of the Company,
including all other tangible assets, intellectual property and other intangible assets, in one or more transactions upon such terms and
conditions as the Board, in its absolute discretion, deems expedient and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders,
without any further vote or action by the Company’s shareholders, into cash and/or other distributable form, including the assumption
by the purchaser or purchasers of any or all liabilities of the Company;

 
f.     the (i) payment or making adequate provision for the payment of all claims and obligations of the Company,

including all contingent, conditional or unmatured claims known to the Company; (ii) making adequate provision as will be
reasonably likely to be sufficient for the payment of any claim against the Company which is the subject of a pending action, suit or
proceeding to which the Company is a party; and (iii) making adequate provision as will be reasonably likely to be sufficient for the
payment of claims that have not been made known to the Company or that have not arisen but that, based on facts known to the
Company, are likely to arise or to become known to the Company;

 
g.    the filing of all final tax returns, making of all final payments, and closing of any tax accounts or obligations

required by any state or federal law or regulation to effect the winding up of the Company’s business and affairs and the dissolution of
the Company, including, but not limited to, the filing of Internal Revenue Service Form 966, the Certificate of Election, if required,

h.    the taking of any action to effectuate the Plan deemed necessary, appropriate or advisable in the absolute
discretion of the Board that is consistent with the dissolution procedures of the law of the State of California.       

 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Board may instruct the officers of the Company to delay the taking of

any of the foregoing steps until the Company has performed such actions as the Board or such officers determine to be necessary,
appropriate or advisable for the Company to maximize the value of the Company’s assets upon liquidation; provided, that such steps
may not be delayed longer than is permitted by applicable law.
 

4.            Authority of Officers and Directors.
 

 
a.           After the Effective Date, the Board and the officers of the Company (subject to the Board’s discretion) shall

continue in their positions, as necessary, for the purpose of winding up the affairs of the Company as contemplated by California law
and in accordance with this Plan.  The Board may appoint officers, hire employees and retain independent contractors and advisors in
connection with the winding up process, and is authorized to pay to the Company’s officers, directors and employees, or any of them,
compensation or additional compensation above their regular compensation, in money or other property, in recognition of the
extraordinary efforts they, or any of them, shall be required to undertake, or actually undertake, in connection with the successful
implementation of this Plan. Adoption of this Plan shall constitute the approval by the Company’s shareholders of the Board’s
authorization of the payment of any such compensation.

 
b.           Adoption of the Plan shall constitute the Company’s shareholders’ grant of full and complete authority for

the Board and the officers of the Company, without further shareholder action, to do and perform any and all acts and to make, execute
and deliver any and all agreements, conveyances, assignments, transfers, certificates and other documents of any kind and character
that the Board or such officers deem necessary, appropriate or advisable in furtherance of this Plan, including (i) to dissolve the
Company in accordance with the laws of the State of California and cause its withdrawal from all jurisdictions in which it is
authorized to do business, (ii) to proceed with the sale, exchange or other disposition of the Company’s assets and to pay, transfer and
distribute the remaining assets and remaining liabilities to the Company’s creditors and shareholders, as appropriate, or otherwise to
sell, dispose, convey, transfer and deliver all of the assets and properties of the Company, (iii) to satisfy or provide for the satisfaction
of the Company’s obligations in accordance with the law of the State of California, (iv) to prepare and give such notices and make
such filings under federal and state securities laws and the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market or, if applicable, the OTC Markets
Group Inc. trading venue OTCQB as may be required to effect this Plan, and (v) for the Board to distribute any properties and assets
of the Company and all remaining funds pro rata to the shareholders of the Company’s common stock in accordance with the
respective number of shares then held of record as of the date that the Certificate of Dissolution becomes effective or such other date
as the Board shall determine in its sole discretion.

 
5.            Conversion of Assets Into Cash and/or Other Distributable Form.

 
a.           Subject to approval by the Board, the officers, employees and agents of the Company shall, as promptly as

feasible, proceed to (i) collect all sums due or owing to the Company, (ii) sell and convert into cash and/or other distributable form all
the assets and properties of the Company, if any, and (iii) out of the assets and properties of the Company, pay, satisfy and discharge or
make adequate provision for the payment, satisfaction and discharge of all debts and liabilities of the Company pursuant to Section 4
above, including all expenses of the sales of assets and of the dissolution and liquidation provided for by the Plan.

b.           Adoption of the Plan, including shareholder approval, shall constitute full and complete authority for the
sale, exchange or other disposition of the properties and assets of the Company contemplated by the Plan, whether such sale, exchange
or other disposition occurs in one transaction or a series of transactions to one or more buyers, and shall constitute ratification of all
such contracts for sale, exchange or other disposition.  The Company shall not be required to obtain appraisals, fairness opinions or
other third-party opinions as to the value of its properties and assets in connection with the liquidation, but may do so in the Board’s
sole discretion.   The Company may invest in such interim assets as determined by the Board in its discretion, pending conversion to
cash or other distributable forms.

 
6.           Professional Fees and Expenses.

 
a.           It is specifically contemplated that the Board may authorize the payment of a retainer fee to a law firm or

law firms selected by the Board for legal fees and expenses of the Company, including, among other things, to cover any costs payable
pursuant to the indemnification of the Company’s officers or members of the Board provided by the Company pursuant to its
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (“Articles of Incorporation”) and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”), the
GCL, contractual arrangements or otherwise.

 
b.           In addition, in connection with and for the purpose of implementing and assuring completion of this Plan,

the Company may, in the sole and absolute discretion of the Board, pay any brokerage, agency and other fees and expenses of persons
rendering services, including accountants and tax advisors, to the Company in connection with the collection, sale, exchange or other
disposition of the Company’s property and assets and the implementation of this Plan.

 
7.           Indemnification.  The Company shall continue to indemnify and advance expenses to its officers, directors,

employees and agents in accordance with its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and any contractual arrangements, for actions taken
in connection with this Plan and the winding up of the affairs of the Company. The Board, in its sole and absolute discretion, is
authorized to obtain and maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and any other insurance as may be necessary, appropriate
or advisable to cover the Company’s obligations.

 
8.           Liquidating Distributions.

 
a.           Liquidating distributions, if any, shall be made from time to time before or after the filing of the Certificate

of Dissolution to the shareholders of record, at the close of business on the Effective Date or such other date as may be determined by
the Board in its sole discretion, pro rata to shareholders of the Company’s common stock in accordance with the respective number of
shares then held of record; provided that in the opinion of the Board adequate provision has been made for the payment, satisfaction
and discharge of all known, unascertained or contingent debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company (including costs and
expenses incurred and anticipated to be incurred in connection with the sale and distribution of assets and liquidation of the
Company).  Liquidating distributions shall be made in cash or in kind, including in stock of, or ownership interests in, subsidiaries of
the Company and remaining assets of the Company, if any.  Such distributions may occur in a single distribution or in a series of
distributions, in such amounts and at such time or times as the Board in its absolute discretion, and in accordance with the GCL, may
determine; provided, however, that the Company shall complete the distribution of all its properties and assets to its shareholders as
provided in this Section 8 following the filing of its Certificate of Dissolution with the Secretary of State of the State of California (the
“Final Distribution”).

 
b.           If and to the extent deemed necessary, appropriate or desirable by the Board in its absolute discretion, the

Company may establish and set aside a reasonable amount of cash and/or property to satisfy claims against the Company and its
subsidiaries and other obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries (a “Contingency Reserve”), including (i) tax obligations, (ii) all
expenses of the sale of the Company’s property and assets, (iii) the salary, fees and expenses of members of the Board, management
and employees, (iv) expenses for the collection and defense of the Company’s property and assets, (v) the expenses described in
Section 6 above and (vi) all other expenses related to the dissolution and liquidation of the Company and the winding-up of its affairs.
Any unexpended amounts remaining in a Contingency Reserve shall be distributed to the Company’s shareholders no later than the
Final Distribution.

c.           Distributions made pursuant to the Plan are intended to be treated as made in complete liquidation of the
Company within the meaning of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The adoption of the Plan by shareholder
approval shall constitute full and complete authority for the making by the Board of all distributions contemplated in this Section 8.

 
9.           Liquidating Trusts. The Board may but is not required to establish a Liquidating Trust (the “Liquidating Trust”) and

distribute assets of the Company to the Liquidating Trust. The Liquidating Trust may be established by agreement with one or more
trustees selected by the Board. Any Liquidating Trust established by the Board must satisfy the requirements for classification as a
“liquidating trust” under Procedure and Administration Regulations section 301.7701-4(d).  If the Liquidating Trust is established by
agreement with one or more trustees, the trust agreement establishing and governing the Liquidating Trust shall be in form and
substance determined by the Board. The trustees shall in general be authorized to take charge of the Company’s property, and to sell
and convert into cash or other distributable form any and all corporate non-cash or non-distributable assets and collect the debts and
property due and belonging to the Company, with power to prosecute and defend, in the name of the Company, or otherwise, all such
suits as may be necessary or proper for the foregoing purposes, and to appoint an agent under it and to do all other acts which might be
done by the Company that may be necessary, appropriate or advisable for the final settlement of the unfinished business of the
Company.

 
10.           Unallocated Shareholders. Any cash or other property held for distribution to shareholders of the Company who

have not been located at the time of the Final Distribution shall be transferred to the official of such state or other jurisdiction
authorized by applicable law to receive the proceeds of such distribution.  Such cash or other property shall thereafter be held by such
person(s) solely for the benefit of and ultimate distribution, without interest thereon, to such former shareholder or shareholders
entitled to receive such assets, who shall constitute the sole equitable owners thereof, subject only to such escheat or other laws as may
be applicable to unclaimed funds or property, and thereupon all responsibilities and liabilities of the Company with respect thereto
shall be satisfied and exhausted.  In no event shall any of such assets revert to or become the property of the Company.

 
11.           Amendment, Modification or Abandonment of Plan. If for any reason the Board determines that such action would

be in the best interests of the Company, it may amend, modify or abandon the Plan and all actions contemplated thereunder, including
the proposed dissolution of the Company, notwithstanding shareholder approval of the Plan, to the extent permitted by the GCL;
provided, however, that the Board shall not abandon the Plan following the filing of the Certificate of Election without first obtaining
the approval of the shareholders of record on the date the Certificate of Election was filed. Upon the abandonment of the Plan, the Plan
shall be void.

 
12.           Cancellation of Stock and Stock Certificates.

 
a.           After known liabilities of the Company have been paid to the full extent possible and the remaining assets

of the Company, if any, have been distributed to the shareholders, the shareholders shall surrender any and all certificates representing
the stock of the Company and shall have no further rights against the Company, whether arising out of each shareholder’s status as a
shareholder or as a creditor of the Company.

 
b.           On or after the close of business on the date that the Certificate of Dissolution becomes effective, subject to

applicable law, (i) each holder of shares of common stock of the Company shall cease to have any rights in respect thereof other than
in accordance with this Plan, and (ii) the Company’s share transfer books shall be closed and thereafter certificates representing shares
of stock of the Company will not be assignable or transferable on the books of the Company except by will, intestate succession, or
operation of law.  As a condition to receipt of any distribution to the Company’s shareholders, the Board, in its absolute discretion,
may require the Company’s shareholders to (i) surrender their certificates evidencing their shares of stock to the Company, or (ii)
furnish the Company with evidence satisfactory to the Board of the loss, theft, or destruction of such certificates, together with such
surety bond or other security or indemnity as may be required and satisfactory to the Board.

13.           Liquidation under Code Sections 331 and 336. It is intended that this Plan shall be a plan of complete liquidation of
the Company in accordance with the terms of Sections 331 and 336 of the Code.  The Plan shall be deemed to authorize the taking of
such action as, in the opinion of counsel to the Company, may be necessary to conform with the provisions of those Sections 331 and
336 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

ANNEX E
 

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION
 
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
 
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), Sigma Designs, Inc.
(“Sigma” or the “Company”) also reports non-GAAP financial measures, as Sigma believes that evaluating its ongoing operating
results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for
financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in
isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the
non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financials measures. The Company presents non-GAAP
financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its operating results in a manner that focuses on what
management believes to be its core, ongoing business operations. Furthermore, non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company
may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures as those used by other companies; specifically, non-GAAP financial measures
used by the Company may be calculated differently than other companies. Investors should, therefore, exercise caution when
comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by Sigma to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies.
 
Sigma’s non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, stock-based compensation, one-time legal and
other professional fee expenses, net gain on the sale of and impairment of privately-held investments, impairment of purchased IP,
mask sets used in production and one-time restructuring charges. The tax amounts included in Sigma’s non-GAAP results approximate
its operating cash tax expense, similar to the liability reported on Sigma’s tax returns. In the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation
below, the Company has disclosed the impact of these income tax adjustments in its calculation of our non-GAAP financial results.
 
Sigma believes that its non-GAAP measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business
trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. Sigma also believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful
supplemental information for investors to evaluate Sigma’s operating results in the same manner as the research analysts that follow
Sigma’s progress, all of whom present non-GAAP projections in their published reports.
 
Sigma uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate and assess its performance and operating results on a consistent basis, and to measure
and compare its performance with the financial projections published by analysts as well as its direct competitors in the industry, many
of whom report financial results on a non-GAAP basis. The economic substance behind its decision to use non-GAAP measures is that
such measures approximate its controllable operating performance more closely than the most directly comparable GAAP financial
results. For example, Sigma’s management has no control over certain variables that have a major influence in the determination of
stock-based compensation. These variables include the volatility of its stock price and changing interest rates. Sigma believes that all
of these excluded expenses in its non-GAAP financial measures may not accurately reflect the underlying performance of its
continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred, even though some of these excluded items may be incurred and
reflected in Sigma’s GAAP financial results in the foreseeable future. Sigma believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial
measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of
the business and its ability to perform in subsequent periods.
