LifeLock, Inc.
60 East Rio Salado Parkway

Suite 400
Tempe, Arizona 85281

December 23, 2016

Dear LifeLock Stockholder:

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of stockholders, which we refer to as the “special meeting,” of LifeLock,
Inc., which we refer to as “LifeLock,” to be held on Thursday, January 26, 2017, at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati,
Professional Corporation, located at 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California 94304, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time.

At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on the adoption of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
November 20, 2016, as it may be amended from time to time, which we refer to as the “merger agreement,” by and among LifeLock,
Symantec Corporation, which we refer to as “Symantec,” and L1116 Merger Sub, Inc., which we refer to as “Acquisition
Sub.” Pursuant to the terms of and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, Acquisition Sub will merge with and into
LifeLock, with LifeLock continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Symantec. We refer to the
acquisition of LifeLock by Symantec as the “merger.” At the special meeting, you will also be asked to consider and vote on (1) a
proposal to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting, and (2) a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve
compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to its named executive officers in connection with the merger.

If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $24.00 in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable
withholding taxes, for each share of common stock that you own (unless you have properly and validly exercised your appraisal rights
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which we refer to as the “DGCL”). This amount represents a
premium of approximately 59.4% to the closing price of our common stock on June 16, 2016, the last trading day prior to the public
filing by Elliott Associates, L.P. and certain affiliates that they had accumulated a significant minority interest in LifeLock.

LifeLock’s Board of Directors, after considering the factors more fully described in the enclosed proxy statement, has
unanimously (1) determined that it is in the best interests of LifeLock and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter
into the merger agreement and consummate the merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement; (2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by LifeLock, the performance by LifeLock of its
covenants and other obligations in the merger agreement, and the consummation of the merger upon the terms and conditions
set forth in the merger agreement; (3) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at the special
meeting; and (4) resolved to recommend that the LifeLock stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement
in accordance with the DGCL.

LifeLock’s Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement;
(2) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) “FOR” the
approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger.

Table of Contents

The accompanying proxy statement provides detailed information about the special meeting, the merger agreement, the merger
and other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to the proxy
statement.

The proxy statement also describes the actions and determinations of LifeLock’s Board of Directors in connection with its
evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger. We encourage you to read the proxy statement and its annexes, including the
merger agreement, carefully and in their entirety, as they contain important information.

Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting in person, please sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the
enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone. If
you attend the special meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy that you have previously submitted.

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in
accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or other
nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the adoption of the merger agreement, without your instructions.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. We cannot complete the merger unless the
adoption of the merger agreement is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of common stock. The failure to vote, or the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote, will
have the same effect as a vote against the adoption of the merger agreement. The advisory vote on the named executive officer
merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. Accordingly,
you may vote to approve the adoption of the merger agreement and vote against the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal, and vice versa.

If you have any questions or need assistance voting your shares, please contact our proxy solicitor:

LifeLock’s Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement;

YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT

Whether or not you plan to attend the special meeting in person, we encourage you to submit your proxy as promptly as
possible (1) over the internet; (2) by telephone; or (3) by signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the
accompanying prepaid reply envelope. You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before it is voted at the special
meeting.

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in
accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or other
nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the adoption of the merger agreement, without your instructions.

If you are a LifeLock stockholder of record, voting in person by ballot at the special meeting will revoke any proxy that you
previously submitted. If you hold your shares through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must obtain a “legal proxy” from the bank,
broker or other nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote your shares in person at the special meeting.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. We cannot complete the merger unless the
adoption of the merger agreement is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding
shares of common stock. If you fail to (1) return your proxy card or instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote; (2) grant
your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone; or (3) vote by ballot in person at the special meeting, your shares will not
be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting and, if a quorum is present, will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no effect on the vote on the other two
proposals.

We encourage you to read this proxy statement and its annexes, including all documents incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement, carefully and in their entirety. If you have any questions concerning the merger, the special meeting or this proxy statement,
would like additional copies of this proxy statement or need help voting your shares of common stock, please contact our proxy
solicitor:

and in its entirety.

Table of Contents

L1116 Merger Sub, Inc.

Acquisition Sub is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Symantec and was formed on November 17, 2016, solely for the
purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and has not engaged in any business activities other
than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Acquisition Sub’s principal executive office is located at 350 Ellis Street, Mountain View, California 94043 and its telephone
number is (650) 527-8000.

Effect of the Merger

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, Acquisition Sub will merge with and into LifeLock,
with LifeLock continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Symantec. Throughout this proxy
statement, we use the term “surviving corporation” to refer to LifeLock as the surviving corporation following the merger. As a
result of the merger, LifeLock will cease to be a publicly traded company and will be delisted from the NYSE. If the merger is
completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation.

The time at which the merger will become effective, which we refer to as the “effective time of the merger,” will occur upon
the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as LifeLock, Symantec
and Acquisition Sub may agree and specify in such certificate of merger).

Effect on LifeLock if the Merger is Not Completed

If the merger agreement is not adopted by LifeLock stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason,
LifeLock stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, LifeLock will remain an
independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the “Exchange Act,” and we will continue to file periodic
reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the “SEC.” Under specified circumstances, LifeLock
will be required to pay Symantec a termination fee upon the termination of the merger agreement. For more information, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees.”

Merger Consideration

In the merger, each outstanding share of common stock of LifeLock, which we refer to as “common stock” (other than shares
held by (1) LifeLock as treasury stock; (2) Symantec or Acquisition Sub; (3) any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
LifeLock, Symantec or Acquisition Sub; and (4) LifeLock stockholders who have neither voted in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement nor consented thereto in writing and have properly and validly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights
under the DGCL with respect to such shares), will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to
receive $24.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, which amount we refer to as the “per share
merger consideration.” At or prior to the effective time of the merger, Symantec will deposit sufficient funds to pay the aggregate
per share merger consideration with a designated paying agent. Once a LifeLock stockholder has provided the paying agent with
his, her or its stock certificates (or customary agent’s message with respect to uncertificated shares), letter of transmittal and the
other items specified by the paying agent, the paying agent will promptly pay the LifeLock stockholder the per share merger
consideration. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Exchange and
Payment Procedures.”

After the merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the per share merger consideration, but you will no longer
have any rights as a LifeLock stockholder (except that LifeLock stockholders who properly and validly exercise and perfect their
appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the “fair value” of

their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by the DGCL, as described below under the section

Purpose

At the special meeting, we will ask LifeLock stockholders to vote on proposals to (1) adopt the merger agreement; (2) adjourn
the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that
will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote

You are entitled to vote at the special meeting if you owned shares of common stock at the close of business on December 21,
2016, which we refer to as the “record date.” You will have one vote on each matter properly brought before the special meeting
for each share of common stock that you owned as of the close of business on the record date.

Quorum

As of the record date, there were 94,947,772 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.
The presence at the special meeting in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the
common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote will constitute a quorum at the special meeting.

Required Vote

The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock is required to adopt the
merger agreement. Approval of the adjournment of the special meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special
meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become
payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the voting power of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to
vote on the proposal.

Share Ownership of Our Directors and Executive Officers

As of the record date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
2,040,516 shares of common stock, representing approximately 2.1% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the record
date. In addition, one of our directors, David Cowan, is affiliated with Bessemer

Table of Contents

Venture Partners, one of our larger stockholders, who beneficially owns as of the record date 5,540,485 shares of common stock,
representing approximately 5.8% of the shares of common stock outstanding as of the record date. Our directors and executive
officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote all of their shares of common stock (1) “FOR” the adoption of the
merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) “FOR”
the approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger.

Certain of our directors and executive officers as well as Bessemer Venture Partners have entered into a support agreement
whereby they have each agreed to vote their shares in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the other proposals set
forth in this proxy statement. At the close of business on December 21, 2016, the record date of the special meeting, these directors
and executive officers, as well as Bessemer Venture Partners, collectively owned or controlled 7,269,391 shares of common stock,
which represented 7.7% of all outstanding shares of common stock on the record date. For more information, see the section of this
proxy statement captioned “The Support Agreement.”

Voting and Proxies

Any LifeLock stockholder of record entitled to vote may submit a proxy by returning a signed proxy card in the
accompanying prepaid reply envelope or granting a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone. A LifeLock stockholder
of record may also vote in person by appearing at the special meeting and voting by ballot. If you are a beneficial owner and hold
your shares of common stock in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you should instruct your bank, broker or
other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of common stock using the voting instruction form provided by your bank,
broker or other nominee. Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or other nominees have the discretion to vote on
routine matters. The proposals to be considered at the special meeting are non-routine matters, and banks, brokers and
other nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore, it is important that you cast your vote
or instruct your bank, broker or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares. The failure to vote, or the failure to instruct
your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote, will have the same effect as a vote against the adoption of the merger
agreement.

If you are a LifeLock stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at
the special meeting by (1) signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it prior to the special meeting; (2) submitting a
new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy; (3) delivering a written
notice of revocation to our Secretary; or (4) attending the special meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for
instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the special meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy”
from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares in person at the special meeting.

Recommendation of the LifeLock Board and Reasons for the Merger

LifeLock’s Board of Directors, which we refer to as the “LifeLock Board,” after considering various factors described in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Recommendation of the LifeLock Board and Reasons for the Merger,” has
unanimously (1) determined that it is in the best interests of LifeLock and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into
the merger agreement and consummate the merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement;
(2) approved the execution and

delivery of the merger agreement by LifeLock, the performance by LifeLock of its covenants and other obligations in the merger
agreement, and the consummation of the merger upon the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement; (3) directed that
the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at the special meeting; and (4) resolved to recommend that the
LifeLock stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement in accordance with the DGCL. The LifeLock Board
unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the
special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) “FOR” the approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of
compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.

Fairness Opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co.

Goldman, Sachs & Co., which we refer to as “Goldman Sachs,” delivered its opinion to the LifeLock Board on November 20,
2016, which opinion was subsequently confirmed in a written opinion dated as of the same date, that, as of the date of such opinion
and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the per share merger consideration to be paid to the
holders (other than Symantec and its affiliates) of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point
of view to such holders.

The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated November 20, 2016, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the LifeLock Board in
connection with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder
of common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter. Pursuant to an engagement letter between
LifeLock and Goldman Sachs, LifeLock has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the
information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $24.5 million, $23.5 million of which is contingent
upon consummation of the merger.

For a more complete description, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Fairness Opinion of
Goldman, Sachs & Co.”

Treatment of Equity Awards in the Merger

The merger agreement provides that LifeLock’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger will be subject to the following treatment in the merger:

Stock Options

At the effective time of the merger, except with respect to any options to purchase shares of common stock held by
non-employee members of the LifeLock Board, whom we refer to as “non-employee directors,” (a) the portion of each option to
purchase shares of common stock, including those pursuant to LifeLock’s 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended, which
we refer to as the “2012 Plan,” LifeLock’s 2006 Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended, which we refer to as the “2006 Plan”
and Lemon, Inc.’s 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the “2008 Plan,” and together with the 2012 Plan and 2006
Plan, the “LifeLock Stock Plans,” but excluding LifeLock’s 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (which we refer to as the
“ESPP”), that is outstanding and unexercised immediately before the effective time of the merger and that is vested as of the
effective time of the merger and (b) any portion of an option to purchase common stock, including pursuant to the LifeLock Stock
Plans but not the ESPP, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately before the effective time of the merger that by its terms
accelerates vesting in connection with the holder of such option ceasing,

before, upon, or immediately after the effective time of the merger, to be a service provider of LifeLock or its subsidiaries, which
service providers we collectively refer to as “terminated service providers” and which options we collectively refer to as the
“vested options,” will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive cash amount(s), without interest and
subject to any required tax withholdings, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the total number of shares of common
stock issuable upon exercise in full of such vested option by (2) the excess, if any, of $24.00, over the applicable per share exercise
price of such cancelled vested option.

At the effective time of the merger, except with respect to options to purchase shares of common stock held by a non-
employee director, the portion of each option to purchase shares of common stock, including those pursuant to the LifeLock Stock
Plans but not the ESPP, that is outstanding immediately before and at the effective time of the merger, that is unvested, unexercised
and held by a LifeLock service provider at the effective time of the merger, which we refer to as the “unvested options,” will be
assumed by Symantec and automatically converted into an option to acquire Symantec common stock, on the same terms and
conditions applicable to the unvested option immediately before the effective time of the merger, including the term, exercisability,
and vesting schedule, provided that the number of shares of Symantec common stock subject to the option and the per share
exercise price will be adjusted based on an exchange ratio, which options we refer to as “assumed options.” The exchange ratio is
determined by dividing the per share merger consideration by the volume-weighted average of the trading prices of the shares of
Symantec common stock on NASDAQ for the ten trading days ending with and including the trading day that is the closing date of
the merger. Each assumed option will cover a number of shares of Symantec common stock equal to the number of shares of
common stock that were subject to the unvested option immediately before the effective time of the merger multiplied by the
exchange ratio, with the resulting number rounded down to the nearest whole share. The per share exercise price for each assumed
option will equal the per share exercise price for the unvested option immediately before the effective time of the merger, divided
by the exchange ratio, with the resulting number rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The assumed options also remain subject to
any applicable provisions under the LifeLock Stock Plan under which the award was granted or any stock option, employment,
change of control, or other plan or agreement between the holder of the assumed option and LifeLock.

Restricted Stock Units

At the effective time of the merger, except with respect to any restricted stock units covering shares of common stock held by
non-employee directors, (a) the portion of each restricted stock unit award covering shares of common stock outstanding and
unsettled immediately before the effective time of the merger, which we refer to as an “RSU,” that is vested as of the effective time
of the merger and (b) any portion of an RSU that by its terms accelerates vesting that is held by a terminated service provider,
which RSUs we collectively refer to as the “vested RSUs,” will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive
cash amount(s), without interest and subject to any required tax withholdings, equal to the total number of shares of common stock
subject to the vested RSU multiplied by the per share merger consideration.

At the effective time of the merger, except with respect to any RSU held by a non-employee director, each RSU that is held by
a LifeLock service provider as of the effective time of the merger that is unvested, outstanding and unsettled as of the effective
time of the merger, which we refer to as an “unvested RSU,” will be assumed by Symantec and automatically converted into an
RSU covering shares of Symantec common stock, on the same terms and conditions applicable to the unvested RSU immediately
before the effective time of the merger, including the term, settlement terms and vesting schedule, provided that the number of
shares of Symantec common stock will be equal to the number of shares of common stock subject to the unvested RSU
immediately before the effective time of the merger, multiplied by the exchange ratio, with the resulting number rounded down to
the nearest whole share. We refer to such converted RSUs as the “assumed RSUs.” The assumed RSUs also remain subject to any
applicable provisions under the LifeLock Stock Plan under which the

Table of Contents

award was granted or any restricted stock unit, employment, change of control or other plan or agreement between the holder of the
assumed RSU and LifeLock.

Restricted Stock Awards

At the effective time of the merger, each share of common stock that remains unvested and outstanding as of immediately
before the effective time of the merger (other than certain shares that are held by LifeLock as treasury stock, owned by Symantec
or Acquisition Sub or owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock, Symantec or Acquisition Sub and
other than certain shares that are held by holders who have neither voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement nor
consented thereto in writing and have properly and validly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights under the DGCL with
respect to such shares, which we refer to as the “RSAs” or “restricted stock,” will be cancelled and automatically converted into the
right to receive a cash amount, without interest and subject to any required tax withholdings, equal to the per share merger
consideration. Such cash payment will be retained by Symantec and will become payable only upon the occurrence of the date that
such RSAs would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such RSAs immediately before or at the effective
time of the merger (subject to the restrictions and other terms of such vesting schedule and giving effect to any applicable
agreement between the holder of such RSAs and Symantec).

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards

At the effective time of the merger, each LifeLock restricted stock award with performance-based vesting, which we refer to
as a “PRSA,” will be treated in accordance with the Notice of Grant of Performance-Based Restricted Stock Award and the
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Agreement governing the PRSA and any employment, change of control, or other plan or
agreement between the holder of the PRSA and LifeLock. Each share of common stock subject to the PRSA that remains unvested
and outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger will be treated in the same manner as RSAs, as described in
the immediately preceding paragraph above. Additional terms applicable to the PRSAs are described under the section of this
proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of
Equity-Based Awards.”

Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units Held by Non-Employee Directors

At the effective time of the merger, each option to purchase shares of common stock outstanding as of immediately before the
effective time of the merger, whether vested or unvested, that is held by an individual who is a non-employee director as of the
closing date of the merger and is outstanding as of immediately before the effective time of the merger, which we refer to as a
“director option,” will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive cash amount(s), without interest and
subject to any required tax withholdings, equal to the total number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise in full of such
option multiplied by the excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of such
cancelled option.

At the effective time of the merger, each RSU, whether vested or unvested, that is held by an individual who is a non-
employee director as of the closing date of the merger and is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, which we refer to as a “director RSU,” will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive cash
amount(s), without interest and subject to any required tax withholdings, equal to the total number of shares of common stock
subject to the RSU multiplied by the per share merger consideration.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Subject to the consummation of the merger, the ESPP will terminate as of the effective time of the merger. No new purchase
period or offer period will begin under the ESPP after the date of the merger agreement. The

merger agreement requires that participation in the ESPP be limited to those employees who were participants in the ESPP on the
date of the merger agreement and that each individual participating in the purchase period in progress on the date of the merger
agreement is not permitted to (1) increase his or her payroll contribution rate or (2) make separate non-payroll contributions that
would have the effect of providing such increase, in each case, pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in effect immediately before the
date of the merger agreement, unless as may be required by applicable law. Any purchase period under the ESPP that otherwise
would be outstanding as of the effective time of the merger will be terminated no later than one business day before the date on
which the effective time occurs and any adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect this shortened purchase period
will be made, but otherwise this shortened purchase period will be treated as a fully effective and completed purchase period for all
purposes under the ESPP. Any purchase right that is outstanding under the ESPP will be exercised no later than one business day
before the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs and shares purchased under the ESPP generally will be treated in
the same manner as other shares of common stock in the merger, which generally means that the shares will be converted into the
right to receive the per share merger consideration in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each
share of common stock held, unless the holder of such share has neither voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement nor
consented thereto in writing and has properly and validly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights under the DGCL with
respect to such shares.

Employee Benefits

From and after the effective time of the merger, Symantec has agreed that it will honor all of the LifeLock benefit plans and
compensation and severance arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the effective time of the
merger, including those related to our executive officers, as described under the section of this proxy statement captioned “Interests
of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments upon Change in Control or Termination in Connection
with Change in Control.” However, such benefit plans and compensation and severance arrangements may be amended or
terminated in accordance with their terms. For a period of one year following the effective time of the merger, Symantec has agreed
to either (1) maintain for the benefit of continuing employees LifeLock’s benefit plans (other than the opportunity to participate in
equity-based benefits, cash incentive, bonus, severance and subject to the merger agreement, individual employment agreements,
provided that any existing plans and agreements will be governed by and can only be amended according to their respective terms)
at benefit levels that are substantially equivalent to those in effect on the date of the merger agreement, and provide compensation
and benefits to each continuing employee pursuant to such benefit plans; (2) provide benefits to each continuing employee that,
taken as a whole, are substantially equivalent to those benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Symantec; or
(3) provide some combination of LifeLock and Symantec benefit plans such that each continuing employee receives benefits that,
taken as a whole, in any case with respect to clauses (1) through (3), are in the aggregate substantially equivalent to those benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Symantec. In addition, Symantec has agreed that during such one year period, any
continuing employee’s aggregate cash compensation, including base salary and target incentive compensation opportunity, payable
to him or her will not be reduced. Additionally, for a period of one year following the effective time of the merger, Symantec has
agreed to provide severance benefits that are substantially equivalent to those benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
Symantec and its affiliates.

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Employee Benefits.”

Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

When considering the recommendation of the LifeLock Board that you vote to approve the adoption of the merger agreement,
you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger

Table of Contents

that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a LifeLock stockholder. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger
agreement; (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger; and (3) recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by
LifeLock stockholders, the LifeLock Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time,
among other matters. These interests include the following:
 

 

•  the cash-out of all non-employee director options and RSUs, whether vested or unvested, as described in more detail
under the section of this proxy statement captioned “Summary—Treatment of Equity Awards in the Merger” and under
the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards;”

 

 

•  the entitlement of each executive officer to receive payments and benefits, including cash severance benefits and up to
100% vesting acceleration of the remaining unvested portion of certain equity awards, under his or her employment
agreement, severance plan participation agreement, or equity award agreement, as applicable, in connection with an
involuntary termination of employment other than for cause, including as a result of a constructive termination, as
applicable, during the period of up to 3 months prior to, and 18 months following, the effective time of the merger, as
described in more detail under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of LifeLock’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments upon Change in Control or Termination in Connection with
Change in Control;” and

 

 
•  LifeLock’s directors and executive officers are entitled to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the

merger agreement, as described in more detail under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance.”

If the adoption of the merger agreement is approved, the vested common stock held by our directors and executive officers
will be treated in the same manner as the common stock held by all other LifeLock stockholders. For more information, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

In addition, certain of our directors and executive officers as well as Bessemer Venture Partners, one of our larger
stockholders, which stockholder is affiliated with one of our directors, have entered into a support agreement whereby they have
each agreed to vote their shares in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the other proposals set forth in this proxy
statement. At the close of business on December 21, 2016, the record date of the special meeting, these directors and executive
officers, as well as Bessemer Venture Partners, collectively owned or controlled 7,269,391 shares of common stock, which
represented 7.7% of all outstanding shares of common stock on the record date. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Support Agreement.”

Financing of the Merger

The merger agreement is not subject to any financing contingency. Symantec intends to finance the cash portion of the merger
consideration with debt and cash on hand. With respect to the debt financing, Symantec has obtained a commitment, which we
refer to as the “Commitment,” from a syndicate of lenders consisting of Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &
Smith Incorporated, Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.
and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, which provides for a senior unsecured bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up
to $750,000,000.

On or prior to the closing date of the merger, Symantec expects to issue senior notes, which we refer to as the “Senior Notes.”
in a registered public offering, Rule 144A offering, or private placement. The Commitment will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar
basis by the gross cash proceeds actually funded into escrow or received by Symantec or any of its domestic subsidiaries from any
issuance of the Senior Notes on or prior to the closing date of the merger.

Table of Contents

The merger agreement also permits Symantec to secure a replacement debt commitment in lieu of drawing on the
Commitment, except, that such replacement commitment, were it structured as an amendment to the Commitment, may not (1)
reduce (or reasonably be expected to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of such debt financing, unless in the case of
a reduction in the amount of such debt financing, Symantec would retain sufficient funds (including, without limitation, cash on
hand and the proceeds of any replacement financing), to make all cash payments contemplated under the merger agreement, repay,
prepay or discharge all indebtedness of LifeLock under its existing credit agreement and pay all fees and expenses required to be
paid by Symantec at the closing of the merger, which we refer to as the “Required Amount,” and such reduction would not
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the closing of the merger or Symantec’s ability to consummate the debt financing; (2)
impose new or additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of
the debt financing or any other terms to the debt financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the
closing of the merger or make the timely funding of the debt financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining such debt
financing, less likely to occur; or (3) adversely impact the ability of Symantec, Acquisition Sub or LifeLock, as applicable, to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the commitment or the definitive agreements with respect thereto.

For more information on the debt financing, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Financing of the Merger.”

Appraisal Rights

If the merger is consummated, LifeLock stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who
continuously hold such shares through the effective time of the merger, who properly perfect appraisal of their shares and who
meet certain other conditions and statutory requirements described herein will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the
merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that LifeLock stockholders may be entitled to have their shares appraised by
the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of common stock, exclusive of
any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid on the
amount determined to be the fair value, if any, as determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any
voluntary cash payments made by LifeLock pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL, as described in more detail
below), so long as they comply with the procedures established by Section 262 of the DGCL. Due to the complexity of the
appraisal process, LifeLock stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.

LifeLock stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they
would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.

To exercise your appraisal rights, you must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to LifeLock before the vote is taken on
the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; and
(3) continue to hold your shares of common stock of record through the effective time of the merger. Your failure to follow exactly
the procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In addition, the Delaware Court of
Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings in respect of LifeLock unless certain stock ownership conditions are satisfied by the
LifeLock stockholders seeking appraisal, as described further below. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are
described in further detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is attached as
Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish
to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures
for the making of a demand for appraisal on your behalf by your bank, broker or other nominee.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined under the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for such U.S.
Holder’s shares of common stock in the merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by
the difference, if any, between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax
basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the merger.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of
common stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger.” LifeLock stockholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal
income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising
under U.S. federal income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

Under the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which we refer to as the “HSR Act,” has expired or otherwise been terminated.

Legal Proceedings Regarding the Merger

In connection with the announcement of the merger, two LifeLock stockholders filed purported class actions on behalf of a
class of all LifeLock stockholders. The first class action was filed on December 15, 2016, in Arizona Superior Court, Maricopa
County, and is captioned, Minzer v. LifeLock, Inc. et al, CV-2016-53742. We refer to this as the “Minzer Action.” The second class
action was filed on December 16, 2016, in the United States District Court of Arizona, and is captioned, Parshall v. LifeLock, Inc.
et al, Civ. No. 2:16-cv-04434-DKD. We refer to this as the “Parshall Action.” Both suits name as defendants LifeLock, Symantec
and Acquisition Sub, as well as Hilary Schneider, Roy Guthrie, Todd Davis, Gary Briggs, David Cowan, Albert Pimentel, Thomas
Ridge and Jaynie Miller Studenmund. We refer to these individuals named as defendants as the “Individual Defendants.” The
Minzer Action alleges that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to LifeLock stockholders, including the duties
of care, loyalty and good faith, by, among other things, causing LifeLock to agree to a merger transaction with Symantec at an
unfair price and pursuant to an unfair process, and by making disclosures in the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC
concerning the transaction that are materially misleading. Plaintiff Minzer also claims that Symantec and Acquisition Sub aided
and abetted the Individual Defendants’ breaches. Based on these allegations, the Parshall Action claims that LifeLock and the
Individual Defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Symantec and the Individual Defendants violated Section 20
of the Exchange Act. Both complaints seek to enjoin or rescind the merger, seek an award of unspecified damages, attorneys’ and
experts’ fees and costs, and request that the case be certified as a class action. LifeLock and the Individual Defendants believe that
the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit.

No Solicitation of Alternative Acquisition Offers

Under the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the merger
agreement and the effective time of the merger, LifeLock has agreed to cease and

cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with, and terminate any data room or other access to diligence of, any
person, its affiliates and its representatives (as defined below) relating to an acquisition transaction (as defined under the section of
this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative Acquisition Offers”) and to request any
person who executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of an acquisition transaction to promptly
return or destroy all non-public information furnished by or on behalf of LifeLock or its subsidiaries prior to the date of the merger
agreement.

Under the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the merger
agreement and the effective time of the merger, LifeLock and its subsidiaries, and their respective directors and executive officers
will not, and LifeLock will not authorize or direct, as the case may be, its subsidiaries and its and their respective affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents, representatives and advisors, whom we collectively refer to as “representatives,”
directly or indirectly, to: (1) solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly
encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an acquisition proposal (as defined
under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative Acquisition Offers”);
(2) furnish or otherwise provide access to any non-public information regarding, or to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or personnel of, LifeLock or its subsidiaries to any person in connection with, or with the intent to induce the making,
submitting or announcing of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist an acquisition proposal or the making of any proposal
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal; (3) participate, or engage in discussions or negotiations, with
any person with respect to an acquisition proposal or with respect to any inquiries from third parties relating to the making an
acquisition proposal; (4) approve, endorse, or recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an
acquisition proposal; (5) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or
other contract relating to an acquisition transaction (as defined under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative Acquisition Offers”); or (6) authorize or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Notwithstanding these restrictions, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by LifeLock stockholders, LifeLock may
furnish information to, and enter into negotiations or discussions with, a person regarding a written acquisition proposal if the
LifeLock Board determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel that (1) such
proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal (as defined under the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative Acquisition Offers”); and (2) failure to do so would be
reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law. For more information, see the section of
this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative Acquisition Offers.”

LifeLock is not entitled to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an agreement for a superior proposal unless it
complies with certain procedures in the merger agreement, including engaging in good faith negotiations with Symantec during a
specified period to amend the merger agreement. If LifeLock terminates the merger agreement in order to accept a superior
proposal, it must pay an $87.5 million termination fee to Symantec. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement—The LifeLock Board’s Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change.”

Change in the LifeLock Board’s Recommendation

The LifeLock Board may not withdraw its recommendation that LifeLock stockholders adopt the merger agreement or take
certain similar actions described in the merger agreement other than, under certain circumstances, if it determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably expected to be
inconsistent with the LifeLock Board’s fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law.

However, the LifeLock Board cannot withdraw its recommendation that LifeLock stockholders adopt the merger agreement
or take certain similar actions described in the merger agreement unless it complies with certain procedures in the merger
agreement, including engaging in good faith negotiations with Symantec during a specified period to amend the merger
agreement. If Symantec terminates the merger agreement because the LifeLock Board withdraws its recommendation that
LifeLock stockholders adopt the merger agreement or takes certain similar actions described in the merger agreement, then
LifeLock must pay an $87.5 million termination fee to Symantec. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement—The LifeLock Board’s Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change” and the
section captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees.”

Conditions to the Closing of the Merger

The obligations of LifeLock, Symantec and Acquisition Sub, as applicable, to consummate the merger are subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including:
 

 •  the adoption of the merger agreement by LifeLock stockholders;
 

 •  the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act;
 

 
•  the merger not being restrained, enjoined, rendered illegal or otherwise prohibited by any law or order of any

governmental authority;
 

 
•  the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as such term is defined in the section of this proxy statement

captioned “The Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties”);
 

 
•  the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Symantec and Acquisition Sub in the merger agreement, subject to

materiality qualifiers, as of the effective time of the merger or the date in respect of which such representation or
warranty was specifically made;

 

 

•  the accuracy of the representations and warranties of LifeLock in the merger agreement, as of the effective time of the
merger or the date in respect of which such representation or warranty was specifically made, except, in certain cases,
where the failure to be accurate has not and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect; and

 

 
•  the performance in all material respects by LifeLock, Symantec and Acquisition Sub of their respective covenants

required to be performed by them under the merger agreement at or prior to the effective time of the merger.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before or after the
adoption of the merger agreement by LifeLock stockholders, in the following ways:
 

 •  by mutual written agreement of LifeLock and Symantec;
 

 •  by either LifeLock or Symantec if:
 

 

•  (1) any permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other
legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the merger will be in effect, or any
action has been taken by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction that, in each case, prohibits, makes
illegal or enjoins the consummation of the merger and has become final and non-appealable; or (2) any statute,
law (including common law), ordinance, rule, regulation or stock exchange listing requirement is enacted,
entered, enforced or deemed applicable to the merger that prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation of
the merger;

•  the merger has not been consummated by 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on April 30, 2017, which we refer to as the
“termination date,” except that (1) if as of the termination date, all conditions to the merger agreement are
satisfied (other than those conditions to be satisfied at the time of the closing of the merger) or waived (where
permissible pursuant to applicable law), other than the closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement
relating to the expiration or termination of the U.S. antitrust waiting period or relating to no injunctions, laws, or
other judgments or orders or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the merger or making it
illegal, then either LifeLock or Symantec may elect by written notice to the other party to extend the termination
date until 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on August 21, 2017; or (2) if as of the termination date, Symantec has not
received specified financial information (as such term is defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger Agreement—Financing Cooperation”) or such specified financial information is not compliant (as
such term is defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Financing
Cooperation”) and Symantec is therefore not obligated to consummate the closing until five business days after
the date that Symantec has received such specified financial information, then LifeLock, by written notice to
Symantec, may extend the termination date until 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on the date that is five business days
after the completion of the five business day period set forth above, but in no event later than 11:59 p.m., Pacific
time, on August 21, 2017 (and such date and time shall thereafter constitute the termination date);

 

 

•  the special meeting has been held and the LifeLock stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement (except that
the right to terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this provision will not be available to any party whose
action or failure to act (which action or failure to act constitutes a breach by such party of the merger agreement)
has been the primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, the failure to obtain the approval of the LifeLock
stockholders at the special meeting);

 

 •  by LifeLock if:
 

 
•  after a cure period, Symantec or Acquisition Sub has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of

its respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in the merger agreement, such that the
related closing condition would not be satisfied;

 

 

•  prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by LifeLock stockholders if (1) LifeLock has received a superior
proposal; (2) the LifeLock Board (or a committee thereof) has authorized LifeLock to enter into an alternative
acquisition agreement to consummate the acquisition transaction contemplated by such superior proposal;
(3) prior to or concurrently with such termination, LifeLock has paid to Symantec an $87.5 million termination
fee; and (4) LifeLock has complied in all material respects with its non-solicitation, change in board
recommendation and related obligations under the merger agreement with respect to such superior proposal;

 

 •  by Symantec if:
 

 
•  after a cure period, LifeLock has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations,

warranties, covenants or other agreements in the merger agreement, such that the related closing condition would
not be satisfied; or

 

 •  the LifeLock Board has effected a company board recommendation change.

Termination Fees and Expense Reimbursement

Whether or not the merger is completed, LifeLock, on the one hand, and Symantec and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand,
are each generally responsible for all of their respective costs and expenses.

LifeLock will be required to pay to Symantec a termination fee of $87.5 million if the merger agreement is terminated under
specified circumstances. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—
Termination Fees.”

The Support Agreement

In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, three of our directors, Hilary Schneider, our President and Chief
Executive Officer, Todd Davis, our Executive Vice Chairman, and David Cowan, a beneficial owner of more than 5% of our
common stock, and Bessemer Venture Partners, one of our larger stockholders, which stockholder is affiliated with David Cowan,
have agreed to vote the shares of our common stock over which he, she or it exercises voting control for the adoption of the merger
agreement and the other proposals set forth in this proxy statement. We refer to these persons as the “supporting stockholders.” At
the close of business on December 21, 2016, the record date of the special meeting, the supporting stockholders collectively owned
or controlled 7,269,391 shares of common stock, which represented 7.7% of all outstanding shares of common stock on the record
date. The support agreement terminates on the earlier of the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms and
the effective time of the merger. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Support
Agreement.” The support agreement is also attached as Annex D to this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the support
agreement, which is the legal document that governs the obligations of the supporting stockholders, carefully and in its entirety.

Current Price of Common Stock

On December 22, 2016, the latest practicable trading day before the printing of this proxy statement, the closing price for the
common stock on NYSE was $23.86 per share. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for our common stock.

You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the instructions under
the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”

 
Q: Why am I receiving these materials?
 

A: On November 20, 2016, LifeLock entered into the merger agreement with Symantec and Acquisition Sub. Under the merger
agreement, Symantec will acquire LifeLock for $24.00 per share in cash. In order to complete the merger, LifeLock stockholders
must vote to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting. We must receive stockholder approval to complete the merger.
For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of
the Merger.” The LifeLock Board is furnishing this proxy statement and form of proxy card to the holders of shares of common
stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies of LifeLock stockholders to be voted in favor of the merger proposal and other
matters to be voted on at the special meeting.

This proxy statement, which you should read carefully, contains important information about the merger, the merger agreement,
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and the special meeting. The enclosed materials allow you to submit
a proxy to vote your shares without attending the special meeting.

Your vote is very important. Even if you plan to attend the special meeting, we encourage you to submit a proxy as soon as
possible.

 
Q: What am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting?
 

A: You are being asked to vote on the following proposals:
 

 
•  to approve the adoption of the merger agreement pursuant to which Acquisition Sub will merge with and into LifeLock with

LifeLock continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Symantec;
 

 
•  to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are

insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and
 

 
•  to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, the compensation that will or may become payable by Symantec to our named

executive officers in connection with the merger.

 
Q: When and where is the special meeting?
 

A: The special meeting will take place on Thursday, January 26, 2017, at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati,

Q: May I attend the special meeting and vote in person?
 

A: Yes. Subject to the requirements described in this proxy statement, all LifeLock stockholders as of the close of business on the
record date may attend the special meeting and vote in person. LifeLock stockholders will need to present proof of ownership of
shares of common stock, such as a bank or brokerage account statement, and a form of personal identification to be admitted to
the special meeting. No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in
the special meeting.

If, as of the record date, you are a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name,” you may not vote your shares in person at the
special meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your
shares in person at the special meeting. Otherwise, you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your
shares in accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your bank,
broker or other nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the adoption of the merger agreement, without your
instructions.

Even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the special meeting we
encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy
electronically over the internet or by telephone. If you attend the special meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will
revoke any proxy previously submitted.

 
Q: What is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on LifeLock?
 

A: The proposed merger is the acquisition of LifeLock by Symantec. If the adoption of the merger agreement is approved by
LifeLock stockholders and the other closing conditions under the merger agreement are satisfied or waived, Acquisition Sub will
merge with and into LifeLock, with LifeLock continuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, LifeLock will
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Symantec, and our common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted
from the NYSE. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we may no longer file periodic
reports with the SEC.

 
Q: What will I receive if the merger is completed?
 

A: Upon completion of the merger, you will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration in cash, without interest and
less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of common stock that you own, unless you have neither voted in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement nor consented thereto in writing and have properly and validly exercised and perfected your
appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares. For example, if you own 100 shares of common stock, you will
receive $2,400 in cash in exchange for your shares of common stock, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

 
Q: How does the per share merger consideration compare to the market price of the common stock prior to the public

announcement of the merger agreement?
 

A: The per share merger consideration represents a premium of approximately 59.4% to the closing price of the common stock on
June 16, 2016, the last trading day prior to the public filing by Elliott Associates, L.P. and certain affiliates that they had
accumulated a significant minority interest in LifeLock.

 
Q: What do I need to do now?
 

A: We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we refer to in this
proxy statement carefully and consider how the merger affects you. Then, even if you expect to attend the special meeting, sign,
date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card

in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone, so that your
shares can be voted at the special meeting. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.

If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee for additional information on how to vote your shares.

 
Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now?
 

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to send your stock
certificates or surrender your book-entry shares to the paying agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares
of common stock represented by your stock certificates. Unless you are seeking appraisal, you should use the letter of transmittal
to exchange your stock certificates or book-entry shares for the cash payment to which you are entitled. Please do not send your
stock certificates with your proxy card.

 
Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the record date but before the special

meeting?
 

A: The record date for the special meeting is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the date the merger is expected to be
completed. If you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of common stock after the record date but before the special meeting,
unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise
transfer your shares and each of you notifies LifeLock in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to
receive the per share merger consideration, if the merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or otherwise transfer your
shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the special meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your
shares of common stock after the record date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the
accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone.

 
Q: How does the LifeLock Board recommend that I vote?
 

A: The LifeLock Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the
adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) “FOR” the approval, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger.

 
Q: Why am I being asked to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, compensation that will or may become payable by

LifeLock to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?
 

A: SEC rules require LifeLock to hold a non-binding, advisory vote regarding compensation that will or may become payable by
LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger. Approval of a non-binding, advisory vote regarding the
compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is not
required to complete the merger.

 
Q: What is the compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to its named executive officers in connection with

the merger for purposes of this advisory vote?
 

A: The compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is
certain compensation that is tied to or based on the merger and payable to

certain of LifeLock’s named executive officers upon the occurrence of the merger or the occurrence of certain events following or
in connection with the consummation of the merger, such as a termination of service under certain circumstances within a
designated time frame before or following the consummation of the merger. For more information, see the section of this proxy
statement captioned “Proposal 3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote on Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements.”

 
Q: What will happen if LifeLock stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock

to its named executive officers in connection with the merger?
 

A: Approval of the compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with
the merger is not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote to approve the compensation that will or may become payable
by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is an advisory vote and will not be binding on
LifeLock or Symantec. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by LifeLock stockholders and the merger is completed,
the compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger
will or may be paid to LifeLock’s named executive officers even if LifeLock stockholders do not approve such compensation.

 
Q: What happens if the merger is not completed?
 

A: If the merger agreement is not adopted by LifeLock stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, LifeLock
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, (1) LifeLock will remain an independent
public company; (2) our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act;
and (3) we will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. The impact of not completing the merger on LifeLock’s stock price
is not ascertainable, but LifeLock’s stock price could be impacted negatively if the merger is not completed.

Under specified circumstances, LifeLock will be required to pay Symantec a termination fee upon the termination of the merger
agreement, as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees.”

 
Q: What vote is required to adopt the merger agreement?
 

A: Approval of the adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote “FOR” the proposal by the holders of at least a
majority of the outstanding shares of common stock.

The failure of any LifeLock stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or by
telephone; or (3) vote in person by ballot at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the adoption of
the merger agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to
vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the adoption of the merger agreement. Abstentions will have
the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the adoption of the merger agreement.

 
Q: What vote is required to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or

appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the
special meeting and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, the compensation that will or may become payable by
LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger?

 

A: Approval of the adjournment of the special meeting, to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting
power of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the
proposal. Approval by non-binding,

represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. The advisory vote on the compensation that will
or may become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger is a vote separate and apart
from the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. Accordingly, a LifeLock stockholder may vote to approve the adoption of
the merger agreement and vote not to approve the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal, and vice versa.

The failure of any LifeLock stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card; (2) grant a proxy over the internet or by
telephone; or (3) vote in person by ballot at the special meeting will not have any effect on the adjournment of the special meeting
to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the special meeting or the approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may
become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger. If you hold your shares in “street
name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have any effect on the
adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting and the approval, by non-binding, advisory
vote, of compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the
merger. In all cases, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the adjournment of the special meeting to a later
date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement
at the time of the special meeting and the approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become
payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.

 
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
 

A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you
are considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” If you are a stockholder of record, this proxy
statement and your proxy card have been sent directly to you by or on behalf of LifeLock.

If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of common
stock held in “street name.” If you are a beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in “street name,” this proxy statement
has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the
stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your
shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited to attend the special meeting. However, because you are not
the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person by ballot at the special meeting unless you obtain a “legal
proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.

 
Q: How may I vote?
 

A: If you are a LifeLock stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of common stock are registered in your name with American
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:

 

 •  by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
 

 •  by visiting the internet address on your proxy card;
 

 •  by calling the toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) phone number on your proxy card; or
 

 •  by attending the special meeting and voting in person by ballot.

Table of Contents

A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of common
stock and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the internet or by
telephone. Although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the internet or by telephone, you
may incur costs such as internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.

Even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of common stock by
proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your
shares of common stock in person by ballot at the special meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present
at the special meeting and vote in person by ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or
other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if
such a service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the internet or by telephone. To vote over
the internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting
instruction form provided by your bank, broker or nominee. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not
vote your shares in person by ballot at the special meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other
nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.

 
Q: What is a proxy?
 

A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of common stock. The written
document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the special meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document
used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of common stock is called a “proxy card.” Hilary Schneider, our Chief Executive
Officer and President, Douglas Jeffries, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Administrative Officer, and Sharon Segev, our
Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, each with full powers of substitution and resubstitution, are the proxy
holders for the special meeting.

 
Q: If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
 

A: No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at
the special meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures
provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such
proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no
effect on the vote to adjourn the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting or to approve, by non-binding,
advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the
merger.

 
Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed and dated proxy card?
 

A: Yes. If you are a LifeLock stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at
the special meeting by:

 

 •  signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting;
 

 •  submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 

 •  delivering a written notice of revocation to our Secretary; or
 

 •  attending the special meeting and voting in person by ballot.

Table of Contents

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions
regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the special meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your
bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the special meeting.

 
Q: If a LifeLock stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
 

A: Regardless of the method you choose to grant a proxy to vote your shares, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will
vote your shares in the way that you direct.

If you sign and date your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares
represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the
adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) “FOR” the approval, on a non-
binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in
connection with the merger.

 
Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 

A: Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone) each proxy card and voting
instruction form that you receive to ensure that all of your shares are voted.

You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy
cards or voting instruction cards, if your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account. For example, if
you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction form for each brokerage
account in which you hold shares. If you are a LifeLock stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one
name, you will receive more than one proxy card. Please vote all voting materials that you receive. 

 
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting?
 

A: If available, LifeLock may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the special meeting. LifeLock intends to
publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports
that LifeLock files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”

 
Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger?
 

A: If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which generally will require a U.S. Holder to recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S. Holder in the merger
and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common stock surrendered in the merger.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common
stock for cash in the merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

Because particular circumstances may differ, we recommend that you consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal
income tax consequences relating to the merger in light of your own particular

circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or foreign
taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger is provided in
the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

 
Q: What will the holders of LifeLock stock options and RSUs who are non-employee directors receive in the merger?
 

A: At the effective time of the merger, each director option and each director RSU, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately before the effective time of the merger will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive cash
amount(s), without interest and subject to any required tax withholdings, determined as the total number of shares of common
stock subject to the director option or director RSU, as applicable, multiplied by, with respect to director RSUs, $24.00, or with
respect to director options, the excess, if any, of $24.00 over the director option’s per share exercise price.

 
Q: What will the holders of LifeLock stock options and RSUs (other than non-employee directors) receive in the merger?
 

A: At the effective time of the merger, each vested option and vested RSU that is outstanding immediately before the effective time
of the merger will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive cash amount(s), without interest and subject
to any required tax withholdings, determined as the number of shares of common stock subject to the vested option or vested
RSU, as applicable, multiplied by, with respect to vested RSUs, $24.00, or with respect to vested options, the excess, if any, of
$24.00 over the vested option’s per share exercise price.

At the effective time of the merger, each unvested option and unvested RSU, that is outstanding immediately before and at the
effective time of the merger and held by a LifeLock service provider other than a non-employee director at the effective time of
the merger, will be assumed by Symantec and automatically converted into an option or restricted stock unit award, respectively,
representing the right to acquire, on the same terms and conditions applicable to such unvested option or unvested RSU
immediately before the effective time of the merger, shares of Symantec common stock, except as follows. The number of shares
of Symantec common stock subject to the assumed option or assumed RSU will be determined as the number of shares of
common stock that were subject to the unvested option or unvested RSU immediately before the effective time of the merger,
multiplied by the exchange ratio, with the resulting number rounded down to the nearest whole share. The per share exercise price
for each assumed option will equal the per share exercise price for the unvested option immediately before the effective time of
the merger, divided by the exchange ratio and rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The assumed options and assumed RSUs also
remain subject to any applicable provisions under the LifeLock Stock Plan under which the award was granted or any stock
option, restricted stock unit, employment, change of control, or other plan or agreement between the holder of the assumed option
or assumed RSU, as applicable, and LifeLock.

 
Q: What will the holders of LifeLock restricted stock awards receive in the merger?
 

A: At the effective time of the merger, each share of common stock subject to an RSA will be cancelled and automatically converted
into the right to receive a cash amount, without interest and subject to any required tax withholdings, equal to $24.00. The cash
payment will be retained by Symantec and will become payable only upon the occurrence of the date that such RSAs would have
become vested under the original vesting schedule in place immediately before or at the effective time of the merger for such RSA
(subject to the restrictions and other terms of such vesting schedule and giving effect to any applicable agreement between the
holder of the RSAs and Symantec).

Table of Contents

Q: What will a holder of LifeLock PRSAs receive in the merger?
 

A: At the effective time of the merger, each PRSA will be treated in accordance with the Notice of Grant of Performance-Based
Restricted Stock Award and the Performance-Based Restricted Stock Agreement governing the PRSA and any employment,
change of control, or other plan or agreement between the holder of the PRSA and LifeLock. Each share of common stock subject
to the PRSA that remains unvested and outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger will be treated in the
same manner as RSAs, as described in the immediately preceding paragraph above. Additional terms applicable to the PRSAs are
described under the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards.”

 
Q: What will happen to the ESPP?
 

A: Subject to the consummation of the merger, the ESPP will terminate as of effective time of the merger. No new purchase period or
offer period will begin under the ESPP after the date of the merger agreement. The merger agreement requires that participation in
the ESPP be limited to those employees who were participants in the ESPP on the date of the merger agreement and that each
individual participating in the purchase period in progress on the date of the merger agreement is not permitted to increase his or
her payroll contribution rate (or make separate non-payroll contributions that would have the effect of providing such increase)
pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in effect immediately before the date of the merger agreement, unless required by law. Any
purchase period under the ESPP that otherwise would be outstanding as of the effective time of the merger will be terminated no
later than one business day before the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs and any adjustments that may be
necessary or advisable to reflect this shortened purchase period will be made, but otherwise this shortened purchase period will be
treated as a fully effective and completed purchase period for all purposes under the ESPP. Any purchase right that is outstanding
under the ESPP will be exercised no later than one business day before the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs
and shares purchased under the ESPP generally will be treated in the same manner as other shares of common stock in the merger,
which generally means that the shares will be converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration in cash,
without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of common stock that you own, unless you have neither
voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement nor consented thereto in writing and have properly and validly exercised
and perfected your appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares.

 
Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?
 

A: We currently expect to complete the merger during the first calendar quarter of 2017. However, the exact timing of completion of
the merger, if it is completed at all, cannot be predicted because the merger is subject to the closing conditions specified in the
merger agreement, many of which are outside of our control. The merger agreement provides that the earliest that Symantec is
required to consummate the closing is January 31, 2017, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all the closing conditions. In
addition, if Symantec has not received specified financial information prior to the closing or if such specified financial
information is not compliant, Symantec is not obligated to consummate the closing until five business days after the date
Symantec receives such specified financial information. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger Agreement—Closing and Effective Time of the Merger.”

 
Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL?
 

A: Yes. If the merger is consummated, LifeLock stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who
continuously hold such shares through the effective time of the merger, who properly perfect appraisal of their shares and who
meet certain other conditions and statutory requirements described herein will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the
merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of shares of common stock may be entitled to have their shares
appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of common stock,
exclusive of any elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger,

together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court (subject, in the case
of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by LifeLock pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL,
as described in more detail below). LifeLock stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any case encouraged
to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the appraisal process.
The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant
section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement.

 
Q: Do any of LifeLock’s directors or officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of LifeLock stockholders

generally?
 

A: Yes. In considering the recommendation of the LifeLock Board with respect to the adoption of the merger agreement, you should
be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the
interests of LifeLock stockholders generally. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement; (2) approving the merger
agreement and the merger; and (3) recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by LifeLock stockholders, the LifeLock
Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. For more
information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger.”

 
Q: Who can help answer my questions?
 

A: If you have any questions concerning the merger, the special meeting or this proxy statement, would like additional copies of this
proxy statement or need help voting your shares of common stock, please contact our proxy solicitor:

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This proxy statement, the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement and information included in oral statements or
other written statements made or to be made by us or on our behalf contain “forward-looking statements” that do not directly or
exclusively relate to historical facts. You can typically identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking words, such
as “may,” “should,” “could,” “project,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “continue,” “potential,” “plan,” “forecast” and
other words of similar import. LifeLock stockholders are cautioned that any forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may vary materially from those in the forward-
looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks detailed in our filings with the SEC, including
in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, factors and matters described or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement,
and the following factors:
 

 
•  the inability to complete the merger due to the failure of LifeLock stockholders to adopt the merger agreement or failure to

satisfy the other conditions to the completion of the merger, including receipt of required regulatory approvals;
 

 
•  the risk that the merger agreement may be terminated in circumstances that require us to pay Symantec a termination fee of

$87.5 million;
 

 •  the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us and others related to the merger agreement;
 

 •  risks that the proposed merger affects our ability to retain or recruit employees;
 

 
•  the fact that receipt of the all-cash merger consideration would be taxable to LifeLock stockholders that are treated as U.S.

holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 
•  the fact that, if the merger is completed, LifeLock stockholders will forego the opportunity to realize the potential long-term

value of the successful execution of LifeLock’s current strategy as an independent company;
 

 
•  the possibility that Symantec could, at a later date, engage in unspecified transactions, including restructuring efforts, special

dividends or the sale of some or all of LifeLock’s assets to one or more as yet unknown purchasers, that could conceivably
produce a higher aggregate value than that available to LifeLock stockholders in the merger;

 

 
•  the fact that under the terms of the merger agreement, LifeLock is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals during the

pendency of the merger;
 

 
•  the effect of the announcement or pendency of the merger on our business relationships, operating results and business

generally, including risks related to the diversion of the attention of LifeLock management or employees during the
pendency of the merger;

 

 •  the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the merger agreement or the merger;
 

 •  the risk that our stock price may decline significantly if the merger is not completed;
 

 
•  risks related to obtaining the requisite consents to the merger, including the timing and receipt of U.S. regulatory approval

(including any conditions, limitations or restrictions placed in connection with such approval) and the risk that such approval
may not be obtained or receipt of such approval may be delayed; and

 

 •  the risk that our financial results differ from those set forth in the projections described in this proxy statement.

Consequently, all of the forward-looking statements that we make in this proxy statement are qualified by the information
contained or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, including (1) the information

Except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a

THE SPECIAL MEETING

The enclosed proxy card and this proxy statement are being furnished to LifeLock stockholders as part of the solicitation of
proxies on behalf of the LifeLock Board for use at the special meeting.

Date, Time and Place

We will hold the special meeting on Thursday, January 26, 2017, at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional
Corporation, located at 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California 94304, at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time.

LifeLock stockholders who plan to attend the special meeting will need to present proof of ownership of shares of common stock,
such as a bank or brokerage account statement, and a form of personal identification to be admitted to the special meeting. No cameras,
recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in the special meeting.

Purpose of the Special Meeting

At the special meeting, we will ask LifeLock stockholders to vote on proposals to (1) adopt the merger agreement; (2) adjourn the
special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at
the time of the special meeting; and (3) approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by
LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum

Only LifeLock stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 21, 2016, the record date of the special meeting,
are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. A list of LifeLock stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will
be available at our principal executive offices located at 60 East Rio Salado Parkway, Suite 400, Tempe, Arizona 85281, during regular
business hours for a period of no less than 10 days before the special meeting and at the place of the special meeting during the
meeting.

As of the record date, there were 94,947,772 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.

The presence at the special meeting in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the
common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote will constitute a quorum at the special meeting. In the event that a quorum is
not present at the special meeting, it is expected that the meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.

Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock is required to adopt the
merger agreement. Approval of the adjournment of the special meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative
vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting
and entitled to vote on the proposal. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable by
LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power
of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.

If a LifeLock stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST”
the adoption of the merger agreement. For LifeLock stockholders who attend the meeting or are represented by proxy and vote to
abstain, the abstention will have the same effect as if the

stockholder voted “AGAINST” the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting and “AGAINST” the
approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named executive
officers in connection with the merger.

Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the adoption of the merger agreement, but will have no effect on
the vote on (1) the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; or (2) the approval, by non-binding,
advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the
merger. A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a
proposal because the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the
shares. We do not expect any “broker non-votes,” at the special meeting, but if there are any, they will be counted for the purpose of
determining whether a quorum is present.

Shares Held by LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers

As of the record date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
2,040,516 shares of common stock, representing approximately 2.1% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the record date. In
addition, one of our directors, David Cowan, is affiliated with Bessemer Venture Partners, one of our larger stockholders, who
beneficially owns as of the record date 5,540,485 shares of common stock, representing approximately 5.8% of the shares of common
stock outstanding as of the record date. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote all of
their shares of common stock (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting to a
later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement
at the time of the special meeting; and (3) “FOR” the approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may
become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger. Certain of our directors and executive
officers as well as Bessemer Venture Partners have entered into a support agreement whereby they have each agreed to vote their
shares in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the other proposals set forth in this proxy statement. For more information,
see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Support Agreement.”

Voting of Proxies

If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you may
cause your shares to be voted by returning a signed and dated proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope, or you may vote
in person by ballot at the special meeting. Additionally, you may grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone by
following the instructions on your proxy card. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the instructions on the
proxy card, in order to grant a proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone. Based on your proxy cards or internet and
telephone proxies, the proxy holders will vote your shares according to your directions.

If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the special meeting. If your
shares are registered in your name, you are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person. If you
attend the special meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.

All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received in time for the special meeting will be voted at the special
meeting in accordance with the instructions of the LifeLock stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting
instructions will be voted (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting to a
later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement
at the time of the special

meeting; and (3) “FOR” the approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock
to our named executive officers in connection with the merger.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or
other nominee by completing and returning the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or attending
the special meeting and voting in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote
your shares in person at the special meeting. If such a service is provided, you may vote over the internet or telephone through your
bank, broker or other nominee by following the instructions on the voting instruction form provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee. If you do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting instruction form, do not vote over the internet or by
telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if possible, or do not attend the special meeting and vote in person with a “legal
proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee, it will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the adoption of the merger
agreement but will not have any effect on the vote to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting or the vote to approve, by non-
binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with
the merger.

Adjournment

In addition to the proposals to (1) adopt the merger agreement; and (2) approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, compensation
that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, LifeLock stockholders
are also being asked to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional votes or proxies in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special
meeting to approve the merger agreement. If a quorum is not present or represented, the chairperson of the special meeting or the
LifeLock stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, may adjourn the special
meeting, from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented. In
addition, the special meeting could be postponed before it commences, subject to the terms of the merger agreement. If the special
meeting is adjourned or postponed, LifeLock stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any
time prior to the final vote on the proposals.

Revocability of Proxies

If you are a LifeLock stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the
special meeting by:
 

 •  signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the special meeting;
 

 •  submitting a new proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 

 •  delivering a written notice of revocation to our Secretary; or
 

 •  attending the special meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you have submitted a proxy, your appearance at the special meeting, in the absence of voting in person or submitting an
additional proxy or revocation, will not have the effect of revoking your prior proxy.

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions
regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the special meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank,
broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares in person at the special meeting.

Table of Contents

Any adjournment, postponement or other delay of the special meeting, including for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies,
will allow LifeLock stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the special
meeting as adjourned, postponed or delayed.

The LifeLock Board’s Recommendation

The LifeLock Board, after considering various factors described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—
Recommendation of the LifeLock Board and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously (1) determined that it is in the best interests of
LifeLock and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement and consummate the merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement; (2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement
by LifeLock, the performance by LifeLock of its covenants and other obligations in the merger agreement, and the consummation of
the merger upon the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement; (3) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be
submitted to a vote at the special meeting; and (4) resolved to recommend that the LifeLock stockholders vote in favor of the adoption
of the merger agreement in accordance with the DGCL. The LifeLock Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the
adoption of the merger agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting;
and (3) “FOR” the approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger.

Solicitation of Proxies

The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by LifeLock. We have retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated, a professional proxy
solicitation firm, to solicit proxies in connection with the special meeting at a cost of approximately $20,000 plus expenses. We will
also indemnify Innisfree M&A Incorporated against losses arising out of its provisions of these services on our behalf. In addition, we
may reimburse banks, brokers and other nominees representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting
materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by our directors, officers and employees, personally or by telephone,
email, fax or over the internet. No additional compensation will be paid for such services. In some instances, Symantec may be deemed
to be a participant in the solicitation of proxies.

Anticipated Date of Completion of the Merger

We currently expect to complete the merger during the first calendar quarter of 2017. The merger agreement provides that the
earliest that Symantec is required to consummate the closing is January 31, 2017, subject to satisfaction and waiver of all of the closing
conditions in the merger agreement. However, the exact timing of completion of the merger cannot be predicted because the merger is
subject to the closing conditions specified in the merger agreement, many of which are outside of our control. Even if all other closing
conditions are satisfied or waived, if Symantec has not received specified financial information prior to the closing or if such specified
financial information is not compliant (as such terms are defined in this section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
Agreement—Financing Cooperation”), Symantec is not obligated to consummate the closing until five business days after the date
Symantec receives such specified financial information. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger Agreement—Closing and Effective Time of the Merger” and the section captioned “The Merger Agreement—Financing
Cooperation.”

Appraisal Rights

If the merger is consummated, LifeLock stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who
continuously hold such shares through the effective time of the merger, who properly exercise and perfect appraisal of their shares and
who meet certain other conditions and statutory requirements described herein will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the
merger under Section 262 of the DGCL. This means that holders of shares of common stock may be entitled to have their shares
appraised by the Delaware

Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of common stock, exclusive of any elements of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be
fair value, if any, as determined by the court (subject, in the case of interest payments, to any voluntary cash payments made by
LifeLock pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL, as described in more detail below), so long as they comply with the
procedures established by Section 262 of the DGCL. Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, LifeLock stockholders who wish
to seek appraisal of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights.

LifeLock stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the consideration that they
would receive pursuant to the merger agreement if they did not seek appraisal of their shares.

To exercise your appraisal rights, you must (1) submit a written demand for appraisal to LifeLock before the vote is taken on the
adoption of the merger agreement; (2) not vote, in person or by proxy, in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; and
(3) continue to hold your shares of common stock of record through the effective time of the merger. Your failure to follow exactly the
procedures specified under the DGCL may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal
rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement, and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal rights is
reproduced and attached as Annex C to this proxy statement. If you hold your shares of common stock through a bank, brokerage firm
or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to
determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such bank, brokerage firm or nominee.

Other Matters

At this time, we know of no other matters to be voted on at the special meeting. If any other matters properly come before the
special meeting, your shares of common stock will be voted in accordance with the discretion of the appointed proxy holders.

Householding of Special Meeting Materials

We have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called “householding.” Under this procedure, LifeLock stockholders who
have the same address and last name will receive only one copy of this proxy statement unless one or more of these stockholders
notifies us that they wish to continue receiving individual copies. This procedure reduces printing costs, postage fees and the use of
natural resources. Each LifeLock stockholder who participates in householding will continue to be able to access or receive a separate
proxy card.

If you wish to receive a separate set of our disclosure documents at this time, contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. by
telephone at 866-540-7095 (inside or outside of the U.S.), or by writing to Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., Householding
Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717. If you wish to receive a separate set of our disclosure documents in the
future, you may contact Investor Relations, LifeLock, Inc. 60 East Rio Salado Parkway, Suite 400, Tempe, Arizona 85281.

If you are a LifeLock stockholder who has multiple accounts in your name or you share an address with other LifeLock
stockholders and would like to receive a single set of our disclosure documents for your household, you may notify your broker, if your
shares are held in a brokerage account, or if you hold registered shares, by notifying either LifeLock Investor Relations or Broadridge
using the contact methods above.

This discussion of the merger is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which is attached as Annex A to

Symantec’s common stock is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “SYMC.”

L1116 Merger Sub, Inc.
c/o Symantec Corporation
350 Ellis St.
Mountain View, California 94043
(650) 527-8000

Acquisition Sub is a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Symantec and was formed on November 17, 2016, solely for the purpose

Relationship Between LifeLock and Symantec

In the ordinary course of business, LifeLock and Symantec have entered into the following agreements and arrangements:
 

 
•  On December 15, 2012, LifeLock entered into a Cloud Services Agreement with Symantec, which we refer to as the

“Services Agreement.” Under the Services Agreement, Symantec provides certain cloud

services to LifeLock. The term of the Services Agreement is for 36 months from the effective date of the Services
Agreement and provides for automatic renewal for additional 12 month periods until either party provides the other with
written notification of non-renewal.

 

 

•  On October 21, 2016, LifeLock entered into a partner Marketing Test Agreement with Symantec, which we refer to as the
“Marketing Agreement.” Under the Marketing Agreement, LifeLock appointed Symantec as a reseller of certain of its
solutions to offer with Symantec’s offering and co-marketed on Symantec’s website pursuant to a limited time test. The
Marketing Agreement is effective until such time as either party provides the other party 24 hour prior written notice of
termination.

Effect of the Merger

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, Acquisition Sub will merge with and into LifeLock, with
LifeLock continuing as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, LifeLock will continue as the surviving corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Symantec, and our common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the NYSE. In
addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we may no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If
the merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation.

The effective time of the merger will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (or at such later time as we, Symantec and Acquisition Sub may agree in writing and specify in such certificate of merger).

Effect on LifeLock if the Merger is Not Completed

If the merger agreement is not adopted by LifeLock stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, LifeLock
stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, LifeLock will remain an independent public
company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE and registered under the Exchange Act and we will
continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the merger is not completed, we expect that management will operate the
business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that LifeLock stockholders will continue to be subject to the
same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to the highly competitive industry in which
LifeLock operates, volatility of the stock price, evolving regulatory environment and adverse economic conditions.

Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that caused the merger not to be completed, the
price of our common stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock
would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

Accordingly, if the merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the
future value of your shares of common stock. If the merger is not completed, the LifeLock Board will continue to evaluate and review,
among other things, LifeLock’s business operations, strategic direction and capitalization, and will make whatever changes it deems
appropriate. If the merger agreement is not adopted by LifeLock stockholders or if the merger is not completed for any other reason,
LifeLock’s business, prospects or results of operation may be adversely impacted.

Under specified circumstances, LifeLock will be required to pay Symantec a termination fee of $87.5 million upon the
termination of the merger agreement. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement
—Termination Fees.”

Merger Consideration

In the merger, each outstanding share of common stock (other than shares held by (1) LifeLock as treasury stock; (2) Symantec or
Acquisition Sub; (3) any subsidiary of LifeLock, Symantec or Acquisition Sub; and

(4) LifeLock stockholders who have neither voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement nor consented thereto in writing
and have properly and validly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) will be
cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration.

After the merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the per share merger consideration, as described in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Conversion of Shares,” but you will no longer have any rights as a LifeLock
stockholder (except that LifeLock stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for
the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by the DGCL, as described in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “—Appraisal Rights”).

Background of the Merger

The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger agreement. This
chronology does not purport to catalogue every conversation among the Strategic Committee (as defined below), the LifeLock Board
or the representatives of LifeLock, and other parties.

The LifeLock Board regularly evaluates LifeLock’s strategic direction and ongoing business plans with a view toward
strengthening its core businesses and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the LifeLock Board has from time to
time considered a variety of strategic alternatives, including (1) the continuation of LifeLock’s current business plan as a standalone
entity; (2) modifications to LifeLock’s business plan and strategy; (3) repurchases of common stock and other financing alternatives;
(4) potential expansion opportunities into new business lines through acquisitions and combinations of LifeLock with other businesses;
and (5) other strategic alternatives.

In the second half of 2015, LifeLock’s common stock price was subject to significant volatility after a July 21, 2015
announcement of allegations by the Federal Trade Commission, which we refer to as the “FTC,” of contempt in relation to a prior
consent decree LifeLock entered into with the FTC. On December 17, 2015, LifeLock announced that it entered into a comprehensive
settlement of these claims with the FTC and a settlement of related consumer class action lawsuits. Also in late 2015, LifeLock
announced its intention to repurchase up to $100 million of its common stock by the end of 2016, which was executed from February
2016 through May 2016, including through the use of two accelerated share repurchase agreements. LifeLock’s closing stock price was
$16.06 on the day prior to the announcement of the FTC allegations, LifeLock’s closing stock price was $8.15 on the day following the
announcement of the FTC allegations, and LifeLock’s closing stock price on the day of and prior to the filing of Elliott’s Schedule 13D
after the close of market, as described below, was $15.06. During the period following the FTC allegations, LifeLock received
occasional unsolicited communications from financial sponsors seeking to ascertain whether LifeLock would be interested in entering
into discussions concerning strategic alternatives with them, was considering or would consider a going private strategic transaction,
and expressing interest in participating in discussions if it was a path that LifeLock wanted to explore. None of these unsolicited
inquiries resulted in the exchange of confidential information to facilitate such discussions at the time.

On June 16, 2016, Elliott Associates, L.P. and certain affiliated investment funds, which we refer to collectively as “Elliott,” filed
a Schedule 13D disclosing that Elliott had acquired beneficial ownership of 7.6% of LifeLock common stock, as well as a position in
derivative instruments increasing Elliott’s economic exposure in our by an additional 1.2% of our common stock. Elliott’s Schedule
13D stated that Elliott (1) believed that our common stock was undervalued relative to the price before LifeLock had announced an
accelerated share repurchase program in May 2016, and (2) had initiated a dialogue with LifeLock management and the LifeLock
Board on opportunities to enhance stockholder value. Prior to Elliott filing its Schedule 13D, a representative of Elliott called
LifeLock’s Chief Executive Officer and President, Hilary Schneider, and informed her that Elliott was about to make its Schedule 13D
filing and requested a meeting with the LifeLock Board and LifeLock management.

On June 16, 2016, in light of Elliott’s Schedule 13D filing, representatives of LifeLock management contacted Goldman Sachs.
Goldman Sachs acted as the lead underwriter in LifeLock’s initial public offering and from time to time advised LifeLock on other
strategic matters. Around this time, LifeLock also contacted another investment bank concerning Elliott’s Schedule 13D filing, but did
not retain that investment bank. A representative of LifeLock also contacted Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional
Corporation, outside legal counsel to LifeLock, which we refer to as “Wilson Sonsini,” to provide legal advice in connection with
Elliott’s Schedule 13D filing.

On June 24, 2016, Ms. Schneider, Chris Power, LifeLock’s then Chief Financial Officer, Douglas Jeffries, LifeLock’s then Chief
Administrative Officer and current Chief Financial Officer, and another member of LifeLock management met with representatives of
Elliott and a private equity fund affiliated with Elliott. Elliott and this affiliated private equity fund are together referred to as “Sponsor
A.” The representatives of Sponsor A stated that Sponsor A might be interested in exploring a potential strategic transaction with
LifeLock and requested that LifeLock enter into a confidentiality agreement with customary protections for LifeLock.

Following Elliott’s Schedule 13D filing, LifeLock and its representatives received additional (and in some cases, renewed)
unsolicited communications from various financial sponsors regarding LifeLock’s interest in exploring a potential acquisition
transaction.

On June 27, 2016, the LifeLock Board met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman Sachs, and Wilson
Sonsini in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the LifeLock Board their fiduciary duties.
The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed with the members of the LifeLock Board market perspectives on LifeLock’s
valuation, information on Elliott and potential responses to Elliott. These potential responses included engagement with Sponsor A or
Elliott individually, initiation of a value discovery process or continuing to operate LifeLock’s business on a standalone basis. The
members of the LifeLock Board discussed the potential engagement of a financial advisor. The LifeLock Board reviewed Goldman
Sachs’ expertise, its familiarity with LifeLock’s business and the overall industry and Elliott, and LifeLock’s prior experience with
Goldman Sachs. Following review of potential financial advisors, the LifeLock Board approved the engagement of Goldman Sachs and
authorized LifeLock management to enter into an engagement letter with Goldman Sachs on the terms presented to the LifeLock
Board.

On June 28, 2016, Elliott sent a letter to the LifeLock Board providing background on Elliott. The letter also provided Elliott’s
views regarding LifeLock’s performance as a public company and the advantages that Elliott perceived in LifeLock operating as a
private company. Also on June 28, 2016, Elliott filed an amendment to its Schedule 13D disclosing that its beneficial ownership was
7.6% of LifeLock common stock, and a position in derivative instruments increasing its economic exposure in LifeLock by an
additional 2.3% of LifeLock common stock.

On July 5, 2016, a significant LifeLock stockholder contacted a representative of LifeLock management and requested a
conversation with LifeLock management and an independent member of the LifeLock Board to discuss the stockholder’s perspective
on LifeLock, as well as the long-term views of LifeLock management and the LifeLock Board. On July 6, 2016, Ms. Schneider and
Roy Guthrie, an independent director and the Chairman of the LifeLock Board, spoke with this stockholder. During this conversation,
the stockholder stated that it would be in favor of LifeLock exploring a potential sale transaction. In June and July 2016,
representatives of LifeLock management also held conversations with several other major LifeLock stockholders to discuss their
reactions with respect to the Elliott Schedule 13D filings; in response, some of these major stockholders stated they would be open to a
sale of LifeLock on appropriate terms.

On July 13, 2016, LifeLock formally engaged Goldman Sachs to assist LifeLock with stockholder activism and, if requested by
the LifeLock Board, the exploration of strategic alternatives.

On July 14, 2016, the LifeLock Board met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman Sachs and Wilson
Sonsini in attendance. The LifeLock Board discussed Sponsor A’s interest in a potential

acquisition of LifeLock, as well as the other inquiries regarding a potential acquisition that LifeLock had received. The LifeLock Board
also reviewed the discussions with significant stockholders LifeLock that had taken place. Representatives of LifeLock management
reviewed their forecasts of LifeLock’s standalone plan and the key assumptions underlying the forecasts. These forecasts were prepared
as a part of LifeLock’s internal strategic planning review process; however, the timing of the process was accelerated in light of Elliott
filing its Schedule 13D. The LifeLock Board discussed alternatives available to LifeLock, including whether to conduct an accelerated
return of capital and whether to engage in a process to explore interest in a possible acquisition of LifeLock. The representatives of
Goldman Sachs provided a preliminary financial analysis of LifeLock and reviewed with the LifeLock Board potential strategic
acquirors and financial sponsors who might have an interest in acquiring LifeLock, should the LifeLock Board determine to explore a
sale. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the LifeLock Board their fiduciary duties. Following
discussion, the LifeLock Board determined that LifeLock should privately solicit interest in a potential acquisition from a group of
potential acquirors for a potential acquisition, which included both financial sponsors and strategic acquirors. The LifeLock Board
authorized Goldman Sachs, on behalf of LifeLock, to contact various parties identified by the LifeLock Board, with input from
Goldman Sachs, that might have an interest in acquiring LifeLock. These parties included Sponsor A and each of the substantial parties
that had previously expressed interest. The parties were selected based on the LifeLock Board’s review of numerous factors, including
financial and other factors impacting the ability to consummate an acquisition, interest in LifeLock’s business, and potential strategic
fit. After discussion with its advisors, the LifeLock Board determined that engagement with any party would be conditioned on
reaching an appropriate confidentiality agreement. In addition, in light of the potentially significant workload involved in exploring
strategic alternatives and the possibility that in connection with such exploration LifeLock management might need feedback and
direction on relatively short notice, the LifeLock Board created a strategic committee, which we refer to as the “Strategic
Committee.” The Strategic Committee was authorized to (1) advise and direct LifeLock management with respect to the exploration,
consideration and negotiation of strategic alternatives; (2) facilitate negotiation; and (3) report to the LifeLock Board on a regular basis.
The LifeLock Board retained authority to review, assess and approve any transaction. The LifeLock Board appointed Mr. Guthrie and
Albert “Rocky” Pimentel to the Strategic Committee. Mr. Guthrie and Mr. Pimentel were selected to be on the Strategic Committee
after considering their independence (including Mr. Guthrie’s status as independent Chairman of the LifeLock Board), business and
industry expertise, and experience in finance and acquisition matters.

On July 15, 2016, representatives of Goldman Sachs spoke with representatives of Sponsor A to further explore Sponsor A’s
interest in a possible acquisition of LifeLock. At the conclusion of the discussion, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Sponsor A
discussed having counsel to Sponsor A contact Wilson Sonsini to further discuss the terms of a confidentiality agreement. The
representatives of Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of LifeLock, conveyed to counsel to Sponsor A concerns regarding confidentiality and
Sponsor A’s use of LifeLock’s information.

On July 19, 2016, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman Sachs and
Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed with the representatives of Goldman Sachs the financial sponsors
and strategic acquirors identified as possibly having an interest in a potential acquisition of LifeLock. The Strategic Committee
authorized Wilson Sonsini to negotiate the terms of confidentiality agreements with the parties identified by the LifeLock Board at its
meeting on July 14, 2016, including Sponsor A.

As discussed below, beginning in late July 2016, and continuing through September 2016, representatives of Goldman Sachs
contacted a total of 30 potential strategic acquirors and 16 potential financial sponsors, which included each of the substantial financial
sponsors that had expressed interest regarding a potential acquisition of LifeLock both before and after the filing of the Schedule 13D
by Elliott. Of the parties contacted, two potential strategic acquirors, in addition to Symantec, and seven financial sponsors, in addition
to Sponsor A, ultimately executed confidentiality agreements with LifeLock. These confidentiality agreements contained customary
standstill provisions that restricted the potential acquirors from making unsolicited proposals to LifeLock

stockholders for a period of nine to 18 months. The standstill provisions did not restrict the potential acquirors from making
confidential proposals and requests to waive the standstill to the LifeLock Board. As discussed below, LifeLock ultimately received
acquisition proposals from five financial sponsors and Symantec.

On July 20, 2016, counsel to Sponsor A provided a draft of a confidentiality agreement to Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of LifeLock,
for review. After negotiation, LifeLock and Sponsor A signed the confidentiality agreement on August 13, 2016. The confidentiality
agreement contained customary restrictions on Sponsor A’s disclosure of LifeLock’s confidential information and use of LifeLock’s
information only for a transaction during the term of the agreement. The agreement did not contain an explicit standstill provision, but
provided that prior to January 20, 2017, LifeLock’s confidential information could only be used in connection with a negotiated
transaction.

On July 22, 2016, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman Sachs and
Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The Strategic Committee discussed inquiries received by LifeLock from financial sponsors regarding a
potential acquisition both before and after the filing of the Schedule 13D by Elliott. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed
with the Strategic Committee planned outreach to financial sponsors and strategic acquirors, including the substantial financial
sponsors that had previously expressed interest.

On July 29, 2016, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman Sachs and
Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed with the Strategic Committee the preliminary results of
outreach to certain financial sponsors and strategic acquirors identified as possibly having an interest in a potential transaction with
LifeLock. With input from the representatives of Goldman Sachs, the members of the Strategic Committee discussed other companies
that could potentially have an interest in an acquisition of LifeLock, should the LifeLock Board wish to expand the process.

On August 2, 2016, LifeLock announced its 2016 second quarter results.

On August 3, 2016 and August 4, 2016, the LifeLock Board met. For portions of these meetings, representatives of each of
LifeLock management, Goldman Sachs, Wilson Sonsini, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, which we refer to as
“Skadden,” were in attendance. LifeLock retained Skadden to act as special counsel to the LifeLock Board on stockholder activism and
the exploration of strategic alternatives. The representatives of Goldman Sachs updated the members of the LifeLock Board regarding
the ongoing outreach to financial sponsors and strategic acquirors identified as possibly having an interest in a potential transaction
with LifeLock. The representatives of Goldman Sachs also stated that Sponsor A was interested in working with another financial
sponsor, which we refer to as “Sponsor B,” with respect to a potential acquisition of LifeLock. Based on the LifeLock Board’s belief
that allowing Sponsor A to work with Sponsor B might enable them to present a stronger proposal than either could alone, the
LifeLock Board authorized entry into a confidentiality agreement with Sponsor B (and corresponding provisions in the confidentiality
agreement being negotiated with Sponsor A) that would permit Sponsor B to cooperate with Sponsor A in connection with a potential
acquisition of LifeLock. With the assistance of the representatives of Goldman Sachs, the members of the LifeLock Board reviewed
additional financial sponsors and strategic acquirors not previously contacted that might have an interest in an acquisition of LifeLock,
and approved contact with additional parties. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed next steps for exploring a potential
acquisition of LifeLock, including management meetings with potential acquirors. As part of LifeLock’s strategic planning process, the
LifeLock Board and LifeLock management reviewed in detail LifeLock’s standalone strategic and financial plan.

On August 5, 2016, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management and Goldman Sachs in
attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed with the member of the Strategic Committee the ongoing status of
discussions with financial sponsors and strategic acquirors interested in a potential acquisition of LifeLock.

On August 10, 2016, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management and Goldman Sachs in
attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed with the members of the Strategic Committee an update on the financial
sponsors and strategic acquirors that had indicated they were interested in continuing to participate in a process to explore a potential
acquisition of LifeLock.

On August 12, 2016, Elliott filed an amendment to its Schedule 13D to disclose that its beneficial ownership was 8.4% of
LifeLock common stock, and its position in derivative instruments increased its economic exposure in LifeLock to an additional 2.5%
of LifeLock common stock. This filing also stated that it had communicated with members of LifeLock management and had
encouraged LifeLock to undertake a strategic review process.

On August 17, 2016, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management and Goldman Sachs in
attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed with the members of the Strategic Committee the status of outreach to
parties that had indicated preliminary interest in pursuing a potential transaction. The members of the Strategic Committee considered
contacting additional strategic acquirors, and authorized Goldman Sachs to contact these strategic acquirors. The representatives of
Goldman Sachs then discussed the progress of entering into confidentiality agreements with financial sponsors and strategic acquirors
and the planned commencement of management meetings with the parties who had executed confidentiality agreements.

On August 19, 2016, Symantec informed Goldman Sachs that it was interested in exploring a potential acquisition of LifeLock,
and Goldman Sachs subsequently updated the Strategic Committee regarding this interest.

From August 29 to August 31, 2016, representatives of each of LifeLock management and Goldman Sachs met with
representatives of one strategic acquiror (that was not Symantec) and two financial sponsors to provide preliminary due diligence
information regarding LifeLock with respect to a potential acquisition. Additional meetings with strategic acquirors and financial
sponsors were scheduled for September 2016.

On August 31, 2016, representatives of Goldman Sachs provided Symantec with a draft of a confidentiality agreement. After
negotiation, the confidentiality agreement was executed by the parties on September 15, 2016. It contained a customary standstill
provision that restricted Symantec from making an unsolicited proposal to LifeLock stockholders for a period of 12 months. The
standstill provision did not restrict Symantec from making confidential proposals to the LifeLock Board.

Beginning in September 2016, LifeLock opened an online data room containing due diligence materials. Interested parties,
including Symantec, that entered into confidentiality agreements with LifeLock were provided access to the online data room, which
included the July Forecasts and October Revisions that are described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Financial
Forecasts.”

On September 2, 2016, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman Sachs,
Wilson Sonsini and Skadden in attendance. Ms. Schneider discussed the meetings that had been held with potential acquirors. The
representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed with the members of the Strategic Committee the status of outreach to parties that had
indicated preliminary interest in a potential transaction and recommended an expansion of outreach efforts to additional financial
sponsors and strategic acquirors identified as possibly having an interest in a potential transaction with LifeLock. The representatives
of Goldman Sachs also noted that Symantec had informed them of its interest in exploring a potential acquisition transaction with
LifeLock. The Strategic Committee authorized the representatives of Goldman Sachs to expand the outreach efforts as suggested.

Throughout September 2016, in addition to the meetings with two financial sponsors and one strategic acquiror that occurred in
August 2016, representatives of each of LifeLock management and Goldman Sachs met with representatives of each of Symantec and
two other strategic acquirors and six financial sponsors, including Sponsor A and Sponsor B together, to provide due diligence
information regarding LifeLock. The meeting with Symantec occurred on September 16, 2016.

On September 9, 2016, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman Sachs,
Wilson Sonsini and Skadden in attendance. Ms. Schneider and representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an update on the status of
potential acquisition discussions, including the parties that indicated they were declining to proceed with exploring a possible
acquisition, the parties that remained interested in a possible acquisition and the parties from whom LifeLock was still awaiting a
response. The members of the Strategic Committee discussed the overall timing for considering interest in a possible acquisition of
LifeLock, including the expectation that LifeLock would request that preliminary indications of interest be submitted during the first
week of October 2016.

On September 14, 2016, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman Sachs,

Between September 17 and September 26, 2016, Goldman Sachs delivered to the nine remaining interested parties a process letter
requesting that parties interested in exploring a transaction with LifeLock submit preliminary indications of interest by October 5,
2016.

On September 30, 2016, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman Sachs,
Wilson Sonsini and Skadden in attendance. Ms. Schneider provided the members of the Strategic Committee with an update on the
recent management meetings held with potential acquirors. The representatives of Goldman Sachs updated the members of the
Strategic Committee on the status of recent discussions and stated that parties interested in exploring a transaction with LifeLock had
been instructed to submit preliminary indications of interest by October 5, 2016. The members of the Strategic Committee discussed
with the representatives of Goldman Sachs various valuation metrics related to LifeLock on a standalone basis, along with other
strategic alternatives available to LifeLock.

On October 5, 2016, LifeLock received indications of interest from five financial sponsors: (1) Sponsor A and Sponsor B together
submitted a non-binding indication of interest to acquire LifeLock for a price between $20.00 to $22.00 in cash per share of common
stock; (2) a financial sponsor, which we refer to as “Sponsor C,” submitted a non-binding indication of interest to acquire LifeLock for
a price between $18.50 to $19.50 in cash per share of common stock; (3) a consortium of financial sponsors, which we refer to as
“Sponsor D,” submitted a non-binding indication of interest to acquire LifeLock for a price between $20.00 to $22.00 in cash per share

each of Goldman Sachs, Wilson Sonsini and Skadden potential next steps in the process. The representatives of Goldman Sachs noted
that Symantec had indicated that it expected to submit a preliminary indication of interest soon after the meeting. The representatives
of Goldman Sachs also noted that one of the strategic acquirors with whom LifeLock previously had discussions was not interested in
pursuing a potential acquisition of LifeLock, but remained interested in pursuing a potential commercial agreement. After further
discussion, the Strategic Committee concluded to revisit a potential commercial agreement with that strategic acquiror in the event that
the sale process did not result in an acquisition of LifeLock. The representatives of Goldman Sachs provided an overview of LifeLock
on a standalone basis and discussed a preliminary valuation analysis. Also on October 7, 2016, Sponsor F indicated that it was no
longer pursuing an acquisition of LifeLock, but would be interested in being part of a consortium led by another financial sponsor.

Later on October 7, 2016, Symantec submitted a non-binding indication of interest to acquire LifeLock for a price of $20.00 in
cash per share of common stock.

On October 10, 2016, the LifeLock Board met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman Sachs, Wilson
Sonsini and Skadden in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Skadden reviewed the fiduciary duties of the members
of the LifeLock Board. The representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed the process to date and the indications of interest received. The
members of the LifeLock Board discussed the indications of interest received and noted in particular that Sponsor C’s proposal was
below the other proposals. The LifeLock Board instructed the representatives of Goldman Sachs to inform Sponsor C that its proposal
was materially lower than the other proposals that had been received. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed a form of
proposed merger agreement to be distributed to financial sponsors, as well as changes to the proposed form of merger agreement to be
distributed to Symantec, as a strategic acquiror. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Goldman Sachs discussed the customary
transaction structures for financial sponsors and strategic acquirors, including the differences between them, particularly in relation to
financing and potential effects on certainty of closing. The representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the LifeLock Board an
overview of LifeLock on a standalone basis and discussed a preliminary valuation analysis, including the Forecasts discussed in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “—Financial Forecasts.” The LifeLock Board authorized the distribution of draft merger
agreements to Sponsor A-Sponsor B, Sponsor C, Sponsor D, Sponsor E and Symantec.

Later on October 10, 2016, representatives of Goldman Sachs spoke with Sponsor C regarding the status of its indication of
interest. Sponsor C responded by increasing the price in its indication of interest to $20.00 in cash per share of common stock and
stating its desire to partner with Sponsor D going forward.

On October 14, 2016, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman Sachs,
Wilson Sonsini and Skadden in attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed the indications of interest that had been
received and the process to date. The representatives of Goldman Sachs also discussed that Sponsor C had increased its indication of
interest to $20.00 in cash per share of common stock and had asked to be paired with Sponsor D in order to continue to proceed with
the exploration of an acquisition of LifeLock. The representatives of Goldman Sachs also noted the possibility of pairing Sponsor E
and Sponsor F, given Sponsor F’s indication that it was no longer interested in pursuing a transaction by itself. The members of the
Strategic Committee discussed whether to allow the pairing of Sponsor C and Sponsor D and the pairing of Sponsor E and Sponsor F,
and determined that these pairings could enable the respective consortiums to potentially make stronger proposals. The Strategic
Committee requested that Goldman Sachs facilitate the pairings. The representatives of Goldman Sachs also reviewed with the
Strategic Committee the debt financing sources that had been disclosed by interested parties. The members of the Strategic Committee
discussed the anticipated timeline for soliciting final proposals from the participating parties. Following the meeting, Sponsor F
partnered with Sponsor E to evaluate a potential acquisition transaction with LifeLock going forward.

On October 14, October 17, and October 25, 2016, representatives of each of LifeLock management, including Ms. Schneider
and Mr. Jeffries, and Goldman Sachs met with representatives of each of Sponsor C and Sponsor D to allow Sponsor C and Sponsor D

On November 7, 2016, Goldman Sachs, on behalf of LifeLock, distributed second-round process letters to the three groups that
remained interested an acquisition of LifeLock, which were (1) Sponsor A and Sponsor B, (2) Sponsor C and Sponsor D, and (3)
Symantec. The letters called for final proposals by November 15, 2016. Interested parties were requested to submit revised drafts of a

On November 11, 2016, prior to the close of the NYSE, media sources reported that LifeLock was pursuing a potential sale. That
day, LifeLock’s closing stock price was $19.12, an increase of $1.48 from the prior day’s close.

On November 13, 2016, Sponsor A and Sponsor B together submitted a preliminary revised draft guarantee and disclosure letter,
and a proposed equity commitment letter.

On November 14, 2016, a company, which we refer to as “Strategic A,” contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs to discuss
recent media reports regarding the potential sale of LifeLock. Strategic A stated that it might be interested in participating in a process
to acquire LifeLock. The LifeLock Board had previously determined not to contact Strategic A for a variety of reasons, including,
among other things, concerns about Strategic A’s ability to consummate a transaction and the business risks associated with sharing
confidential information with Strategic A.

On November 15, 2016, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman Sachs and
Wilson Sonsini in attendance. The representatives of Goldman Sachs provided the Strategic Committee with an update on the process
to date and noted that Strategic A had contacted representatives of Goldman Sachs to find out additional information on the process

of the merger agreement (which included the minimum cash condition requirement), guarantee, and disclosure letter, and drafts of
equity and debt commitment letters.

Later on November 15, 2016, Sponsor C submitted a final written proposal to acquire LifeLock for $17.50 per share of common
stock in cash. Sponsor C provided revised drafts of the merger agreement, guarantee, and disclosure letter, and drafts of equity and debt
commitment letters.

On November 16, 2016, Symantec submitted a final written proposal to acquire LifeLock for $22.05 per share of common stock
in cash. In connection with Symantec’s revised proposal, it also submitted revised drafts of the merger agreement and the disclosure
letter, and draft debt commitment letters. In addition, Symantec provided a form of support agreement to be entered into by Ms.
Schneider, Todd Davis, Executive Vice Chairman of the LifeLock Board, David Cowan, a member of the LifeLock Board and partner
at Bessemer Venture Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners, a significant stockholder of LifeLock, and other parties to be determined.
Symantec’s proposal requested that LifeLock agree to negotiate on an exclusive basis through the morning of November 21,
2016. Representatives of Symantec also contacted several members of the LifeLock Board and representatives of LifeLock’s advisors
to reiterate Symantec’s interest.

Later on November 16, 2016, representatives of Goldman Sachs responded to Strategic A and advised that Strategic A would
need to enter into a confidentiality agreement with LifeLock in order to discuss a potential acquisition of LifeLock. The representatives
of Goldman Sachs then sent Strategic A a draft confidentiality agreement. Strategic A never responded to that agreement.

Later on November 16, 2016, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman
Sachs, Wilson Sonsini and Skadden in attendance. The members of the Strategic Committee reviewed and discussed the process to
date, and the terms of the proposals submitted by (1) Symantec; (2) Sponsor A and Sponsor B; and (3) Sponsor C. The members of the
Strategic Committee discussed with the representatives of each of Goldman Sachs, Wilson Sonsini and Skadden the difference in price
and terms among the proposals. After discussing the terms of Sponsor C’s offer, the Strategic Committee instructed the representatives
of Goldman Sachs to inform Sponsor C that its offer was well below the other offers that LifeLock had received and to inform Sponsor
C that LifeLock was no longer considering Sponsor C’s proposal. The members of the Strategic Committee considered the breadth of
the process to date and the interactions with the parties to date. The Strategic Committee also discussed the various risks involved in a
prolonged continuation of the process, including possible adverse impact on LifeLock’s business and the risk that one or more of the
parties that had participated in the process to date would withdraw from the process in response to any request to improve their
respective proposals. The Strategic Committee discussed with representatives of Goldman Sachs their collective judgment, based on
their interactions with parties and the terms of the proposals, that both of the remaining interested parties—Sponsor A-Sponsor B and
Symantec—each likely had the ability to increase the price that it was offering. The Strategic Committee instructed Goldman Sachs to
communicate to Symantec that Symantec would need to increase its price in order to remain competitive and to encourage Sponsor A-
Sponsor B to increase its proposal as well. The Strategic Committee instructed representatives of Goldman Sachs to request both
Sponsor A-Sponsor B and Symantec to submit revised best and final proposals to acquire LifeLock the next day.

On November 17, 2016, Sponsor A and Sponsor B together submitted a revised proposal for an acquisition of LifeLock at a price
of $23.15 in cash per share of common stock. The proposal indicated that Sponsor A-Sponsor B would lower the amount of the
minimum cash condition. Later on November 17, 2016, Symantec submitted a revised proposal for an acquisition of LifeLock at a
price of $23.80 in cash per share of common stock. During the morning of November 17, 2016, in connection with the review of the
revised offers submitted by each of Sponsor A-Sponsor B and Symantec, it was discovered that the number of fully diluted shares of
common stock previously supplied to bidders in due diligence materials posted to LifeLock’s electronic data room may have been
interpreted by interested parties to be overstated.

Later on November 17, 2016, the Strategic Committee met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman
Sachs, Wilson Sonsini and Skadden in attendance. The members of the Strategic Committee discussed the acquisition process and
discussions with the remaining interested parties. The representatives of Goldman Sachs discussed with the members of the Strategic
Committee the proposals received and noted that both Sponsor A-Sponsor B and Symantec had expressed concern related to the
continued incremental bidding and were seeking a conclusion of the process. The members of the Strategic Committee discussed the
potential overstatement of the fully diluted shares of common stock and the impact that any overstatement could have on the proposals
that had been submitted. In that regard, it was noted that an overstatement should have no impact on LifeLock’s enterprise value. The
Strategic Committee instructed Goldman Sachs to contact Symantec and Sponsor A-Sponsor B concerning the potential overstatement
and to ask both parties to either submit a revised proposal to take into account the potential overstatement or to confirm its proposal, in
each case before the meeting of the LifeLock Board scheduled for later that afternoon.

Following the Strategic Committee meeting, the representatives of Goldman Sachs contacted Symantec and Sponsor A-Sponsor
B to discuss the correct number of fully diluted shares of common stock to be used in preparing proposals. Symantec stated that it had
identified the potential overstatement in its due diligence and it therefore would not change its proposal of $23.80 in cash per share.
Sponsor A and Sponsor B revised their joint proposal to $23.31 in cash per share, which reflected the same enterprise value as their
previous proposal of $23.15.

Later on November 17, 2016, the LifeLock Board met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman Sachs,
Wilson Sonsini and Skadden in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reviewed with the members of the LifeLock Board
their fiduciary duties. The members of the LifeLock Board and the representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed and discussed the
process to date, including the fact that 46 parties had been contacted during the outreach period from July 2016 to September 2016. The
members of the LifeLock Board reviewed the terms of the final offers. The members of the Strategic Committee provided their view on
the process and offers received. The members of the LifeLock Board discussed various considerations raised by the two proposals,
including, among other things, (1) the certainty and execution risks of the respective proposals, including the financing provisions
included in Sponsor A-Sponsor B’s proposal; (2) likely timing for closing; and (3) the relative financing needs of Sponsor A-Sponsor B
and Symantec. The LifeLock Board considered, in light of LifeLock’s request for best and final offers, (1) what each bidder had
communicated regarding its ability or inability to increase its offer; (2) Goldman Sachs’ previous communications with each bidder;
and (3) the risk to the process of potentially alienating one or both parties by requesting an increased proposal. The representatives of
Wilson Sonsini noted that a definitive agreement for an acquisition would permit LifeLock to respond to unsolicited acquisition
proposals and include the ability to accept a superior proposal, subject to payment of a termination fee. The LifeLock Board evaluated
the two proposals and authorized the representatives of Goldman Sachs to contact Symantec and inform Symantec that if Symantec
increased its offer to $24.00 per share in cash, then LifeLock would agree to negotiate exclusively with Symantec through the morning
of November 21, 2016. The LifeLock Board also authorized Goldman Sachs to indicate to Sponsor A-Sponsor B that LifeLock was
planning to enter into exclusive negotiations with another party.

Later on November 17, 2016, representatives of Goldman Sachs informed Sponsor A-Sponsor B that LifeLock was pursuing a
transaction with another party. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then communicated the proposed price increase and exclusivity
proposal to Symantec. Representatives of Goldman Sachs also described to Symantec various areas of concern with Symantec’s
markup of the merger agreement, which would need to be negotiated. Symantec notified the representatives of Goldman Sachs that it
would increase its proposal to $24.00 in cash per share if LifeLock would enter exclusivity that evening and work to execute a
definitive agreement by November 20, 2016. Following this, representatives of Fenwick, on behalf of Symantec, negotiated an
exclusivity agreement with representatives of Wilson Sonsini, on behalf of LifeLock. Later that evening, Symantec and LifeLock
executed the exclusivity agreement, which among other things, prohibited LifeLock from soliciting alternative acquisition proposals, or
engaging in negotiations with other parties regarding an alternative acquisition, until the morning of November 21, 2016.

Table of Contents

From November 18, 2016, to November 20, 2016, representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Skadden, on behalf of LifeLock, and
Fenwick, on behalf of Symantec, negotiated terms of the merger agreement, disclosure letter and the proposed support agreements. The
principal issues that were the subject of negotiation included: (1) the termination fee payable by LifeLock, which was the subject of
numerous proposals and counterproposals; (2) financing cooperation terms; (3) the outside date to satisfy regulatory approvals; and (4)
employee retention matters. Also during this period, Symantec confirmed it was requesting support agreements from Ms. Schneider,
Mr. Davis, Mr. Cowan and Bessemer Venture Partners, and these parties and their respective counsels negotiated the terms of the
support agreements with Fenwick, on behalf of Symantec.

In the afternoon of November 20, 2016, the LifeLock Board met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management,
Goldman Sachs, Wilson Sonsini and Skadden in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed with the members of the
LifeLock Board their fiduciary duties. The representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wilson Sonsini reviewed the terms of the merger
agreement and Symantec’s proposal for an acquisition of LifeLock at $24.00 in cash per share, as well as the terms of the proposal that
had been received from Sponsor A and Sponsor B. The representatives of Goldman Sachs reviewed with the members of the LifeLock
Board Goldman Sachs’ financial analysis of the $24.00 per share cash consideration offered to LifeLock stockholders in the proposed
merger. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini discussed the process to date, including the proposals that had been made by Sponsor A-
Sponsor B and by Symantec. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini reported on negotiations with Symantec and described the principal
terms of the proposed merger agreement. The members of the LifeLock Board discussed the process conducted, parties contacted, the
negotiations with multiple parties and proposals received, as well as the likelihood that an additional extension of the process and
additional negotiations could yield incremental value relative to the risk that such extension and additional negotiations could have on
Symantec’s or Sponsor A-Sponsor B’s willingness to proceed. The members of the LifeLock Board discussed potential reasons for, and
risks inherent in, entering into the merger agreement, including consideration of the factors described in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “—Reasons for the Merger.” The members of the Strategic Committee reviewed with the LifeLock Board its
process to date. Each member of the Strategic Committee provided his recommendation that LifeLock should accept Symantec’s
proposal. The representatives of Goldman Sachs then rendered Goldman Sachs’ oral opinion to the LifeLock Board, which opinion
was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated November 20, 2016, that, as of November 20, 2016, and based
upon and subject to the various assumptions, considerations, limitations and other matters set forth therein, the per share merger
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of common stock (other than Symantec or any affiliate of Symantec) pursuant to
the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. For more information about Goldman Sachs’ opinion, see
the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Fairness Opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co.” After further discussion, the LifeLock
Board unanimously (1) determined that it was in the best interests of LifeLock and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter
into the merger agreement and consummate the merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement;
(2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by LifeLock, the performance by LifeLock of its covenants and other
obligations in the merger agreement, and the consummation of the merger upon the terms and conditions set forth in the merger
agreement; (3) directed that the adoption of the merger agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the stockholders of LifeLock;
and (4) resolved to recommend that LifeLock stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement in accordance with the
DGCL and the other proposals to be presented at the special meeting.

Later on November 20, 2016, the merger agreement was signed by LifeLock, Acquisition Sub and Symantec, and the support
agreements were signed by Symantec and each of Ms. Schneider, Mr. Davis, Mr. Cowan and Bessemer Venture Partners. LifeLock and
Symantec then issued a joint press release announcing the entry into the merger agreement.

On December 8, 2016, the LifeLock Board met, with representatives of each of LifeLock management, Goldman Sachs, Wilson
Sonsini and Skadden in attendance. The representatives of Wilson Sonsini and Skadden discussed with the members of the LifeLock
Board their fiduciary duties and the terms of the merger agreement,

including the provisions regarding the LifeLock Board’s recommendation to stockholders. The representatives of Goldman Sachs
advised the members of the LifeLock Board that a stock price used in the historical stock trading analysis and in the M&A premia
analysis as the closing stock price of LifeLock on June 16, 2016, was not correct, but that had Goldman Sachs performed its financial
analyses as of November 20, 2016, using the correct stock price (as described below under “Fairness Opinion of Goldman, Sachs &
Co.” and reviewed with the LifeLock Board at such meeting), there would have been no change to the conclusion set forth in the
written opinion of Goldman Sachs. The LifeLock Board then considered such confirmation from Goldman Sachs, any relevant
developments since the execution of the merger agreement (concluding that there were no material developments) and the terms of the
merger agreement. After deliberation, the LifeLock Board unanimously determined to authorize the filing of the preliminary proxy
statement, including the recommendation to the stockholders to adopt the merger agreement as set forth herein.

Recommendation of the LifeLock Board and Reasons for the Merger

Recommendation of the LifeLock Board

The LifeLock Board has unanimously (1) determined that it is in the best interests of LifeLock and its stockholders, and
declared it advisable, to enter into the merger agreement and consummate the merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the merger agreement; (2) approved the execution and delivery of the merger agreement by LifeLock,
the performance by LifeLock of its covenants and other obligations in the merger agreement, and the consummation of the
merger upon the terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement; (3) directed that the adoption of the merger
agreement be submitted to a vote at the special meeting; and (4) resolved to recommend that the LifeLock stockholders vote in
favor of the adoption of the merger agreement in accordance with the DGCL.

The LifeLock Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement;
(2) “FOR” the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting; and (3) “FOR” the
approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger.

Reasons for the Merger

In evaluating the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, the LifeLock
Board consulted with the Strategic Committee, LifeLock management, its financial advisor and its outside legal advisors. In
recommending that LifeLock stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement, the LifeLock Board considered a number
of factors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
 

 •  LifeLock’s competitive positioning and prospects as a standalone company;
 

 •  LifeLock’s business operations and management;
 

 
•  LifeLock’s historical and projected financial performance, results of operation and financial prospects, including the risks

associated with achieving the Forecasts;
 

 

•  the financial analysis presentation of Goldman Sachs, and the opinion of Goldman Sachs delivered to the LifeLock Board
that, as of November 20, 2016, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $24.00 in
cash per share of common stock to be paid to the holders (other than Symantec and its affiliates) of common stock pursuant
to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders, as more fully described in the section of this
proxy statement captioned “—Fairness Opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co;”

 

 
•  the relationship of the per share merger consideration to the trading prices of the common stock, including that the per share

merger consideration constituted a premium of approximately (1) 59.4% to

the closing price of the common stock on June 16, 2016, the last trading day prior to the public filing by Elliott Associates,
L.P. and certain affiliates that they had accumulated a significant minority interest in LifeLock; (2) 91.8% to the three-month
volume weighted average price per share of common stock, which we refer to as the “VWAP,” for the period ending June 16,
2016; (3) 96.6% to the six-month VWAP for the period ending June 16, 2016; (4) 94.9% to the nine-month VWAP for the
period ending June 16, 2016; and (5) 108.3% to the 12-month VWAP for the period ending June 16, 2016;

 

 
•  based on its review of the process conducted by the Strategic Committee and the LifeLock Board and negotiations with

Symantec as well as the other parties participating in such process, the LifeLock Board’s belief that $24.00 per share in cash
and the terms of the merger agreement offer the best value reasonably attainable for LifeLock stockholders;

 

 
•  that the all-cash merger consideration will provide certainty of value and liquidity to LifeLock stockholders, while

eliminating the effect of long-term business and execution related risks;
 

 
•  the LifeLock Board’s view that the merger agreement was the product of arm’s-length negotiation and contained customary

terms and conditions;
 

 •  the terms of the merger agreement, including:
 

 
•  LifeLock’s ability, under certain circumstances, to furnish information to and conduct negotiations with third parties

regarding unsolicited acquisition proposals;
 

 

•  the LifeLock Board’s view that the terms of the merger agreement would be unlikely to deter third parties from
making a superior proposal, including the merger agreement’s terms and conditions as they relate to the ability to
make changes in the recommendation of the LifeLock Board (see the sections of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative Acquisition Offers” and “The Merger Agreement—The LifeLock
Board’s Recommendation; Adverse Recommendation Change”);

 

 
•  LifeLock’s ability to terminate the merger agreement in order to accept an unsolicited superior proposal, subject to

paying Symantec a termination fee of $87.5 million and complying with the other conditions of the merger
agreement;

 

 

•  the LifeLock Board’s belief that the termination fee of $87.5 million, which is approximately 3.5% of LifeLock’s
implied equity value in the merger, is reasonable, consistent with comparable transactions and not preclusive of other
offers, especially in light of the comprehensive process conducted by the Strategic Committee and the LifeLock
Board;

 

 
•  LifeLock’s entitlement to specific performance to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce

specifically the terms of the merger agreement, including the consummation of the merger in accordance with the
terms of the merger agreement; and

 

 
•  that the consummation of the merger is not subject to any financing condition or limitation on damages for failure to

close;
 

 
•  the requirement that the merger will only be consummated if the merger agreement is adopted by the holders of at least a

majority of the outstanding shares of common stock;
 

 
•  the extensive process employed by the Strategic Committee and the LifeLock Board to identify potential acquirors of

LifeLock, including contacting a broad range of companies and financial sponsors to assess their interest in a potential
acquisition of LifeLock;

 

 •  the following, each of which provided an opportunity for unsolicited proposals to be made for LifeLock:
 

 
•  the public filing by Elliott Associates, L.P. and certain affiliates that they had accumulated a significant minority

interest in LifeLock and the subsequent filing encouraging LifeLock to undertake a strategic review process; and

Table of Contents

 •  publicly reported rumors of the sale process and the identity of LifeLock’s financial advisor;
 

 
•  that of the potential acquirors that submitted final proposals to acquire LifeLock, none made a final bid equal to or in excess

of $24.00 per share of common stock;
 

 

•  the extensive, arm’s-length negotiations with Symantec and other interested parties, which, among other things, resulted in
an increase in the merger consideration to $24.00 per share of common stock, an increase from Symantec’s original
proposed merger consideration of $20.00 per share and Symantec’s November 16, 2016, proposal of $22.50 per share and a
further increase from Symantec’s November 17, 2016, proposal of $23.80 per share;

 

 

•  the perceived risk of continuing as a standalone public company or pursuing other alternatives, including (1) the
continuation of LifeLock’s business plan as an independent enterprise; (2) modifications to LifeLock’s strategy and product
direction; and (3) potential expansion opportunities into new business lines through acquisitions and combinations of
LifeLock with other businesses, in addition to other operating risks identified in LifeLock’s public filings with the SEC;

 

 •  that the members of the Strategic Committee unanimously recommended the merger to the LifeLock Board;
 

 •  the fact that LifeLock stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL; and
 

 •  the LifeLock Board’s fiduciary duties in light of the foregoing.

The LifeLock Board also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the merger, including the following (which factors
are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
 

 
•  that LifeLock stockholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth of LifeLock and will not benefit from any

appreciations in the value of LifeLock, including any appreciation in value that could be realized as a result of the
combination of LifeLock with Symantec;

 

 
•  the risk that the merger might not be completed unless and until certain specified conditions are satisfied or waived (as more

fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the
Merger”);

 

 
•  the right of Symantec to terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances (as more fully described in the section

of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement”);
 

 
•  the effect of the resulting public announcement of the termination of the merger agreement on the trading price of the

common stock;
 

 
•  that under the terms of the merger agreement, LifeLock is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals during the pendency

of the merger;
 

 

•  the restrictions on the conduct of LifeLock’s business prior to the consummation of the merger, including the requirement
that LifeLock conduct its business in the ordinary course, subject to specific limitations, which may delay or prevent
LifeLock from undertaking business opportunities that may arise before the completion of the merger and that, absent the
merger agreement, LifeLock might have pursued;

 

 
•  the requirement that LifeLock pay Symantec a termination fee of $87.5 million under certain circumstances following

termination of the merger agreement, including if the LifeLock Board terminates the merger agreement to accept a superior
offer;

 

 
•  the requirement that the merger will only be consummated if the merger agreement is adopted by the holders of at least a

majority of the outstanding shares of common stock;
 

 
•  the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the merger agreement and completing the merger, and the

substantial time and effort of LifeLock management required to complete the merger, which may disrupt LifeLock’s
business operations;

Table of Contents

 •  that LifeLock’s business, sales operations and financial results could suffer in the event that the merger is not consummated;
 

 •  that the completion of the merger will require antitrust clearance in the United States;
 

 
•  that LifeLock’s directors and officers may have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of

other LifeLock’s stockholders (see the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger”);

 

 

•  that the announcement and pendency of the merger, or the failure to complete the merger, may cause substantial harm to
LifeLock’s relationships with its employees (including making it more difficult to attract and retain key personnel and the
possible loss of key management, technical, sales and other personnel), vendors, customers and other partners and may
divert management and employees attention away from LifeLock’s day-to-day business operations; and

 

 
•  that receipt of the merger consideration will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as more

fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger.”

The foregoing discussion is not meant to be exhaustive, but summarizes the material factors considered by the LifeLock
Board in its consideration of the merger. After considering these and other factors, the LifeLock Board concluded that the
potential benefits of the merger outweighed the uncertainties and risks. In view of the variety of factors considered by the
LifeLock Board and the complexity of these factors, the LifeLock Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or
otherwise assign relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching its determination and recommendations. Moreover, each
member of the LifeLock Board applied his or her own business judgment to the process and may have assigned different
weights to different factors. The LifeLock Board unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and recommends that LifeLock stockholders adopt the merger agreement
based upon the totality of the information presented to and considered by the LifeLock Board.

Fairness Opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co.

Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the LifeLock Board on November 20, 2016, which opinion was subsequently confirmed in
a written opinion dated as of the same date, that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the factors and
assumptions set forth therein, the per share merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Symantec and its affiliates) of
common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated November 20, 2016, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached
as Annex B. Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the LifeLock Board in connection with
its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of common stock
should vote with respect to the merger, or any other matter.

In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed,
among other things:
 

 •  the merger agreement;
 

 
•  annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of LifeLock for the four fiscal years ended December 31,

2015;
 

 
•  LifeLock’s Registration Statement on Form S-1, including the prospectus contained therein, dated September 27, 2012,

relating to LifeLock’s initial public offering of common stock;

Table of Contents

 •  certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of LifeLock;
 

 •  certain other communications from LifeLock to its stockholders;
 

 •  certain publicly available research analyst reports for LifeLock; and
 

 

•  certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for LifeLock, inclusive of estimated net present value of standalone net
operating losses, prepared by its management, summarized below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—
Financial Forecasts,” as approved for Goldman Sachs’ use by LifeLock, which are referred to in such section as the “Five-
Year Forecasts.”

Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of LifeLock regarding their assessment of the past
and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of LifeLock; reviewed the reported price and trading activity
for the common stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for LifeLock with similar information for certain other
companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations; and
performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.

For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with LifeLock’s consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by
it, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with LifeLock’s
consent that the Five-Year Forecasts were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the management of LifeLock. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and
liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of LifeLock or any of its subsidiaries
and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other
consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected
benefits of the merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs also assumed that the merger would be consummated on
the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be
in any way meaningful to its analysis.

Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not address the underlying business decision of LifeLock to engage in the merger or the relative
merits of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to LifeLock; nor does it address any legal,
regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs’ opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders
(other than Symantec and its affiliates) of common stock, as of the date of the opinion, of the per share merger consideration to be paid
to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs’ opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any
other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument
contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the merger, including, the fairness of the merger
to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other
constituencies of LifeLock; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the
officers, directors or employees of LifeLock, or class of such persons, in connection with the merger, whether relative to the per share
merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Symantec and its affiliates) of common stock pursuant to the merger
agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in
effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for
updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion. In
addition, Goldman Sachs does not express any opinion as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of LifeLock or
Symantec or the ability of LifeLock or Symantec to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs’ opinion was
approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.

Table of Contents

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the LifeLock Board in connection
with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the
financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight
given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular
format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman
Sachs’ financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market
data, is based on market data as it existed on or before November 18, 2016, the last trading day before the public announcement of the
merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

Following Goldman Sachs’ presentation to the LifeLock Board on November 20, 2016, (which we refer to as the “November 20
Presentation”), Goldman Sachs determined, and notified LifeLock, on December 2, 2016, that the closing stock price of LifeLock on
June 16, 2016, used in the historical stock trading analysis and in the M&A premia analysis was not correct. Goldman Sachs
subsequently performed both such analyses, as of November 20, 2016, using the correct closing stock price of LifeLock on June 16,
2016 (which we refer to as the “Corrected Stock Price”) and delivered such analyses to LifeLock on December 6, 2016, and discussed
such analyses with the members of the LifeLock Board at a meeting held on December 8, 2016. Such subsequent analyses performed
by Goldman Sachs do not address any circumstances, developments or events occurring after November 20, 2016, which is the date of
the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, and Goldman Sachs’ opinion set forth in its written opinion letter was provided only as of such
date. Based upon and subject to the foregoing, Goldman Sachs confirmed to the LifeLock Board on December 6, 2016, and discussed
its confirmation with the members of the LifeLock Board at a meeting held on December 8, 2016, that, had Goldman Sachs performed
its financial analyses set forth in the presentation on November 20, 2016, using the Corrected Stock Price, there would have been no
change to the conclusion set forth in the written opinion of Goldman Sachs that the per share merger consideration to be paid to the
holders (other than Symantec and its affiliates) of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of
view to such holders.

Historical Stock Trading Analysis

Goldman Sachs reviewed historical trading prices and volumes for shares of common stock. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed
the consideration to be paid to holders of shares of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement in relation to (1) the closing price
per share of common stock on November 18, 2016, the last trading day before the meeting of the LifeLock Board at which the
LifeLock Board approved the merger; (2) the closing price per share of common stock on June 16, 2016, the last trading day prior to
the public filing by Elliott and certain of its affiliates of a Statement of Beneficial Ownership on Schedule 13D with the SEC, which
date we refer to as the “Pre-13D date;” (3) the VWAP for the preceding three-month, six-month, nine-month and 12-month periods
ended on the Pre-13D date; (4) the high and low trading prices per share of common stock over the 52-week period ended November
18, 2016; and (5) the all-time high closing price per share of common stock on or prior to November 18, 2016.

This analysis indicated that the price per share to be paid to LifeLock stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement represented:
 

 
•  a premium of 15.7% based on the closing price per share of common stock of $20.75 on November 18, 2016, which was also

the highest trading price per share of common stock over the 52-week period ended on November 18, 2016;
 

 •  a premium of 59.4% based on the closing price per share of common stock on the Pre-13D date of $15.06;*
 
* The November 20 Presentation stated that the price per share to be paid to the LifeLock stockholders pursuant to the merger

agreement represented a premium of 83.1% based on the use of an incorrect closing price of $13.11 per share of common stock on
the Pre-13D date.

 •  a premium of 91.8% based on the VWAP for the three-month period ended on the Pre-13D date of $12.51;
 

 •  a premium of 96.6% based on the VWAP for the six-month period ended on the Pre-13D date of $12.21;
 

 •  a premium of 94.9% based on the VWAP for the nine-month period ended on the Pre-13D date of $12.32;
 

 •  a premium of 108.3% based on the VWAP for the 12-month period ended on the Pre-13D date of $11.52;
 

 
•  a premium of 162.6% based on $9.14, the lowest trading price per share of common stock over the 52-week period ended

November 18, 2016; and
 

 
•  a premium of 6.1% based on $22.62, the closing price per share of common stock on February 13, 2014, the all-time high

closing price per share of common stock on or prior to November 18, 2016.

Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis

Goldman Sachs performed illustrative analyses of the implied present value of the future price per share of common stock, which
were designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of a company’s equity as a function of (1)
LifeLock’s estimated forward free cash flow yield, which we refer to as the “Forward FCF Yield,” and an assumed price to Forward
FCF Yield per share multiple and (2) LifeLock’s Enterprise Value (which is defined as the equity value, calculated using the number of
fully diluted shares of common stock, as provided by management of LifeLock, plus total debt, less total cash and cash equivalents,
and which we refer to as “EV”), as a one-year forward multiple of estimated future Adjusted EBITDA (which is defined in the section
of this proxy statement captioned “—Financial Forecasts,” which multiple we refer to as the “Forward EV/EBITDA multiple”). For
these analyses, Goldman Sachs used the Five-Year Forecasts for each of the fiscal years 2018 to 2021 and the number of fully diluted
shares as of the end of each such year as set forth in the Five-Year Forecasts, in each case as provided to Goldman Sachs by the
management of LifeLock. Goldman Sachs first calculated the implied future equity values per share of common stock at year-end for
each of the fiscal years 2017 to 2020 using the forward free cash flow per share set forth in the Five-Year Forecasts for those years and
then applying a Forward FCF Yield range of 6.6% to 9.9%. In addition, Goldman Sachs calculated implied future equity values per
share of common stock at year-end for each of the fiscal years 2017 through 2020 using the next-12 month Adjusted EBITDA set forth
in the Five-Year Forecasts for those years by applying Forward EV/EBITDA multiples ranging from 9.0x to 13.6x to the applicable
next-twelve month Adjusted EBITDA as set forth in the Five-Year Forecasts. Goldman Sachs then, in each case, discounted the
implied year-end 2017 to 2020 equity values back to September 30, 2016 using an illustrative discount rate of 10.0%, reflecting an
estimate of LifeLock’s cost of equity. These analyses resulted in an illustrative range of implied present values per share of common
stock of (1) $11.86 to $19.84 using the Forward FCF Yield method and (2) $12.25 to $26.20 using the Forward EV/EBITDA multiples.

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Using the Five-Year Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on LifeLock. Using
discount rates ranging from 7.50% to 8.50%, reflecting estimates of LifeLock’s weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs
discounted to present value as of September 30, 2016 (1) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for LifeLock for the fourth calendar
quarter of 2016 and the fiscal years 2017 through 2021 as reflected in the Five-Year Forecasts and (2) a range of illustrative terminal
values for LifeLock, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.50% to 3.50%, to a terminal year
estimate of the free cash flow to be generated by LifeLock, as reflected in the Five-Year Forecasts. Goldman Sachs derived ranges of
illustrative enterprise values for LifeLock by adding the ranges of present values it derived above and the present value of the net
operating losses, as prepared by LifeLock’s management. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from the range of illustrative enterprise
values it derived for LifeLock the

Table of Contents

amount by which LifeLock’s indebtedness exceeded its cash as of September 30, 2016, as provided by the management of LifeLock, to
derive a range of illustrative equity values for LifeLock. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values that it
derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of LifeLock, as provided by the management of LifeLock, to derive a range
of illustrative present values per share ranging from $19.26 to $26.38.

Selected Historical Premia Analysis

Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available data, the average and median acquisition premia calculated using
the closing trading prices per share one day, one week and four weeks prior to announcement, respectively, for all-cash acquisition
transactions with disclosed transaction enterprise values between $1 billion and $5 billion from January 1, 2004 through November 18,
2016. The results of this analysis are set forth below:
 

Reference trading price date   Average Premium  Median Premium 
1 day prior to announcement    32.2%   26.6% 
1 week prior to announcement    33.6%   29.9% 
4 weeks prior to announcement    38.5%   32.9% 

In addition, Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available data, the acquisition premia represented by the
trading price per share one day prior to the announcement of the transaction for the same set of transactions outlined above after they
had been categorized according to the percentage of the 52-week high trading price represented by the closing trading price per share
one day prior to the announcement of the transaction. The results of this analysis were as follows:
 

% of 52-week High Represented by Closing
Trading Price One Day Prior to Announcement   Average One-Day Premia Paid 
0-10%    (3.2)% 
10-20%    181.4% 
20-30%    38.5% 
30-40%    121.4% 
40-50%    48.6% 
50-60%    20.0% 
60-70%    54.7% 
70-80%    26.5% 
80-90%    25.0% 
90-100%    17.7% 

Goldman Sachs then applied an illustrative range of premia of 26.5%, representing the average one day premium paid for
companies with closing trading prices one day prior to announcement that were 70 to 80% of their 52 week high, to 26.6%,
representing the average premium paid over the closing price one day prior to announcement, to derive an illustrative range of implied
values per share of common stock of $19.05 to $19.07. In the November 20 Presentation, due to the use of the incorrect closing stock
price as of the Pre-13D date, this analysis used a range of premia of 26.6% to 54.7% (representing the average one day premium paid
for companies with closing trading prices one day prior to announcement that were 60 to 70% of their 52 week high) and derived an
illustrative range of implied values per share of common stock of $16.60 to $20.28.

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could
create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman
Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it.
Rather, Goldman

Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all
of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to LifeLock or the
contemplated transaction.

Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs providing its opinion to the LifeLock Board as to the
fairness from a financial point of view of the per share merger consideration to be paid to the holders (other than Symantec and its
affiliates) of common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily
reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not
necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.
Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the
parties or their respective advisors, none of LifeLock, Symantec, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future
results are materially different from those forecast.

The per share merger consideration was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between LifeLock and Symantec and was
approved by the LifeLock Board. Goldman Sachs did not recommend any specific amount of consideration to LifeLock or the
LifeLock Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.

As described above, Goldman Sachs’ opinion to the LifeLock Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the
LifeLock Board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a
complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B.

Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading,
research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities.
Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other
economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in
securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the LifeLock, Symantec,
any of their respective affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated
by the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to LifeLock in connection with, and participated in certain of the
negotiations leading to, the transaction contemplated by the merger agreement. During the two year period ended November 20, 2016,
the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has not been engaged by LifeLock, Symantec or any of their respective affiliates
to provide financial advisory or underwriting services for which Goldman Sachs has received compensation. Goldman Sachs may in
the future provide investment banking services to LifeLock, Symantec and their respective affiliates for which the Investment Banking
Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation.

The LifeLock Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment
banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated July
13, 2016, LifeLock engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. The engagement letter
between LifeLock and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of
the date of announcement, at approximately $24.5 million, $23.5 million of which is contingent upon consummation of the
merger. In addition, LifeLock has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys’ fees and
disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities
under the federal securities laws.

Financial Forecasts

LifeLock provided to Symantec, as part of the due diligence process, in September 2016, certain internal financial analyses and
projections for 2016 through 2019 that LifeLock had prepared in July 2016, which we refer to as the “July Forecasts.” The July
Forecasts were provided to other interested parties who were part of the strategic transaction exploration process. LifeLock does not
publicly disclose these types of projections as a matter of course and they were shared with parties who had executed confidentiality
agreements with LifeLock. In October 2016, LifeLock updated the July Forecasts solely to reflect LifeLock management’s updated
view of LifeLock’s estimated fiscal year 2016 performance, which we refer to as the “October Revisions.” The October Revisions were
provided to Symantec and the other remaining participants in the strategic transaction exploration process in late October 2016.

In addition, based on certain estimates and assumptions of LifeLock management, for purposes of assisting Goldman Sachs with
its financial analysis, the LifeLock Board also reviewed, and LifeLock approved for Goldman Sachs’ use, projected financial
information for the period from 2020 to 2021 extrapolated from the forecasts for the period 2016 through 2019. We refer to the
projected financial information for the period from 2020 to 2021 extrapolated from the July Forecasts as the “Additional Two-Year
Forecasts.” We refer to the July Forecasts, as updated by the October Revisions, together with the Additional Two-Year Forecasts, as
the “Five-Year Forecasts.” We refer to the July Forecasts and the October Revisions, together with the Additional Two-Year Forecasts,
collectively as the “Forecasts.”

The Forecasts were not prepared for purpose of public disclosure and are included in this proxy statement only because (1) the
July Forecasts and the October Revisions were made available to Symantec and its lenders in connection with the due diligence review
of LifeLock as outlined above; (2) the Five-Year Forecasts were made available to Goldman Sachs for use in connection with its
financial analysis as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Fairness Opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co.” and (3)
the Forecasts (including the Additional Two-Year Forecasts) were made available to the LifeLock Board in connection with their
consideration of a potential acquisition of LifeLock. The Forecasts were not prepared with a view to compliance with (1) generally
accepted accounting principles as applied in the United States, which we refer to as “GAAP;” (2) the published guidelines of the SEC
regarding projections and forward-looking statements; or (3) the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. The Forecasts included in this proxy statement were
not prepared by, and are not the responsibility of, Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm. Furthermore,
Ernst & Young LLP has not examined, reviewed, compiled or otherwise applied procedures to the Forecasts and, accordingly, assumes
no responsibility for, and expresses no opinion or any other form of assurance on, them. The Ernst & Young LLP report incorporated
by reference in this proxy statement relates to our historical financial information. It does not extend to prospective financial
information and should not be read to do so.

Although the Forecasts are presented with numerical specificity, they reflect numerous assumptions and estimates as to future
events made by LifeLock management that they believed were reasonable at the time the Forecasts were prepared, taking into account
the relevant information available to LifeLock management at the time. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied
upon as being necessarily indicative of actual future results. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the Forecasts not
to be achieved include (1) general economic conditions; (2) LifeLock’s ability to achieve forecasted revenue; (3) the accuracy of
certain accounting assumptions; (4) changes in actual or projected cash flows; (5) competitive pressures; and (6) changes in tax laws.
In addition, the Forecasts do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date that they were prepared and do
not give effect to the merger. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Forecasts will be realized, and actual results may be
materially better or worse than those contained in the Forecasts. The inclusion of the Forecasts in this proxy statement should not be
regarded as an indication that the LifeLock Board, LifeLock or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers,
the Forecasts to be predictive of actual future results, or that the Forecasts are material. The Forecasts were not prepared for

public disclosure and are not included in this proxy statement in order to induce any stockholder to vote in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement or any of the other proposals to be voted on at the special meeting. LifeLock does not intend to update or
otherwise revise the Forecasts to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future
events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the Forecasts are shown to be in error or no longer
appropriate. In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Forecasts, LifeLock stockholders are
cautioned not to rely on the projections included in this proxy statement and LifeLock may not achieve the Forecasts whether
or not the merger is completed.

As referred to below, “Adjusted EBITDA” is a financial measure commonly used in the technology industry but is not defined
under GAAP. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation,
interest expense, interest income, other income (expense), income tax (benefit) expense, and acquisition related expenses, when
applicable. For fiscal year 2016, we have also excluded from Adjusted EBITDA expenses related to the FTC litigation and the impact
of a legal reserve for the settlement of a stockholder derivative lawsuit. We believe that the exclusion of certain items of income and
expense from net income (loss) in calculating Adjusted EBITDA is useful because the amount of such income or expense may not
directly correlate to the underlying operational performance of our business and/or such income and expense can vary significantly
between periods.

We define “Free Cash Flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less net cash used in investing activities for acquisitions
of property and equipment. For fiscal year 2016, we have added back cash paid for expenses related to the FTC litigation and the
impact of a legal reserve for the settlement of a shareholder derivative lawsuit to net cash provided by operating activities.

We included Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow because they are key measures we used to understand and evaluate our core
operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In
particular, the exclusion of certain expenses and cash flows in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow can provide a useful
measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a key financial measure used in
determining management’s incentive compensation.

Although Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are frequently used by investors in their evaluations of companies, these non-
GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial
information presented in accordance with GAAP. Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP financial measures should be
considered alongside other financial performance measures. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any
standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other
companies.

are different from, or in addition to, the interests of LifeLock stockholders generally, as more fully described below. The LifeLock
Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters, in approving the
merger agreement and the merger and recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by LifeLock stockholders. This section
discusses such interests as held by each of (1) our non-employee directors, consisting of Gary Briggs, David Cowan, Roy Guthrie,
Albert Pimentel, Thomas J. Ridge and Jaynie Miller Studenmund, and (2) individuals who serve or have served as our executive
officers, including named executive officers of LifeLock specified in the annual proxy statement of LifeLock filed on March 24, 2016,
consisting of Todd Davis, Hilary Schneider, Doug Jeffries, Sharon Segev, Ty Shay, Chris Power and Ramakrishna (Schwark)
Satyavolu. Messrs. Power’s and Satyavolu’s service with us ended in October 2016 and September 2016, respectively. Solely for
purposes of this section of this proxy, references to executive officers include each of these individuals.

Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers

The merger agreement provides that the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Symantec and its subsidiaries will
cause the surviving corporation to) honor and fulfill, in all respects to the extent permitted under applicable law the obligations of
LifeLock and its subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements between LifeLock, on the one hand, and any of their
respective current or former directors, officers or employees of LifeLock, on the other hand. In addition, the merger agreement
provides that, during the six year period commencing at the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will (and Symantec
will cause the surviving corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each current or former director, officer or employee of LifeLock
or its subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by law, for acts and omissions in such capacity as well as legal proceedings relating to
the merger. Prior to the closing of the merger, LifeLock will be permitted to purchase, or after the closing Symantec will cause the
surviving corporation to maintain, a “tail” policy to its directors’ and officers’ insurance policies prior to the effective time of the
merger, provided that the annual premium for such insurance does not exceed 300% of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid
by LifeLock. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Indemnification and
Insurance.”

Post-Closing Employee Benefits

From and for a period of one year after the effective time of the merger, Symantec has agreed that each continuing employee’s
aggregate cash compensation, including base salary and target incentive compensation opportunity, payable to him or her will not be
reduced and has agreed to either (1) maintain for the benefit of each continuing employee LifeLock’s benefit plans (other than the
opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits, cash incentive, bonus, severance and, subject to the merger agreement, individual
employment agreements, which existing plans and agreements will be governed by and may only be amended according to their
respective terms) at benefit levels that are substantially equivalent to those in effect at LifeLock on the date of the merger agreement,
and provide compensation and benefits to each continuing employee pursuant to such benefit plans; (2) provide benefits to each
continuing employee that, taken as a whole, are substantially equivalent to those benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
Symantec; or (3) provide some combination of LifeLock and Symantec benefit plans such that each continuing employee receives
benefits that, taken as a whole, in any case with respect to clauses (1) through (3), are in the aggregate substantially equivalent to those
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Symantec. Additionally, for a period of one year following the effective time of the
merger, Symantec has agreed to provide severance benefits that are substantially equivalent to those benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Symantec and its affiliates. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
Agreement—Employee Benefits.”

Treatment of Equity-Based Awards

The discussion below describes the treatment of LifeLock’s outstanding equity awards under the merger agreement. Any cash
payments with respect to LifeLock equity awards described below will be subject to any applicable tax withholdings and unless
otherwise noted below, will be made shortly following the effective time.

Treatment of Stock Options

As of November 15, 2016, there were 374,111 shares of common stock subject to outstanding options held by our non-employee
directors and 3,947,083 shares of common stock subject to outstanding options held by our executive officers. At the effective time of
the merger, except with respect to any options to purchase shares of common stock held by non-employee directors, (a) the portion of
each option to purchase shares of common stock, including those pursuant to the LifeLock Stock Plans but not the ESPP, that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately before the effective time of the merger and that is vested as of the effective time of the
merger and (b) any portion of an option to purchase common stock, including pursuant to the LifeLock Stock Plans but not the ESPP,
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately before the effective time of the merger that by its terms accelerates vesting in
connection with the holder of such option ceasing, before, upon, or immediately after the effective time of the merger, to be a service
provider of LifeLock or its subsidiaries, which service providers we collectively refer to as terminated service providers and which
options we collectively refer to as the vested options, will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive cash
amount(s), without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the total number of shares of common stock issuable upon
exercise in full of such vested option by (2) the excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration, over the applicable per share
exercise price of such cancelled vested option.

At the effective time of the merger, except with respect to options to purchase shares of common stock held by a non-employee
director, the portion of each option to purchase shares of common stock, including those pursuant to the LifeLock Stock Plans but not
the ESPP, that is outstanding immediately before and at the effective time of the merger, that is unvested, unexercised and held by a
LifeLock service provider at the effective time of the merger, which we refer to as the “unvested options,” will be assumed by
Symantec and automatically converted into an option to acquire Symantec common stock, on the same terms and conditions applicable
to the unvested option immediately before the effective time of the merger, including the term, exercisability, and vesting schedule,
provided that the number of shares of Symantec common stock subject to the option and the per share exercise price will be adjusted,
which we refer to as “assumed options.” Each assumed option will cover a number of shares of Symantec common stock equal to the
number of shares of common stock that were subject to the unvested option immediately before the effective time of the merger
multiplied by an exchange ratio, with the resulting number rounded down to the nearest whole share. The per share exercise price for
each assumed option will equal the per share exercise price for the unvested option immediately before the effective time of the merger,
divided by the exchange ratio, with the resulting number rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The assumed options also remain
subject to any applicable provisions under the LifeLock Stock Plan under which the award was granted or any stock option,
employment, change of control, or other plan or agreement between the holder of the assumed option and LifeLock.

In addition, certain executive officers are eligible to receive accelerated vesting of up to 100% of the remaining unvested portion
of certain stock options under his or her employment agreement or the LifeLock, Inc. Severance Plan, as amended, which we refer to as
the “severance plan,” as applicable, in connection with an involuntary termination of employment other than for cause or if the
executive officer’s service is constructively terminated, each during a time frame that begins a specified period before and ends a
specified period after the effective time of the merger, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—
Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments upon Change in Control or Termination in
Connection with Change in Control.”

At the effective time of the merger, each option to purchase shares of common stock outstanding as of immediately before the
effective time of the merger, whether vested or unvested, that is held by an individual who is a non-employee director as of the closing
date of the merger and is outstanding as of immediately before the effective time of the merger, which we refer to as a “director
option,” will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive cash amount(s), without interest and subject to any
required tax withholdings, equal to the total number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise in full of such option multiplied
by the excess, if any, of the per share merger consideration over the applicable per share exercise price of such cancelled option.

Treatment of RSUs

As of November 15, 2016, there were 73,012 shares of common stock subject to outstanding restricted stock unit awards held by
our non-employee directors and 537,180 shares of common stock subject to outstanding restricted stock unit awards held by our
executive officers.

At the effective time of the merger, except with respect to any restricted stock units covering shares of common stock held by
non-employee directors, (1) the portion of each RSU outstanding and unsettled immediately before the effective time of the merger that
is vested as of the effective time of the merger; and (2) any portion of an RSU that by its terms accelerates vesting that is held by a
terminated service provider, which RSUs we refer to as the vested RSUs, will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to
receive cash amount(s), without interest and subject to any required tax withholdings, equal to the total number of shares of common
stock subject to the vested RSU multiplied by the per share merger consideration.

At the effective time of the merger, except with respect to any RSU held by a non-employee director, each unvested RSU will be
assumed by Symantec and automatically converted into an assumed RSU. Each assumed RSU will cover a number of shares of
Symantec common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock subject to the unvested RSU immediately before the effective
time of the merger, multiplied by the exchange ratio, with the resulting number rounded down to the nearest whole share. The assumed
RSUs also remain subject to any applicable provisions under the LifeLock Stock Plan under which the award was granted or any
restricted stock unit, employment, change of control or other plan or agreement between the holder of the assumed RSU and LifeLock.

In addition, certain executive officers are eligible to receive accelerated vesting of up to 100% of the remaining unvested portion
of certain RSUs under his or her employment agreement or the severance plan, as applicable, in connection with an involuntary
termination of employment other than for cause or if the executive officer is constructively terminated, each during a time frame that
begins a specified period before and ends a specified period after the merger, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments upon Change in Control or
Termination in Connection with Change in Control.”

At the effective time of the merger, each director RSU will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive cash
amount(s), without interest, equal to the total number of shares of common stock subject to the RSU multiplied by the per share merger
consideration.

Treatment of Restricted Stock

As of November 15, 2016, there were no shares of common stock subject to time-based RSAs held by our non-employee
directors and 458,293 shares of common stock subject to time-based RSAs held by our executive officers, excluding PRSAs. At the
effective time of the merger, each share of common stock subject to an RSA that is outstanding as of immediately before the effective
time of the merger will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive a cash amount, without interest and subject to
any required tax withholdings, equal to the per share merger consideration. Such cash payment will be retained by Symantec and will
become payable only upon the occurrence of the date that such RSAs would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place
for such RSAs immediately before or at the effective time of the merger (subject to the restrictions and other terms of such vesting
schedule and giving effect to any applicable agreement between the holder of such RSAs and Symantec).

In addition, certain executive officers are eligible to receive accelerated vesting of up to 100% of certain RSAs under his or her
employment agreement or the severance plan, as applicable, in connection with an involuntary termination of employment other than
for cause or if the executive officer is constructively terminated, each during a time frame that begins a specified period before and
ends a specified period after the

merger, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger—Payments upon Change in Control or Termination in Connection with Change in Control.”

Treatment of PRSAs

As of November 15, 2016, there were 76,922 shares of common stock subject to an outstanding PRSA (measured at the target
number of shares, or 115,384 at the maximum number of shares but subject to a cap of 99,998 shares upon the closing of the merger)
held by Ms. Schneider. None of the other executive officers or non-employee directors of LifeLock hold any PRSAs.

Ms. Schneider’s PRSA is subject to the following performance metrics: (1) a total of 23,076 shares of common stock (calculated
at the target level) are subject to achievement of a specified goal relating to total shareholder return, which we refer to as the “TSR
goal,” measured over a 2-year performance period scheduled to end in February 2018; (2) a total of 23,076 shares of common stock
(calculated at the target level) are subject to achievement of a specified TSR goal measured over a 3-year performance period
scheduled to end in February 2019; (3) a total of 15,385 shares of common stock (calculated at the target level) are subject to goals
relating to the achievement of LifeLock’s annual revenue achievement over LifeLock’s 2017 fiscal year (and certain other performance
goals); and (4) a total of 15,385 shares of common stock (calculated at the target level) are subject to goals relating to the achievement
of LifeLock’s annual revenue achievement over LifeLock’s 2018 fiscal year (and certain other performance goals).

The merger agreement provides that at the effective time of the merger, any PRSAs will be treated in accordance with the award
agreement, as amended, governing the PRSA and any employment, change of control, or other plan or agreement between the holder of
the PRSA and LifeLock.

PRSAs Subject to TSR Goals. Ms. Schneider’s PRSA agreement, as amended, provides that if Ms. Schneider remains an
employee of LifeLock through the closing of the merger, any ongoing performance period under the PRSA that is subject to the TSR
goal (which goal compares the TSR of LifeLock to the companies that comprise the NASDAQ Composite Index) will be shortened so
that each applicable performance period will end on the date of the change in control. The extent of achievement of the TSR goal will
be measured with respect to the shortened performance period, as certified by the Compensation Committee of the LifeLock Board.
The Compensation Committee of the LifeLock Board will certify LifeLock’s TSR percentile rank as compared to the companies
comprising the NASDAQ Composite Index and a specified number of shares of common stock (if any) will become eligible to vest
based on such performance, which shares we refer to as the “Eligible PRSAs.” In addition, on such date of certification, a number of
the Eligible PRSAs prorated based on the portion of the performance period that was completed through the change in control
compared to the original length of the 2- or 3-year performance period, as applicable, which we refer to as the “Prorated PRSAs,” will
be subject to accelerated vesting. The remaining Eligible PRSAs that do not so vest will be converted into time-based RSAs and will be
scheduled to vest in equal installments on a calendar quarter basis over the remainder of the original applicable performance period,
subject to Ms. Schneider remaining an employee through each respective vesting date. If a change in control occurs while Ms.
Schneider is an employee (or if Ms. Schneider is an employee during the three month period preceding a change in control, as
described below), any Eligible PRSAs that are not Prorated PRSAs will be eligible for accelerated vesting upon certain terminations of
employment to the extent provided in Ms. Schneider’s employment agreement with LifeLock, as described in more detail in the section
of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments upon Change
in Control or Termination in Connection with Change in Control.”

PRSAs Subject to Revenue Goals. Ms. Schneider’s PRSA agreement, as amended, also provides that if Ms. Schneider remains an
employee of LifeLock through the closing date of the merger and in light of the anticipated termination of employment of Ms.
Schneider upon the closing of the merger, the target number of shares subject to the performance goals that are based on the
achievement of LifeLock’s annual revenue for each of the 2017

and 2018 fiscal years under the PRSA, which is a total of 30,770 shares of common stock, will become vested as of the closing of the
merger.

Each share of common stock subject to any Prorated PRSAs will be converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to
receive a cash payment of the per share merger consideration and each share of common stock subject to an Eligible PRSA that
remains unvested and outstanding immediately before the effective time of the merger will be treated in the same manner as the time-
based RSAs, as described under the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards—Treatment of RSAs.”

Deferred RSUs

Each of our non-employee directors was eligible to defer payment of shares issuable to them upon the vesting of RSUs that were
granted to him or her on May 5, 2016, referred to as the “May 2016 RSUs,” until the earlier of a date selected by the director or the
director’s cessation of service on the LifeLock Board (and service to LifeLock in general). If such an election was made, the vested
shares subject to the May 2016 RSUs will be paid to the director and be taxable to the director in the year specified by the director or
the year the director ceases to be a member of the LifeLock Board, as elected by the director, unless a change in control of LifeLock
occurs earlier (which the merger will constitute), in which case the RSUs will be paid in connection with the change in control.
Accordingly, any shares that were so deferred under the May 2016 RSUs will become payable as a result of the closing of the merger
and will be converted at the effective time into the right to receive a cash payment of the per share merger consideration.

Equity Interests of LifeLock’s Executive Officers and Non-employee Directors

The following table sets forth the number of shares of common stock and the number of shares of common stock underlying
equity awards held by each of LifeLock’s executive officers and non-employee directors outstanding as of the closing of the merger,
assuming that such closing occurs on February 1, 2017. Except as noted below, the numbers do not forecast any future grants, exercises
or forfeitures that may occur between November 15, 2016, and February 1, 2017, and the forecasts of the number of shares and equity
awards that will be outstanding on February 1, 2017, are based on the shares and equity awards held as of November 15, 2016, with the
vesting of such awards updated as of February 1, 2017.

(1) Includes the number of shares of common stock directly held by the individual as of November 15, 2016, plus the number of

shares of common stock that are subject to RSUs that are scheduled to vest and be settled, and RSAs that are scheduled to vest,
between the date of the merger agreement and February 1, 2017. The options held by Mr. Power are scheduled to expire before
February 1, 2017, if not exercised prior to such date, and have a per share exercise price less than the per share merger
consideration. Accordingly, such options are assumed to be exercised in full prior to their expiration, and the exercised option
shares are reflected in this column. However, the amounts do not take into account any shares of common stock that may be used
to satisfy any tax withholding obligations with respect to any equity awards. The number of shares shown does not include shares
that the executive officer may purchase after the date of the merger agreement under the ESPP. The number of shares held by
Mr. Cowan also includes (1) 153,413 shares held by Cowan Family Trust UDT dated 10-17-02; and (2) 389,303 shares held by

(3) Includes the number of unvested shares of common stock subject to LifeLock stock options that are expected to be held by the
individual on February 1, 2017. Such unvested options held by the executive officers will be assumed by Symantec at the
effective time and such unvested options held by non-employee directors will be cancelled at the effective time in exchange for
the right to receive cash with respect to such cancelled options.

(4) Includes the number of shares of common stock subject to restricted stock units expected to be held by the individual on February
1, 2017, including any vested shares of common stock subject to restricted stock units that are expected not to have been settled
by February 1, 2017 (including any vested shares that were deferred under the May 2016 RSUs). Six thousand six hundred thirty-
eight shares of common stock underlying the restricted stock units held by each of the non-employee directors other than
Mr. Ridge will have become vested before February 1, 2017, but not yet settled as of such date. Each RSU held by a non-
employee director and any vested RSUs held by the executive officers will be cancelled at the effective time in exchange for a
cash payment, on a per share basis, equal to the per share merger consideration ($24.00), subject to any applicable tax
withholdings. Any unvested RSUs held by executive officers will be assumed by Symantec at the effective time of the merger
agreement. Any RSUs that are scheduled to vest and be settled prior to February 1, 2017, are not included in this column and
instead are included in the “Number of Shares” column.

(5) Includes the number of shares of common stock subject to RSAs that are expected to be held by the individual on February 1,
2017, including the PRSA held by Ms. Schneider. Any RSAs that are scheduled to vest by February 1, 2017, are not included in
this column and instead are included in the “Number of Shares” column. Each RSA will be converted into the right to receive a
cash payment, on a per share basis, equal to the per share merger consideration ($24.00), subject to any applicable tax
withholdings, paid upon and subject to the original vesting schedule applicable to such RSAs.

Includes 99,998 shares of common stock subject to the PRSA held by Ms. Schneider, assuming (i) achievement of the TSR goals
at the maximum levels, resulting in 69,228 shares of common stock subject to the PRSA that are subject to such TSR goals could
become eligible to vest, with 26,442 of such shares could vest at the effective time of the merger upon certification of
performance against the TSR goals and 42,786 of such shares could convert into time-based RSAs, and (ii) the target number of
shares of common stock subject to the PRSA that is subject to the achievement of performance goals relating to LifeLock’s
revenue for LifeLock’s fiscal years 2017 and 2018 vesting as of the closing of the merger, resulting in 30,770 shares of common
stock vesting with respect to such portion of the PRSA. Each share subject to the PRSA that is vested as of the closing of the
merger will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment, on a per share basis, equal to the per share merger consideration
($24.00), subject to any applicable tax withholdings. Each share subject to the PRSA that converts to a time-based RSA that has
not vested as of the closing of the merger will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment, on a per share basis, equal to
the per share merger consideration ($24.00), subject to any applicable tax withholdings, paid upon and subject to the vesting
schedule applicable to such shares.

Payments Upon Change in Control or Termination in Connection with Change in Control

Hilary Schneider, Todd Davis, Douglas Jeffries, and Sharon Segev

We entered into employment agreements, as amended, with each of Hilary Schneider, Todd Davis, Douglas Jeffries, and Sharon
Segev, which we refer to as the “executive agreements.”

Each executive agreement provides for certain severance benefits in the event that the applicable executive officer’s employment
is terminated by us without “cause” or the applicable executive officer terminates his or her employment due to a “constructive
termination” (as each is defined in the applicable executive agreement and described generally below). In such an event, Ms.
Schneider, Mr. Davis, Mr. Jeffries, and Ms. Segev, respectively, subject to an effective release in our favor, will receive continuing,
monthly payments of the executive officer’s base salary as in effect on the date of termination of his or her employment (referred to as
“salary severance”) and a lump sum cash payment, generally payable on the first payroll date following the effectiveness of the release
of claims as described further below, based on a multiple of the monthly COBRA premium that would be necessary to continue group
insurance coverage under our plans (referred to as the “COBRA premium”) in the following amounts: for Ms. Schneider, 18 months of
salary severance and 36 times her COBRA premium for Mr. Davis, 18 months of salary

severance and 36 times his COBRA premium for Mr. Jeffries, 12 months of salary severance and 24 times his COBRA premium and
for Ms. Segev, 12 months of salary severance and 24 times her COBRA premium.

Each executive agreement further provides that, in the event that, during the period beginning 3 months prior to our “change in
control” (as defined in the employment agreements, described generally below, and which the merger constitutes), and ending 18
months following such change in control, which period we refer to as “change in control period,” the applicable executive officer’s
employment is terminated by us without cause or the applicable executive officer terminates his or her employment due to a
constructive termination, then, subject to an effective release in our favor, in addition to the payments described above, the applicable
executive officer will receive 100% of his or her annualized target bonus under the applicable bonus plan for the performance period in
which the employment termination occurs or, with respect to Ms. Schneider, Mr. Jeffries and Ms. Segev, if greater, the target bonus in
effect for the performance period in which our change in control occurs, with such payment to be made generally on the first payroll
date following the effectiveness of the release of claims. In addition, we have from time to time granted Ms. Schneider, Mr. Davis,
Mr. Jeffries, and Ms. Segev, individually, equity awards under the LifeLock Stock Plans. Each of the executive agreements provides
that if we terminate the employment of the executive officer without cause or the executive officer terminates his or her employment
due to a constructive termination during the change in control period, then, subject to an effective release in our favor, his or her
unvested and outstanding time-based equity awards (including, for Ms. Schneider, any PRSAs that have been converted into
time-based RSAs) will become 100% vested (and fully exercisable, as applicable).

With respect to Ms. Segev, assuming that the closing of the merger occurs on February 1, 2017, and as of the same date, her
employment is terminated under circumstances that would entitle her to severance payments under her executive agreement, the cash-
based severance and COBRA premium benefits described above would include: $350,000 of salary severance, $175,000 in target
bonus severance, $36,667 of COBRA premium severance and acceleration of all unvested equity awards held by Ms. Segev as of the
date of termination of her employment. The severance benefits with respect to the other executive officers are set forth in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute
Compensation.”

The severance benefits under each of the executive agreements are conditioned on the applicable executive officer executing and
not revoking a release of claims in our favor. Additionally, the severance benefits under the executive agreements for Ms. Schneider
and Mr. Davis are conditioned on the executive officer refraining from certain restricted activities for a period of 18 months following
employment termination, and the severance benefits under Mr. Davis’ executive agreement are conditioned on his compliance with
non-solicitation requirements, for a period of 18 months following employment termination.

Each executive agreement further provides that, in the event that the benefits provided under the executive agreement or
otherwise payable to the executive officer would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (referred to as the “Code”) and would be subject to an excise tax under Code Section 4999, then
the benefits will be either reduced by an amount so that no portion of the benefits are subject to the excise tax, or not reduced by any
amount, whichever would result in the greater amount of net after-tax benefits to the executive officer.

Chris G. Power

We entered into an amended and restated employment agreement (referred to as his “employment agreement”) with Chris G.
Power on March 7, 2016. Mr. Power’s last day of service with us was October 30, 2016. We entered into a transition agreement and
release of claims with Mr. Power on November 8, 2016 and Mr. Power will not be entitled to any cash severance upon or in connection
with the merger.

Table of Contents

We have from time to time granted Mr. Power equity awards under our incentive compensation plans. Mr. Power’s equity award
agreements provide that the equity awards will accelerate vesting in full in the event that, during the period beginning 2 months prior to
and ending 12 months following our “change in control” (which the merger constitutes), we terminate Mr. Power’s employment
without “cause” (as each are defined in the LifeLock Stock Plan governing the applicable award and described generally below) or
Mr. Power terminates his employment due to a “constructive termination” (as defined in his applicable award agreements and
described generally below). Mr. Power’s service with us terminated prior to the merger in a manner that does not trigger any vesting
acceleration of his equity awards.

Ty Shay

Mr. Shay, our Chief Marketing Officer, is a participant in our severance plan pursuant to a participation agreement entered into
between Mr. Shay and us. Under the severance plan, in the event Mr. Shay terminates his employment with us due to a “constructive
termination,” or we terminate Mr. Shay’s employment for a reason other than “cause” and other than Mr. Shay’s death or disability
(which we refer to in each case as a “qualifying termination” and as each such term is defined in the severance plan) outside of the
“change in control period” (which is the period beginning 3 months before through 18 months after our change in control, and which
the merger constitutes), Mr. Shay, subject to an effective release in our favor, will be entitled to receive, generally on or commencing
with the first payroll date following the effectiveness of the release, (1) continuing payments of 9 months of his base salary in effect
immediately before the date of termination of his employment, and (2) a lump sum cash payment equal to 18 times his COBRA
premium. In the event such qualifying termination of Mr. Shay employment occurs during the change in control period, Mr. Shay
instead will receive, generally on or commencing with the first payroll date following the effectiveness of the release, (1) continuing
payments of 12 months of his base salary in effect immediately before the date of termination of his employment, provided that the
base salary amount will be no less than as in effect immediately before the change in control period, (2) a lump sum cash payment
equal to 24 times his COBRA premium, (3) a lump sum cash payment equal to 100% of his target bonus for the performance period in
which the qualifying termination occurs or if greater, the target bonus for the year in which our change in control occurs, and (4) 100%
acceleration of all unvested, time-based equity awards. The severance plan provides that in order to receive these separation benefits,
Mr. Shay must sign and not revoke a separation and release of claims agreement in a form reasonably satisfactory to us and continue to
comply with the terms of any confidentiality, proprietary rights and non-solicitation agreement, and any other agreements with us under
which he may have a material duty or obligation to us, including the terms of any confidentiality, proprietary rights and non-solicitation
agreement, and any other written agreement or agreements between Mr. Shay and LifeLock. His proprietary rights and non-solicitation
agreement provides that he will not use LifeLock confidential or proprietary information to induce any LifeLock employee to end his
or her employment with LifeLock. Under such agreement, Mr. Shay also is subject to a non-disparagement obligation, and
confidentiality obligation with respect to LifeLock’s proprietary information and certain other confidential information, in each case
during and following his employment with LifeLock. The severance plan further provides that, in the event that the benefits provided
under the severance plan or otherwise payable to the participant would constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Code
Section 280G and would be subject to an excise tax under Code Section 4999, then the benefits will be either reduced by an amount so
that no portion of the benefits are subject to the excise tax, or not reduced by any amount, whichever would result in the greater amount
of net after-tax benefits to the participant.

Prior to becoming a participant under the severance plan, Mr. Shay entered into a severance agreement with us. The severance
agreement provides that in the event Mr. Shay’s employment is terminated by us without “cause” (as defined in the severance
agreement), Mr. Shay would receive continued payments of salary in effect at the time of employment termination for a period of
6 months following employment termination, conditioned on his executing a release of claims in our favor, which payments generally
are payable commencing on the first payroll date following the effectiveness of the release of claims. However, the severance plan
provides that in the event that a participant of the severance plan becomes entitled to severance benefits under any other plan, program,
arrangement, offer letter or employment agreement with us, that are duplicative to those provided under

the severance plan, then the participant will receive the severance benefits under the severance plan or such other arrangement,
whichever provides for the greater benefit to prevent duplication. Accordingly, in the event Mr. Shay becomes entitled to receive
severance benefits under the severance plan, he will not receive the severance benefits set forth under his severance agreement.

Certain Definitions

Under the executive agreements, Mr. Power’s unvested equity awards granted under the 2012 Plan, the severance agreement, and
the severance plan described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger—Payments Upon Change in Control or Termination in Connection with Change in Control,” the term “cause” is
defined as (1) an act or acts of personal dishonesty, fraud, or embezzlement by the executive officer; (2) a demonstrably willful and
deliberate violation by the executive officer of his or her obligations under his or her executive agreement, if applicable, employment
agreement or offer letter, his or her proprietary rights agreement or other applicable agreement with LifeLock, that is not remedied in a
reasonable period of time after receipt of written notice from LifeLock; (3) any willful or deliberate refusal to follow the requests or
instructions of the LifeLock Board or our Chief Executive Officer, or, in the case of Mr. Shay, his direct supervisor, that are not
remedied in a reasonable period of time after receipt of written notice from LifeLock; (4) the conviction of the executive officer for any
criminal act that is a felony or that is a crime involving acts of personal dishonesty causing material harm to the standing and reputation
of LifeLock; or (5) with respect to Ms. Segev, the loss, revocation, or suspension of her license to practice law in any state in which she
is presently or may in the future be licensed to practice, other than short-term suspension for non-payment of license fees or other
similar procedural reasons or her voluntary withdrawal of the executive officer’s license to practice law in any state.

Under the executive agreements, Mr. Power’s employment agreement and award agreements, and the severance plan with respect
to Mr. Shay described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in
the Merger—Payments Upon Change in Control or Termination in Connection with Change in Control,” the term “constructive
termination” is defined as (1) LifeLock’s material breach of the material terms and conditions required to be complied with by
LifeLock pursuant to an applicable agreement; (2) a material diminution in the executive officer’s title, duties, or responsibilities; or (3)
except in the case of Mr. Power’s employment agreement and award agreements, a relocation of the executive officer’s principal work
site by more than 50 miles.

Under the executive agreements, severance plan and our 2012 Incentive Compensation Plan described under this section titled
“Payments Upon Change in Control or Termination in Connection with Change in Control,” the term “change in control” refers to (1)
acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of more than 50% of either the value of the equity securities of LifeLock or voting
power of the voting securities of LifeLock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, excluding any acquisition directly from
LifeLock, by LifeLock, by a person who has a controlling beneficial ownership of LifeLock, by LifeLock’s or its affiliate’s employee
benefit plans, or by an entity referenced in clauses (3)(i) through (iii) below; (2) the incumbent members of the Board, which includes
any individual who becomes a director with approval by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the incumbent
Board members during any period of two years ceasing to constitute at least a majority of the Board; (3) completion of a
reorganization, merger, statutory share exchange, or consolidation or similar transaction involving LifeLock or any of its subsidiaries,
but in the case of any subsidiaries, only if equity securities of LifeLock are issued or issuable in connection with the transaction; or a
sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of LifeLock, or the acquisition of assets or equity of another entity by
LifeLock or any of its subsidiaries, unless following such transaction, (i) all or substantially all of the beneficial owners of LifeLock’s
stock immediately prior to the transaction beneficially own more than 50% of the value of the outstanding securities and voting power
of securities entitled to vote in the election of Board members in substantially the same proportion as immediately prior to the
transaction, (ii) no person of LifeLock, the continuing entity following the transaction, any entity controlled by the continuing entity or
any person that had beneficial ownership of a controlling interest in LifeLock when the 2012 Incentive Compensation

Plan became effective, beneficially owns at least 50% of the value or voting power of the continuing entity following the transaction
(unless such ownership existed prior to the transaction), and (iii) at least a majority of the Board members of the continuing entity
following the transaction were incumbent directors at the time of execution of the transaction agreement or Board action providing for
the transaction; or (4) approval by LifeLock’s stockholders of a complete liquidation or dissolution of LifeLock. The merger is
considered a change in control under this definition.

Employment Arrangements Following the Merger

As of the date of this proxy statement, none of LifeLock’s executive officers have reached an understanding on potential
employment or other retention terms with the surviving corporation or with Symantec, and no LifeLock executive officers have entered
into any definitive agreements or arrangements regarding employment or other retention with the surviving corporation or with
Symantec following the consummation of the merger. However, prior to the effective time of the merger, Symantec may initiate
discussions regarding employment or other retention terms and may enter into definitive agreements regarding employment or
retention for certain of LifeLock’s employees, to be effective as of the effective time of the merger. In addition, as disclosed in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Employee Benefits,” Symantec has agreed to assume the
obligations and succeed to the rights of LifeLock under each of the Change of Control and Severance Agreements with LifeLock’s
current executive officers.

Symantec has informed LifeLock that it does not intend to retain Ms. Schneider and Mr. Davis after the closing of the merger and
that their employment with LifeLock will be terminated at the closing of the merger.

Golden Parachute Compensation

In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or that otherwise
relates to the merger that will or may become payable to each of our named executive officers in connection with the merger. For
further information regarding this compensation, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

LifeLock’s “named executive officers” for purposes of the disclosure in this proxy statement are Todd Davis, Hilary Schneider,
Chris Power, Schwark Satyavolu, Ty Shay, and Douglas Jeffries. Mr. Jeffries was not a named executive officer of LifeLock under the
definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC for LifeLock’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2015; however, during 2016, he became,
and currently serves as, LifeLock’s Chief Financial Officer.

Table of Contents

The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K published by the SEC regarding certain
compensation that each of LifeLock’s named executive officers may receive that is based on, or that otherwise relates to, the merger.
The figures in the table are estimated based on (1) compensation and benefit levels as of November 15, 2016; (2) an assumed effective
date of February 1, 2017, for the merger; (3) the termination of the named executive officer’s employment without cause at the
effective time of the merger; and (4) that each named executive officer’s equity awards held on November 15, 2016, will equal the
equity awards held by such named executive officer on February 1, 2017 (after taking into account any vesting that is scheduled to
occur between November 15, 2016 and February 1, 2017). The amounts reported below are estimates based on multiple assumptions
that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including an assumption that the employment of each of
LifeLock’s named executive officers will be terminated without cause at the effective time of the merger. As required by applicable
SEC rules, all amounts below that are determined using the per share value of common stock have been calculated based on a per share
price of $24.00 (the per share merger consideration).

(1) As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the

Merger—Payments upon Change in Control or Termination in Connection with Change in Control,” under the executive
agreements with respect to Mr. Davis, Ms. Schneider, and Mr. Jeffries or the severance plan and participation agreement with
respect to Mr. Shay, upon a termination of the named executive officer’s employment by LifeLock without cause or a constructive
termination by the named executive officer, in each case during the change in control period, the named executive officer would
be entitled to (1) continuing payments of his or her base salary for 12 months (or 18 months for Mr. Davis and Ms. Schneider);
and (2) a lump sum payment equal to 100% of the greater of the named executive officer’s (a) target bonus as in effect for the year
in which the change in control occurs, or (b) target bonus as in effect for the year in which the termination of employment occurs
(except with respect to Mr. Davis, whose target bonus is a specified amount under his employment agreement and set forth in the
table below). All such amounts are “double-trigger” and only get paid if the executive officer’s employment is terminated under
the circumstances described within the change in control period.

The following table quantifies each separate form of cash severance reported in this column in the table to which this footnote
relates.

will receive any enhanced or additional cash payments in connection with the merger.

(2) Represents the aggregate payments to be made in respect of unvested options, unvested restricted stock units, unvested RSAs and
unvested PRSAs that will be subject to accelerated vesting upon either the closing of the merger or a qualifying termination of
employment in connection with the merger, as described in further detail in footnotes (3) and (4) below. The value of each share
of common stock underlying an option is determined as the excess, if any, of $24.00 (the per share merger consideration) over the
per share exercise price of the option. The value of each share of common stock underlying any RSU, RSA, or PRSA is based on
the per share merger consideration of $24.00.

(3) As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards,” a portion of the PRSA held by Ms. Schneider that is outstanding as of the closing
of the merger will vest or become eligible to vest as follows. The portion of the PRSA that is subject in part to the achievement of
performance goals relating to LifeLock’s revenue for each of LifeLock’s fiscal years 2017 and 2018, shall vest upon, and subject
to the occurrence of the closing of the merger, at the target levels, which portion is equal to 30,770 shares of common stock
underlying the PRSA.

The remaining portion of the PRSA which is subject to the achievement of TSR goals will have the applicable performance
periods shortened as of the closing of the merger and actual performance measured against the applicable TSR goal. Upon
certification of performance against the TSR goals, a prorated portion of the shares of common stock underlying the PRSA that
become eligible to vest based on such actual performance shall become vested, with the proration determined based on the extent
to which the applicable performance period was completed through the closing of the merger (disregarding for purposes of
proration the shortening of the performance periods), and any remaining shares of common stock subject to the PRSA that
become eligible to vest based on actual performance against the applicable TSR goal will be converted into time-based RSAs
scheduled to vest in equal installments on a quarterly calendar basis over the remainder of the original applicable performance
period (with RSAs to be treated as other RSAs are treated in the merger generally). Solely for the purposes of the estimates shown
in the table to which this footnote relates, it is assumed that the applicable TSR goals will be achieved at the maximum levels as
of the closing of the merger, resulting in 69,228 shares of common stock underlying the PRSA that are subject to the achievement
of the TSR goals becoming eligible to vest, with 26,442 of such shares vesting upon certification of performance against the TSR
goals and 42,786 shares being converted into time-based RSAs.

The following table quantifies the value of the shares of common stock underlying the PRSA that accelerate vesting upon the
closing of the merger, based on the foregoing assumptions in this footnote as well as footnote (2) above. All such amounts are
“single-trigger” in nature (which means that payment is conditioned on the closing of the merger but not on any qualifying
termination of employment), except that the portion of the PRSA that is subject to the TSR goals will be eligible for such vesting
only to the extent that the applicable TSR goals are achieved based on actual performance during the applicable performance
period through and ending on the closing date of the merger; provided, however, that to the extent that Ms. Schneider’s
employment is terminated by LifeLock without cause or by her due to a constructive termination, in each case during the change
in control period but prior to our change in control, then the accelerated vesting will occur only if our change in control occurs
within the three-month period following such termination of employment, which in such limited circumstance will be considered
“double trigger.” The PRSAs that are converted into time-based RSAs always will be considered “double trigger” and are not
included in the table below.

Table of Contents

(4) As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger—Payments upon Change in Control or Termination in Connection with Change in Control,” under the executive
agreements with respect to Mr. Davis, Ms. Schneider, and Mr. Jeffries or the severance plan and participation agreement with
respect to Mr. Shay, all of the equity awards that are subject to time-based vesting would accelerate vesting in full upon a
termination of the named executive officer’s employment by LifeLock without cause or a constructive termination by the named
executive officer, in each case that occurs during the change in control period. Such vesting acceleration with respect to
Ms. Schneider will apply to any unvested portion of her PRSA that converts into a time-based RSA and becomes eligible to vest
based on continued employment following the closing of the merger as described in footnote (3) above and further described in
the section of this proxy captioned “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of
Equity-Based Awards.” The following table quantifies the value of the equity awards that would accelerate upon a termination of
the named executive officer’s employment by LifeLock without cause or a constructive termination by the named executive
officer, in each case during the change in control period (assuming for this purpose that the termination occurs on the closing of
the merger). All such amounts are “double-trigger.” In addition, for purposes of the table below, the number of shares of common
stock underlying the PRSA includes the portion of the PRSA that were subject to “single-trigger” acceleration under footnote (3)
above. Solely for the purposes of the estimates shown in the table to which this footnote relates, it is assumed that the applicable
TSR goals will be achieved at the maximum levels as of the closing of the merger. See footnote (2) above for additional

(5) As described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger—Payments upon Change in Control or Termination in Connection with Change in Control,” under the executive
agreements with respect to Mr. Davis, Ms. Schneider, and Mr. Jeffries or severance plan and participation agreement with respect
to Mr. Shay, amounts represent a lump sum payment equal to the named executive officer’s applicable monthly COBRA
premium, multiplied by: 36, for Mr. Davis and Ms. Schneider and 24, for Messrs. Jeffries and Shay. All such amounts are
“double-trigger.” Mr. Power’s and Mr. Satyavolu’s service with us ended as described further in footnotes (6) and (7). Mr. Power
received certain cash payments in connection with such termination. However, neither of these individuals will receive enhanced
cash severance benefits or additional cash payments in connection with the merger.

(6) As noted above, pursuant to the executive agreements and severance plan, in the event that any payments to the named executive
officers would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (as a result of such payments being classified as
parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code), then the benefits payable to any such named executive officers will be
either reduced by an amount so that no portion of the benefits are subject to the excise tax, or not reduced by any amount,
whichever would result in the greater amount of net after-tax benefits to the named executive officer. The total amounts do not
reflect any such reductions to “parachute payments” under Section 280G that may be economically beneficial to the named
executive officer in order to avoid the imposition of the excise tax. A definitive analysis will depend on the date of the effective
time, the date of the termination of the named executive officer’s employment (if any), whether any such termination occurs
during the change in control period, and certain other assumptions.

(7) Mr. Power’s service with us ended effective October 30, 2016. However, the award agreements that govern his equity awards that
were unvested at the time of termination of his services with us provide that the awards will accelerate vesting in full in the event
that, during the period beginning 2 months prior to and ending 12 months following our change in control (which the merger
constitutes), we terminate Mr. Power’s employment without “cause” (as each are defined in the LifeLock Stock Plan governing
the applicable award) or Mr. Power terminates his employment due to a “constructive termination” (as defined in his applicable
award agreements). As a result, in the event that the closing of the merger occurs on or before December 30, 2016, a total of
171,923 shares of common stock subject to his options with a total value of $1,846,739 (based on the $24.00 per share merger
consideration less any per share exercise price) would accelerate vesting, a total of 86,404 shares of common stock subject to his
RSUs with a total value of $2,073,696 (based on the $24.00 per share merger consideration) would accelerate vesting, and a total
of 51,347 shares of common stock subject to his RSAs with a total value of $1,232,328 (based on the $24.00 per share merger
consideration) would accelerate vesting. The treatment of Mr. Power’s equity awards is further described in the section of this
proxy captioned “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards”
and “—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Payments upon Change in Control or
Termination in Connection with Change in Control.”

(8) Mr. Satyavolu’s service with us ended effective September 30, 2016, and he is not entitled to any vesting acceleration, severance
benefits, or other change in control payments in connection with the merger.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

The closing of the merger will take place no later than the second business day following the satisfaction or waiver in accordance
with the merger agreement of all of the conditions to closing of the merger (as described under the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger”), other than conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of such conditions.

Appraisal Rights

If the merger is consummated, LifeLock stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, who
properly demand appraisal of their shares, who continuously hold such shares through the effective time of the merger and who
otherwise comply with the procedures of Section 262 of the DGCL (including with respect to certain aggregate ownership
requirements) will, subject to the conditions thereof, be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of
the DGCL, which we refer to as “Section 262.” Unless the context requires otherwise, all references in Section 262 of the DGCL and
in this summary to a “stockholder” are to a record holder of common stock.

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in
its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. The following summary does not
constitute any legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that LifeLock stockholders exercise their appraisal rights
under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in
that holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of common stock held of record in the name of another person, such
as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below properly and in
a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or other
nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or other nominee.

Under Section 262, holders of shares of common stock who (1) submit a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s
shares to LifeLock prior to the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement nor consented thereto in writing; (3) continuously are the record

Table of Contents

holders of such shares through the effective time of the merger; and (4) otherwise follow the procedures set forth in Section 262 may be
entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the
shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together
with interest to be paid on the amount determined to be the fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.
However, after an appraisal petition has been filed, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all
LifeLock stockholders who asserted appraisal rights unless (a) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 or (b) the value of the merger
consideration in respect of such shares exceeds $1 million. We refer to these conditions as the “ownership thresholds.” Unless the
Delaware Court of Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue
and compound quarterly from the effective time of the merger through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period; provided, however, that at any time before
the Delaware Court of Chancery enters judgment in the appraisal proceeding, the surviving corporation may pay to each LifeLock
stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case any such interest will accrue after the time of such payment only on
the amount that equals the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the “fair value” of the shares as determined
by the Court of Chancery and (2) any interest accrued prior to the time of such voluntary payment, unless paid at such time. The
surviving corporation is under no obligation to make such voluntary cash payment prior to such entry of judgment.

Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not
less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available
and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes LifeLock’s notice to stockholders that appraisal rights
are available in connection with the merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C. In
connection with the merger, any holder of shares of common stock who wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve
such holder’s right to do so, should review Annex C carefully. Failure to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 262 in a
timely and proper manner may result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A LifeLock stockholder who loses his, her or its
appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration described in the merger agreement. Moreover, because of the
complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of common stock, LifeLock believes that if a LifeLock
stockholder considers exercising such rights, that stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.

LifeLock stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must do ALL of the
following:
 

 •  the stockholder must not vote in favor of or consent to the adoption of the merger agreement;
 

 
•  the stockholder must deliver to LifeLock a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger agreement at the

special meeting;
 

 
•  the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective time of the

merger (a LifeLock stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the effective time of
the merger); and

 

 
•  a stockholder or the surviving company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of

the fair value of the shares within 120 days after the effective time of the merger. The surviving company is under no
obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.

In addition, one of the ownership thresholds must be met.

Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the merger agreement, a
LifeLock stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the merger
agreement, abstain or not vote its shares.

Table of Contents

Filing Written Demand

Any holder of shares of common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to LifeLock, before the vote on the
adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting at which the adoption of the merger agreement will be submitted to the
stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder must not vote, in person or by proxy,
in favor of or consent to the adoption of the merger agreement. A holder of shares of common stock exercising appraisal rights must
hold of record the shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through
the effective time of the merger. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in
favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a waiver of the LifeLock stockholder’s right of appraisal and will
nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a LifeLock stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes
to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or abstain
from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement nor abstaining from
voting or failing to vote on the adoption of the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal
satisfying the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or
vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. A proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger agreement will not constitute a
demand. A LifeLock stockholder’s failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger
agreement at the special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder’s
name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and
must reasonably inform LifeLock of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the
holder’s shares in connection with the merger. If the shares are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or
custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one
person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized
agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record;
however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting
as agent for the record owner or owners.

LIFELOCK STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER
NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BANK,
BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BANK,
BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A
BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK,
BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY
AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

LifeLock, Inc.
60 East Rio Salado Parkway, Suite 400

Tempe, Arizona 85281
Attention: Secretary

Any holder of shares of common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered
pursuant to the merger agreement by delivering to LifeLock a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such
attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the

effective time of the merger will require written approval of the surviving corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal
proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that this shall not
affect the right of any LifeLock stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named
party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration within 60 days after the effective
time of the merger.

Notice by the Surviving Corporation

If the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify each holder
of shares of common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of or
consented to the adoption of the merger agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of shares of
common stock who has complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal
proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a
petition filed by a LifeLock stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all LifeLock stockholders
entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and holders
should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the
shares of common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate
all necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of common stock within the time and in the manner
prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a holder of common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262
could nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.

Within 120 days after the effective time of the merger, any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with the
requirements for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a
statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to
which LifeLock has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. The surviving corporation
must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within
10 days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares held
either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or
request from the surviving corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made
by a LifeLock stockholder of record.

If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving
corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in
Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all LifeLock stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by
the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those LifeLock stockholders
who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware Court of Chancery
may require the LifeLock stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in
Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction,
the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.

Table of Contents

The Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all LifeLock stockholders who assert appraisal rights
unless (a) the total number of shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares
of common stock as measured in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 262 or (b) the value of the merger consideration in respect
of the shares for which appraisal rights have been pursued and perfected exceeds $1 million.

Determination of Fair Value

After determining the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, and that at least one of the ownership thresholds above has
been satisfied in respect of the LifeLock stockholders seeking appraisal rights, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in
accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such
proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the “fair value” of the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount
determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors.
Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the
date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including
any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of
the judgment. However, the surviving corporation has the right, at any point prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery’s entry of
judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each LifeLock stockholder seeking appraisal. If the surviving
corporation makes a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum
of (i) the difference, if any, between the amount paid by the surviving corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of
the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (ii) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid
at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining
fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered
acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be considered, and that “[f]air price obviously
requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making
this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value, dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the
enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on future prospects of the
merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow
exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value
arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future
value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product
of speculation, may be considered.”

LifeLock stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger
if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point
of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under
Section 262 of the DGCL. Although LifeLock believes that the per share merger consideration is fair, no representation is made
as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and LifeLock stockholders
should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the per
share merger consideration. Neither LifeLock nor Symantec anticipates offering more than the per share merger consideration to any
LifeLock stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and each of LifeLock and Symantec reserves the right to make a voluntary cash
payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair
value” of

Table of Contents

a share of common stock is less than the per share merger consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, or if neither of the
ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the LifeLock stockholders seeking appraisal rights, then the right to an
appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and expenses of experts)
may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable
under the circumstances. Upon application of a LifeLock stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a
portion of the expenses incurred by any LifeLock stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.

If any LifeLock stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect,
or loses or successfully withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, the stockholder’s shares of common stock will be deemed to have
been converted at the effective time of the merger into the right to receive the per share merger consideration. A LifeLock stockholder
will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days
after the effective time of the merger, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the LifeLock
stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the holder’s
demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the per share merger consideration in accordance with Section 262.

From and after the effective time of the merger, no LifeLock stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to
vote such shares of common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except
dividends or other distributions on the holder’s shares of common stock, if any, payable to LifeLock stockholders as of a time prior to
the effective time of the merger. If no petition for an appraisal is filed within the time provided in Section 262, if neither of the
ownership thresholds above has been satisfied in respect of the LifeLock stockholders seeking appraisal rights or if the stockholder
delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger, either within
60 days after the effective time of the merger or thereafter with the written approval of the surviving corporation, then the right of such
LifeLock stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however,
the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any LifeLock stockholder who commenced the proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party without the approval of the court.

Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a LifeLock stockholder’s
statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any LifeLock stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal
counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

Accounting Treatment

The merger will be accounted for as a “purchase transaction” for financial accounting purposes.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following discussion is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that may be relevant to
U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of common stock whose shares are converted into the right to
receive cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, court
decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the “IRS,” and other applicable authorities, all as
in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive
effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment purposes).

Table of Contents

This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in
light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:
 

 

•  tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax
laws, such as financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S corporations or any other entities or arrangements treated as
partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes; insurance companies; mutual funds; dealers in
stocks and securities; traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities;
regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules; or certain
former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

 

 
•  tax consequences to holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk

reduction transaction;
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders who received their shares of common stock in a compensatory transaction or pursuant to the

exercise of options or warrants;
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Symantec or the surviving corporation

following the merger;
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders who hold their shares of common stock as “qualified small business stock” for purposes of

Sections 1045 and/or 1202 of the Code;
 

 •  tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders who hold their common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity, or a branch

thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders who are “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies” or “personal

holding companies” for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 •  tax consequences arising from the Medicare tax on net investment income;
 

 •  U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any;
 

 •  any state, local or foreign tax consequences; or
 

 
•  tax consequences to holders that do not vote in favor of the merger nor consent thereto in writing and who have properly and

validly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights under the DGCL.

If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of common stock, then the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend
upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. Partnerships holding shares of common stock and
partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the merger.

No ruling has been or will be obtained from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger described
below. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would ultimately prevail in a final
determination by a court.

THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL
ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S.
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER FEDERAL NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE
LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.

•  a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any

state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 

 •  an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 

 
•  a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United

States persons as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) that has a valid election in effect under applicable
Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the
amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. A U.S. Holder’s
adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be capital gain or
loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of
the completion of the merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S.
Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Non-U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of shares of common stock that is neither a
U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Special rules not discussed below may apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders subject to special tax treatment such as “controlled
foreign corporations” or “passive foreign investment companies.” Non-U.S. Holders (and investors therein) should consult their own
tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax consequences that may be relevant to them in light of their
particular circumstances.

Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
 

 

•  the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by
an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the
United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to
U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of
30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);

 

 
•  such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the

merger, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a
rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty); or

 

 

•  LifeLock is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of the
Code, which we refer to as a “USRPHC,” at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the merger or such
Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable shares of common stock, which we refer to as the “relevant
period,” and, if shares of common stock are regularly traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owns directly or is deemed to own pursuant to attribution rules more
than 5% of our common stock at any time during the relevant period, in which

case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the
first bullet point above), except that the branch profits tax will not apply. We believe that we are not, and have not been, a
USRPHC at any time during the five-year period preceding the merger.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Information reporting and backup withholding (at a rate of 28%) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the
merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and
certifies that such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or a substitute or successor form); or (2) a Non-
U.S. Holder that (a) provides a certification of such Non-U.S. Holder’s foreign status on the appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a
substitute or successor form) or (b) otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s
U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

General

Each of LifeLock, on the one hand, and Symantec and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, have agreed to use its reasonable best
efforts to comply with all regulatory notification requirements and obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including taking all reasonable actions and doing all things
reasonably necessary to (1) resolve any objections from a governmental authority; and (2) avoid or eliminate any impediment that may
be asserted by a governmental authority. However, Symantec is not obligated to consent or offer to divest or hold separate any business
or assets of Symantec or LifeLock. If, and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of the merger pursuant to the HSR Act and any
other antitrust law applicable to the merger, each of Symantec and Acquisition Sub (and their respective affiliates, if applicable), have
agreed under the merger agreement to (1) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise,
(a) the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets (whether
tangible or intangible), rights, products or business of Symantec and Acquisition Sub (and their respective affiliates, if applicable) on
the one hand, and LifeLock and its subsidiaries, on the other hand, in each case conditioned upon the consummation of the merger and
(b) any other restrictions on the activities of Symantec and Acquisition Sub (and their respective affiliates, if applicable), on the one
hand and Symantec and its subsidiaries, on the other hand; and (2) contest, defend and appeal any legal proceedings, whether judicial
or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger, in each case unless taking such action would
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the benefits to be obtained by virtue of the merger.

HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters

Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the merger cannot be completed until LifeLock and Symantec file a
notification and report form with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, which we refer to as the “DOJ,” as
required by the HSR Act, and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. LifeLock and Symantec made the
necessary filings with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ on December 6, 2016. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act
may not be completed until the expiration of a 30 calendar day waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act
notification forms (which waiting period, in relation to the merger, would expire at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on January 5, 2017) or the
early termination of that waiting period. On December 21, 2016, the FTC granted early termination of the waiting period under the
HSR Act, effective immediately.

At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act, the FTC or the Antitrust Division of the DOJ could take such action under the

Table of Contents

antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking
divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing
relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of
the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the
public interest. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of
the parties. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

Other Regulatory Approvals

One or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the
necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin
or overturn regulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals.
There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether such approvals
will ultimately be obtained, and there may be a substantial period of time between the approval by LifeLock stockholders and the
completion of the merger.

Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these
regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and
approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms of
the merger agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the merger not being satisfied.

Legal Proceedings Regarding the Merger

In connection with the announcement of the merger, two LifeLock stockholders filed purported class actions on behalf of a class
of all LifeLock stockholders. The first class action was filed on December 15, 2016, in Arizona Superior Court, Maricopa County, and
is captioned, Minzer v. LifeLock, Inc. et al, CV-2016-53742. We refer to this as the “Minzer Action.” The second class action was filed
on December 16, 2016, in the United States District Court of Arizona, and is captioned, Parshall v. LifeLock, Inc. et al, Civ. No. 2:16-
cv-04434-DKD. We refer to this as the “Parshall Action.” Both suits name as defendants LifeLock, Symantec and Acquisition Sub, as
well as Hilary Schneider, Roy Guthrie, Todd Davis, Gary Briggs, David Cowan, Albert Pimentel, Thomas Ridge and Jaynie Miller
Studenmund. We refer to these individuals named as defendants as the “Individual Defendants.” The Minzer Action alleges that the
Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to LifeLock stockholders, including the duties of care, loyalty and good faith, by,
among other things, causing LifeLock to agree to a merger transaction with Symantec at an unfair price and pursuant to an unfair
process, and by making disclosures in the preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC concerning the transaction that are materially
misleading. Plaintiff Minzer also claims that Symantec and Acquisition Sub aided and abetted the Individual Defendants’ breaches.
Based on these allegations, the Parshall Action claims that LifeLock and the Individual Defendants violated Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act and Symantec and the Individual Defendants violated Section 20 of the Exchange Act. Both complaints seek to enjoin or
rescind the merger, seek an award of unspecified damages, attorneys’ and experts’ fees and costs, and request that the case be certified
as a class action. LifeLock and the Individual Defendants believe that the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit.

PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

We are asking you to adopt the merger agreement. For a summary of and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the
information about the merger agreement throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth under the section of this
proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement.” A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement.
You are urged to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety.

Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of common
stock. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, and shares not in attendance will have the same effect as voting against the proposal.

The LifeLock Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 2: ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

We are asking you to approve the adjournment of the special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting. If LifeLock
stockholders approve this proposal, we can adjourn the special meeting and any adjourned session of the special meeting and use the
additional time to solicit additional proxies, including soliciting proxies from LifeLock stockholders that have previously returned
properly signed proxies voting against adoption of the merger agreement. Among other things, approval of the adjournment of the
special meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt
the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting could mean that, even if we received proxies representing a sufficient number
of votes against adoption of the merger agreement such that the adoption of the merger agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn
the special meeting without a vote on the adoption of the merger agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change
their votes to votes in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the special meeting if a quorum
is not present, and the chairperson of the special meeting may also adjourn the special meeting for such purpose even if the LifeLock
stockholders have not approved the adjournment of the special meeting.

The vote on this proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. Accordingly, you
may vote to adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve this proposal and vice versa. Approval of this proposal, whether or not
a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by
proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, and shares not in attendance
will have no effect on the approval of this proposal.

The LifeLock Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY, NON-BINDING VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
ARRANGEMENTS

Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, promulgated under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote to
approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the payment of certain compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger.

We are asking LifeLock stockholders to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger. These payments are set forth in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” and “The Merger
—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” as relates to our named executive officers. In general, the
various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made previously have formed part of
LifeLock’s overall compensation program for our named executive officers and previously have been disclosed to LifeLock
stockholders as part of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related sections of our annual proxy statements and subsequent
applicable filings on Forms 8-K and 10-Q. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee
of the LifeLock Board, which is composed solely of non-management directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with
marketplace norms.

Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting:

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of LifeLock, Inc. approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or
may become payable to LifeLock’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger as disclosed pursuant to
Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned “The Merger—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” and “The Merger—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”
as relates to our named executive officers, in LifeLock’s proxy statement for the special meeting.”

LifeLock stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and, as an advisory vote, the
result will not be binding on LifeLock, the LifeLock Board or Symantec. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are
contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory
vote, if the merger is consummated our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or that
otherwise relates to the merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.

The vote on this proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. Accordingly, you
may vote to adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve this proposal and vice versa. Approval of this proposal, whether or not
a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present in person or represented by
proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, and shares not in attendance
will have no effect on the approval of this proposal.

The LifeLock Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following summary describes the material provisions of the merger agreement. The descriptions of the merger agreement in
this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the merger
agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We
encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information
about the merger agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of
the merger agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.

The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the merger agreement (1) were made
only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger
agreement; (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by LifeLock, Symantec
and Acquisition Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement; and (4) may also be subject to a contractual
standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases were
qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Symantec and Acquisition Sub by LifeLock in connection with the merger agreement. In
addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the merger agreement for the purpose of allocating contractual
risk between LifeLock, Symantec and Acquisition Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of
materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Further, the representations and warranties were
negotiated with the principal purpose of establishing the circumstances in which a party to the merger agreement may have the right
not to consummate the merger if the representations and warranties of the other party prove to be untrue due to a change in
circumstance or otherwise. LifeLock stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts
or condition of LifeLock, Symantec or Acquisition Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information
concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the merger agreement and subsequent
developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may have been included in this proxy statement. In addition,
you should not rely on the covenants in the merger agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of LifeLock, Symantec
and Acquisition Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure
letter to the merger agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice
to the public. The merger agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its
terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information regarding LifeLock, Symantec, Acquisition Sub or their
respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the merger agreement should
not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with the SEC regarding
LifeLock and our business. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find Additional Information.”

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

The closing of the merger will take place no later than the second business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions to closing of the merger (described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Conditions to the Closing of the
Merger”), other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of each of such conditions, or such other time mutually agreed to in writing by LifeLock, Symantec and Acquisition Sub.
However, the merger agreement provides that Symantec will not be obligated to consummate the closing prior to January 31, 2017. In
addition, if Symantec has not timely received specified financial information (as such term is defined in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “—Financing Cooperation”) prior to the closing or if such specified financial information is not compliant (as such
term is defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned

“—Financing Cooperation”), Symantec shall not be obligated to consummate the closing until five business days after the date
Symantec has received the specified financial information during which five-day period such specified financial information is and
remains compliant. Concurrently with the closing of the merger, the parties will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware as provided under the DGCL. The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger, or at
such later time agreed to in writing by the parties and specified in such certificate of merger.

Effects of the Merger; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers

The merger agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, and in accordance with the
DGCL, at the effective time of the merger, (1) Acquisition Sub will be merged with and into LifeLock and LifeLock will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Symantec; (2) the separate corporate existence of Acquisition Sub will cease; and (3) LifeLock will
continue as the surviving corporation. From and after the effective time of the merger, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of LifeLock and Acquisition Sub will vest in the surviving corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of LifeLock
and Acquisition Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the surviving corporation.

At the effective time of the merger, the certificate of incorporation of LifeLock as the surviving corporation will be amended and
restated in its entirety to read substantially identically to the certificate of incorporation of Acquisition Sub, except that at the effective
time of the merger, the certificate of incorporation of the surviving corporation will be amended so that the name of the surviving
corporation will be “LifeLock, Inc.”, and the bylaws of Acquisition Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger, will be the bylaws of the surviving corporation, until thereafter amended.

The parties will take all necessary actions to ensure that, at the effective time of the merger, the board of directors of the surviving
corporation will consist of the directors of Acquisition Sub as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation until their successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified. The parties will take all necessary action to ensure that at the effective time of the merger, the officers of
LifeLock as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be the officers of the surviving corporation, until their
respective successors are duly appointed.

Conversion of Shares

Common Stock

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock of LifeLock (other than shares held by (1) LifeLock
as treasury stock; (2) Symantec or Acquisition Sub; (3) any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock, Symantec or
Acquisition Sub; and (4) LifeLock stockholders who have neither voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement nor consented
thereto in writing and have properly and validly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such
shares) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $24.00 per
share, without interest thereon and subject to applicable withholding taxes.

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of common stock held by (1) LifeLock, (2) Symantec or Acquisition
Sub or (3) their respective subsidiaries shall be cancelled and extinguished and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

Table of Contents

Equity Awards; ESPP

The merger agreement provides that LifeLock’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will be subject to the following treatment at the effective time of the merger:

Stock Options

At the effective time of the merger, except with respect to any options to purchase shares of common stock held by non-employee
directors, vested options will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive cash amount(s), without interest and
subject to any required tax withholdings, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the total number of shares of common stock
issuable upon exercise in full of such vested option by (2) the excess, if any, of $24.00, over the applicable per share exercise price of
such cancelled vested option.

At the effective time of the merger, except with respect to options to purchase shares of common stock held by a non-employee
director, each unvested option will be assumed by Symantec and automatically converted into an assumed option. The per share
exercise price for each assumed option will equal the per share exercise price for the unvested option immediately before the effective
time of the merger, divided by the exchange ratio, with the resulting number rounded up to the nearest whole cent. The number of
shares subject to each assumed option will equal the number of shares covered by the unvested option immediately before the effective
time of the merger, multiplied by the exchange ratio, with the resulting number rounded down to the nearest whole share. The assumed
options also remain subject to any applicable provisions under the LifeLock Stock Plan under which the award was granted or any
stock option, employment, change of control, or other plan or agreement between the holder of the assumed option and LifeLock.

Restricted Stock Units

At the effective time of the merger, except with respect to any restricted stock units covering shares of common stock held by
non-employee directors, (a) the portion of each restricted stock unit award covering shares of common stock outstanding and unsettled
immediately before the effective time of the merger, which we refer to as an RSU, that is vested as of the effective time of the merger,
and (b) any portion of an RSU that by its terms accelerates vesting that is held by a terminated service provider, which we refer to as
the vested RSUs, will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive cash amount(s), without interest and subject to
any required tax withholdings, equal to the total number of shares of common stock subject to the vested RSU multiplied by $24.00.

At the effective time of the merger, except with respect to any RSU held by a non-employee director, each unvested RSU will be
assumed by Symantec and automatically converted into an assumed RSU. Each assumed RSU will cover a number of shares of
Symantec common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock subject to the unvested RSU immediately before the effective
time of the merger, multiplied by the exchange ratio, with the resulting number rounded down to the nearest whole share. The assumed
RSUs also remain subject to any applicable provisions under the LifeLock Stock Plan under which the award was granted or any
restricted stock unit, employment, change of control or other plan or agreement between the holder of the assumed RSU and LifeLock.

Restricted Stock Awards

At the effective time of the merger, each share of common stock that remains unvested and outstanding as of immediately before
the effective time of the merger (other than certain shares that are held by LifeLock as treasury stock, owned by Symantec or
Acquisition Sub or owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock, Symantec, or Acquisition Sub and other than
certain shares that are held by holders who have neither voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement nor consented to such
adoption in writing

and who have properly and validly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares), which
we refer to as “RSAs” or “restricted stock,” will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive a cash amount,
without interest and subject to any required tax withholdings, equal to $24.00. Such cash payment will be retained by Symantec and
will become payable only upon the occurrence of the date that such RSAs would have become vested under the vesting schedule in
place for such RSAs immediately before or at the effective time of the merger (subject to the restrictions and other terms of such
vesting schedule and giving effect to any applicable agreement between the holder of such RSAs and Symantec).

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards

At the effective time of the merger, each LifeLock restricted stock award with performance-based vesting, which we refer to as a
“PRSA,” will be treated in accordance with the Notice of Grant of Performance-Based Restricted Stock Award and the Performance-
Based Restricted Stock Agreement governing the PRSA and any employment, change of control, or other plan or agreement between
the holder of the PRSA and LifeLock. Each share of common stock subject to the PRSA that remains unvested and outstanding
immediately before the effective time of the merger will be treated in the same manner as RSAs, as described in the immediately
preceding paragraph above. Additional terms applicable to the PRSAs are described under the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards.”

Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units Held by Non-Employee Directors

At the effective time of the merger, each director option, will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive
cash amount(s), without interest and subject to any required tax withholdings, equal to the total number of shares of common stock
issuable upon exercise in full of such option multiplied by the excess, if any, of $24.00 over the applicable per share exercise price of
such cancelled option.

At the effective time of the merger, each director RSU, will be cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive
cash amount(s), without interest and subject to any required tax withholdings, equal to the total number of shares of common stock
subject to the RSU multiplied by $24.00.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Subject to the consummation of the merger, the ESPP will terminate as of the effective time of the merger. No new purchase
period or offer period will begin under the ESPP after the date of the merger agreement. The merger agreement requires that
participation in the ESPP be limited to those employees who were participants in the ESPP on the date of the merger agreement and
that each individual participating in the purchase period in progress on the date of the merger agreement is not permitted to (1) increase
his or her payroll contribution rate or (2) make separate non-payroll contributions that would have the effect of providing such
increase, in each case, pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in effect immediately before the date of the merger agreement, unless as may
be required by applicable law. Any purchase period under the ESPP that otherwise would be outstanding as of the effective time of the
merger will be terminated no later than one business day before the date on which the effective time of the merger occurs and any
adjustments that may be necessary or advisable to reflect this shortened purchase period will be made, but otherwise this shortened
purchase period will be treated as a fully effective and completed purchase period for all purposes under the ESPP. Any purchase right
that is outstanding under the ESPP will be exercised no later than one business day before the date on which the effective time of the
merger occurs and shares purchased under the ESPP generally will be treated in the same manner as other shares of common stock in
the merger, which generally means that the shares will be converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration in cash,
without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, for each share of common stock held, unless the holder of such share has
neither voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement nor consented thereto in writing and has properly and validly exercised
and perfected their appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares.

Exchange and Payment Procedures

Prior to the closing of the merger, Symantec will select a bank or trust company, which we refer to as the “paying agent,” to make
payments of the merger consideration to LifeLock stockholders. At or prior to the closing of the merger, Symantec will deposit or cause
to be deposited with the paying agent cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of shares of common stock
become entitled pursuant to the merger agreement.

Promptly following the effective time of the merger, the paying agent will send to each holder of record of shares of common
stock a letter of transmittal and instructions advising LifeLock stockholders how to surrender stock certificates and book-entry shares
in exchange for the consideration payable under the merger agreement. Upon receipt of (1) surrendered certificates (or an appropriate
affidavit for lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, together with any required bond) or an “agent’s message” in customary form or the
provision of such other evidence with respect to book-entry shares, if any, that the paying agent may reasonably request, and (2) a
signed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
shares will be entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of
common stock represented by such certificate by (2) the per share price of $24.00 (without interest and less any applicable withholding
taxes payable in respect thereof).

If any cash deposited with the paying agent is not distributed to the holders of shares within one year following the effective time
of the merger, such cash will be returned to Symantec, upon demand, and any LifeLock stockholders who have not complied with the
exchange procedures in the merger agreement will thereafter look only to Symantec, solely as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction
of their claims for payment. None of Symantec, Acquisition Sub, LifeLock, the surviving corporation or the paying agent will be liable
to any LifeLock stockholder with respect to any cash amounts properly delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property law, escheat law or similar law.

The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a LifeLock stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has
been stolen or destroyed. In the event that any certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then before such stockholder will be
entitled to receive the per share merger consideration, Symantec or the paying agent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the payment of the merger consideration, require such stockholder to make an affidavit of the loss, theft or destruction, and to deliver
a bond in such amount as Symantec or the paying agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Symantec,
the surviving corporation or the paying agent with respect to such certificate.

Representations and Warranties

The merger agreement contains representations and warranties of LifeLock, Symantec and Acquisition Sub.

Some of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement made by LifeLock are qualified as to “materiality” or
“Company Material Adverse Effect.” For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, “Company Material Adverse
Effect” means, with respect to LifeLock, any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, effect or circumstance, each of which we refer to as
an “Effect,” that, individually or taken together with all other Effects that have occurred prior to the date of determination of the
occurrence of the Company Material Adverse Effect, (1) has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the business, financial condition or results of operations of LifeLock and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially impair or materially delay the consummation of the merger, except that, none of the following (by
itself or when aggregated) will be deemed to be or constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect or will be taken into account when
determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or may, would or could occur (subject to the limitations set
forth below):

No Solicitation of Alternative Acquisition Offers

agreement and the effective time of the merger LifeLock has agreed to cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations
with, and terminate any data room or other access to diligence of, any person, its affiliates and its representatives relating to an
acquisition transaction (as defined below) and to request any person who executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of an acquisition transaction to promptly return or destroy any non-public information furnished by or on behalf of
LifeLock or its subsidiaries prior to the date of the merger agreement.

Under the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of the merger
agreement and the effective time of the merger, LifeLock and its subsidiaries, and their respective directors and executive officers will
not, and LifeLock will not authorize or direct, as the case may be, its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives to, directly

Table of Contents

Notwithstanding these restrictions, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by LifeLock stockholders and after entering into
an acceptable confidentiality agreement, LifeLock may furnish information to, and enter into negotiations or discussions with, a person
regarding a written acquisition proposal if: (1) LifeLock, its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives have not breached
any of the conditions above with respect to the acquisition proposal or such person; (2) the LifeLock Board or a committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal (as defined below); (3) the LifeLock Board or a committee thereof
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; (4) LifeLock will provide written notice to Symantec promptly (within
one business day) following the LifeLock Board’s determination in clauses (2) and (3) above; and (5) LifeLock will substantially
contemporaneously make available to Symantec any non-public information concerning LifeLock and its subsidiaries that is provided
to such person or such person’s representatives that was not previously made available to Symantec.

If LifeLock, its subsidiaries or its or their representatives receives an acquisition proposal or, to LifeLock’s knowledge, an inquiry
related to making a potential acquisition proposal, any request for non-public information in connection with an acquisition proposal,
or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with LifeLock at any time prior to the earlier to occur of the
termination of the merger agreement and the effective time of the merger, LifeLock must promptly (and in all events by a specified
time on the next business day) advise Symantec of such acquisition proposal, request, inquiry or offer, including the identity of the
person making or submitting the acquisition proposal, request, inquiry or offer, the material terms and conditions thereof, and copies of
any written documentation setting forth such terms. Thereafter, LifeLock must keep Symantec reasonably informed, by providing
notice to Symantec in all events by a specified time on the next business day, of any changes in the status and terms of any such offers
or proposals (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement:
 

 
•  an “acquisition proposal” is any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Symantec or Acquisition Sub) relating

to an acquisition transaction;
 

 •  an “acquisition transaction” is any transaction or series of transactions (other than the merger) involving any:
 

 
•  direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any person or “group” (as defined in the Exchange Act) of persons

of securities representing more than 15% of the total outstanding voting power of LifeLock, including pursuant to a
tender offer or exchange offer;

 

 

•  direct or indirect purchase (including by way of a merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction) or other acquisition by any person or “group” of persons
of assets constituting or accounting for more than 15% of the revenue, net income or consolidated assets of LifeLock
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; or

 

 

•  merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other
transaction involving LifeLock or any of its subsidiaries whose business accounts for more than 15% of the revenue,
net income or consolidated assets of LifeLock and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, where the stockholders of
LifeLock (or such subsidiary) prior to the transaction will not own, directly or indirectly, at least 85% of the surviving
company; and

 

 

•  a “superior proposal” is a written acquisition proposal (substituting 50% for 15% and 85% in the definition of “acquisition
transaction” above) that was not solicited in breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement for an
acquisition transaction on terms that the LifeLock Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) would be more favorable from a financial point of view
than the merger and

taking into account any revisions to the merger agreement made or proposed by Symantec prior to the time of such
determination and the other factors and matters deemed relevant in good faith by the LifeLock Board (or any committee
thereof), including the identity of the person making the proposal, the likelihood of consummation, and the legal, financial
(including financing terms), regulatory, timing and other aspects of the proposal.

The LifeLock Board’s Recommendation; Adverse Recommendation Change

Except as described below, and subject to the provisions described below, the LifeLock Board has made the recommendation that
the holders of shares of common stock vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement. The merger agreement provides that the
LifeLock Board will not effect a company board recommendation change except as described below.

Prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by LifeLock stockholders, the LifeLock Board (or a committee thereof) may not
(with any action described in the following being referred to as a “company board recommendation change”):
 

 
•  withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the

LifeLock Board’s recommendation in a manner adverse to Symantec;
 

 •  adopt, approve, or recommend an acquisition proposal;
 

 
•  fail to publicly reaffirm the LifeLock Board’s recommendation within 10 business days of the occurrence of a material event

or development and after Symantec so requests in writing (or, if the special meeting is scheduled to be held within 10
business days, then within one business day after Symantec so requests in writing);

 

 

•  take or fail to take any formal action or make or fail to make any recommendation in connection with a tender or exchange
offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a “stop, look and listen” communication by the LifeLock Board (or
a committee thereof) to LifeLock’s stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the LifeLock Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain
from taking a position with respect to an acquisition proposal until 5:30 p.m., Eastern time, on the 10th business day after the
commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such acquisition proposal without such action being
considered a violation of the merger agreement);

 

 •  fail to include the LifeLock Board’s recommendation in this proxy statement; or
 

 •  cause or permit LifeLock or any of its subsidiaries to enter into an alternative acquisition agreement.

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by LifeLock stockholders, the
LifeLock Board may, upon compliance with the procedures described below, effect a company board recommendation change if
(1) other than in connection with an acquisition proposal that constitutes a superior proposal, there has been an intervening event (as
defined below); or (2) LifeLock has received a written acquisition proposal that the LifeLock Board (or a committee thereof) has
concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal, in each case, if
the LifeLock Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that a failure to effect a company board recommendation change would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the
LifeLock Board’s fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law.

The LifeLock Board may effect a company board recommendation change, but may not terminate the merger agreement, in
response to an intervening event if and only if:
 

 

•  LifeLock has provided prior written notice to Symantec at least five business days in advance to the effect that the LifeLock
Board (or a committee thereof) has (1) made the determination described above; and (2) resolved to effect a company board
recommendation change pursuant to the merger agreement, which notice must describe the applicable intervening event in
reasonable detail; and

•  prior to effecting such company board recommendation change, LifeLock and its representatives, during such five business
day period, must have (1) negotiated with Symantec and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Symantec desires
to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement so that the LifeLock Board
(or a committee thereof) no longer determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that the failure to make a company board recommendation change in response to such intervening event would be
reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable law; and (2) permitted Symantec and
its representatives to make a presentation to the LifeLock Board regarding the merger agreement and any adjustments with
respect thereto (to the extent that Symantec requests to make such a presentation).

In addition, the LifeLock Board may effect a company board recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement in
response to a written acquisition proposal that the LifeLock Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal if and only if:
 

 
•  the LifeLock Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and

outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
pursuant to applicable law;

 

 
•  LifeLock has complied in all material respects with its obligations pursuant to the merger agreement with respect to such

acquisition proposal;
 

 

•  LifeLock has provided prior written notice to Symantec at least five business days in advance to the effect that the LifeLock
Board (or a committee thereof) has (1) received a written acquisition proposal that has not been withdrawn; (2) concluded in
good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such acquisition proposal constitutes a
superior proposal; and (3) resolved to effect a company board recommendation change or to terminate the merger agreement,
which notice will describe the basis for such company board recommendation change or termination, including the identity
of the person or “group” of persons making such acquisition proposal, the material terms of such acquisition proposal and
copies of all relevant documents relating to such acquisition proposal; and

 

 

•  prior to effecting such company board recommendation change or termination, LifeLock and its representatives, during the
five business day notice period described above, have (1) negotiated with Symantec and its representatives in good faith (to
the extent that Symantec desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the merger
agreement so that such acquisition proposal would cease to constitute a superior proposal; and (2) permitted Symantec and
its representatives to make a presentation to the LifeLock Board regarding the merger agreement and any adjustments with
respect thereto (to the extent Symantec requests to make such a presentation).

In the event of any material revision to any such written acquisition proposal described above, LifeLock has also agreed to deliver
a new notice to Symantec and comply with the above procedures with respect to such new written notice (with the notice period being
three business days) and prior to effecting a company board recommendation change or terminating the merger agreement, at the end of
the relevant notice period, the LifeLock Board must have in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) reaffirmed its determination that such bona fide written acquisition proposal is a superior proposal.

For purposes of this proxy statement and the merger agreement, an “intervening event” means any change, event, violation,
inaccuracy, effect or circumstance that (1) as of the date of the merger agreement was not known to the LifeLock Board, or the material
consequences of which (based on facts known to the members of the LifeLock Board as of the date of the merger agreement) were not
reasonably foreseeable as of the date of the merger agreement; and (2) does not relate to any acquisition proposal.

Merger Consideration Financing

Symantec and Acquisition Sub have each agreed to use reasonable best efforts to, among other things, take or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the debt financing (or any
replacement debt financing permitted pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement) on or prior to the closing of the merger in an
amount sufficient to enable Symantec to pay the Required Amount, including entering into and delivering definitive agreements with
respect to such debt financing on or prior to the closing date of the merger, maintaining in effect the commitments with respect to such
debt financing in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, satisfying on a timely basis all conditions to funding
applicable to Symantec or Acquisition Sub, consummating such debt financing at or prior to the closing of the merger, complying with
its obligations pursuant to the terms of the debt financing, and, if all of the conditions to the obligations of the commitment parties
contained in the commitment letter applicable to any such debt financing have been satisfied (or upon funding, would be satisfied) or
waived, enforcing its rights pursuant to such commitment to the extent that the failure to enforce such commitment would adversely
impact the amount or timing of the debt financing or the availability of the debt financing at the closing of the merger.

Symantec and Acquisition Sub agreed to fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the
commitment letter and any fee letters applicable to the debt financing (or any replacement debt financing permitted pursuant to the
terms of the merger agreement) as and when they become due. The “reasonable best efforts” of Symantec and Acquisition Sub include
an obligation on the part of Symantec and Acquisition Sub, if the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable commitment letters
have been satisfied and one or more of the financing sources fails to provide its respective portion of the debt financing (or any
replacement debt financing permitted pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement) and, as a result, the closing of the merger does not
occur when required pursuant to the merger agreement, to promptly commence an appropriate legal proceeding against any such
breaching financing source pursuant to which each of Symantec and Acquisition Sub will use its reasonable best efforts to compel such
breaching financing source to provide its portion of the debt financing.

Symantec and Acquisition Sub have also agreed not to permit any amendments or modifications or grant any waivers of any
provisions or remedies under any debt financing if such amendment, modification or waiver would (1) reduce (or would reasonably be
expected to have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of such debt financing, unless in the case of a reduction in the amount of
such debt financing, Symantec would retain sufficient funds to make payment of the Required Amount at the closing of the merger and
such reduction would not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the closing of the merger of Symantec’s ability to consummate the
debt financing; (2) impose new or additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to
the receipt of the debt financing or any other terms to the debt financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent the closing of the merger or make the timely funding of the debt financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining
such debt financing, less likely to occur; or (3) adversely impact the ability of Symantec, Acquisition Sub or LifeLock, as applicable, to
enforce its rights against the other parties to the commitment or the definitive agreements with respect thereto.

In the event the debt financing (or any replacement debt financing permitted pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement)
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any market flex provisions) contemplated in the commitment letter,
Symantec shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly arrange and obtain alternative financing from the same or alternative sources,
on terms and conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Symantec and Acquisition Sub than the debt financing in an
amount sufficient, together with other financial resources available to Symantec, to pay the Required Amount.

Financing Cooperation

LifeLock has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to, and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries and its
subsidiaries’ respective representatives to, provide Symantec, Acquisition Sub and their

Table of Contents

respective affiliates with such reasonable cooperation in connection with the debt financing as may be reasonably requested by
Symantec and Acquisition Sub and their respective affiliates by, among other things:
 

 
•  making senior management and advisors of LifeLock and its subsidiaries available to participate in meetings, presentations,

agency presentations, road shows, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions with proposed lenders, underwriters, initial
purchasers or placement agents, and in sessions with rating agencies;

 

 

•  reasonably assisting Symantec and its financing sources in their preparation of pro forma financial information and pro
forma financial statements and materials for presentations, confidential information memoranda, bank information
memoranda, offering memoranda, prospectuses, registration statements, rating agency presentations, lender and investor
presentations and similar documents customary or required in connection with the debt financing;

 

 

•  furnishing Symantec and its affiliates and the commitment parties and their respective representatives with certain requested
information, including audited year-end financial statements, unaudited interim financial statements, and certain other
financial information of a type customarily included in an offering memorandum with respect to private placements of debt
securities under Rule 144A;

 

 
•  requesting that LifeLock’s independent accountants provide reasonable and customary assistance to Symantec in connection

with the debt financing and using reasonable best efforts to take such actions within LifeLock’s ability to enable its
independent accountants to provide such assistance to Symantec;

 

 •  providing customary authorization letters; and
 

 •  providing information reasonably requested by Symantec to obtain corporate and facilities ratings.

LifeLock, its subsidiaries and their respective representatives are not required, among other things, to enter into any definitive
agreement or incur any liability or obligation with respect to the debt financing prior to the closing of the merger. Symantec has agreed
to provide customary indemnification and reimbursement with respect to losses, claims, costs or expenses incurred by LifeLock as a
result of LifeLock’s cooperation in connection with the debt financing. Furthermore, such cooperation is not required by LifeLock or
any of its subsidiaries to the extent such cooperation would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the LifeLock or
any of its subsidiaries or create an unreasonable risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of LifeLock or any of its
subsidiaries. Such cooperation does not require (1) any representative of LifeLock or any of its subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or
opinion or take any other action that could reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such representative; (2) the LifeLock
Board or the board of directors of any subsidiary of LifeLock to approve any financing or contracts related thereto; (3) LifeLock and its
subsidiaries to take any action that would conflict with or violate its organizational documents, any applicable laws or result in, prior to
the closing merger, a violation or breach of, or default under, any agreement to which LifeLock or any of its subsidiaries is a party; (4)
LifeLock and its subsidiaries to provide any information (a) the disclosure of which is prohibited or restricted under applicable law; or
(b) where access to such information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine
or other privilege applicable to such information; or violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third person the right terminate or
accelerate the rights pursuant to, any contract to which LifeLock or any of its subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound; provided, that
LifeLock must inform Symantec as to the general nature of what is being withheld as a result of the foregoing and must use its
reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege or contravene any applicable law or
binding agreement (including, if practicable, by obtaining consent for the disclosure thereof); or (5) LifeLock and its subsidiaries to
change any fiscal period or prepare any financial statements or other information that are not available to it. Nothing requires LifeLock
or any of its subsidiaries, prior to closing of the merger, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the debt financing.

Table of Contents

The obligations of Symantec and Acquisition Sub to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement on the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement are not conditioned upon the availability or
consummation of the debt financing or the receipt of the proceeds therefrom.

In addition to LifeLock’s obligations to use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Symantec in connection with the debt
financing as described above, prior to the consummation of the merger, LifeLock is required to deliver to Symantec audited
consolidated balance sheets and related audited consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and
cash flows of LifeLock for each of the three most recently ended fiscal years of LifeLock that have ended at least 60 days prior to the
closing date of the merger and unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related unaudited consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income and cash flows of LifeLock for each subsequent interim quarterly period of LifeLock that has ended at least 40
days prior to the closing date of the merger (and comparable periods for the prior fiscal year), which financial statements we refer to as
the “specified financial information.” LifeLock is required to use its reasonable best efforts to furnish all specified financial
information required to be furnished as promptly as practicable to Symantec and Acquisition Sub. In addition, in the case of any
specified financial information consisting of audited financial statements, LifeLock’s auditors must not have withdrawn any audit
opinion with respect thereto and LifeLock must not have been informed by its auditors that it is required to restate, and LifeLock will
not have restated, any specified financial information or announced any intention to restate or that such restatement is under
consideration or may be a reasonable possibility. We refer to specified financial information meeting the requirements of the prior
sentence as “compliant.” Failure by LifeLock to deliver the specified financial information on a timely basis or if the specified
financial information is not compliant at any time would allow Symantec to delay the consummation of the merger. For more
information see the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Closing and Effective Time of the Merger.”

Stockholders Meeting

LifeLock has agreed to take all necessary action to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
special meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable and on or around the 25th business day following the mailing of this proxy
statement for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of the merger agreement and seeking the non-binding, advisory approval of the
compensation that will or may become payable by LifeLock to its named executive officers in connection with the merger. LifeLock
shall, and shall only, postpone or adjourn the special meeting in certain circumstances related to soliciting additional proxies or
requirements of applicable law.

Employee Benefits

From and after the effective time of the merger, Symantec has agreed to honor all of the LifeLock benefit plans and compensation
and severance arrangements in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the effective time of the merger, provided
that such benefit plans and compensation and severance arrangements may be amended or terminated in accordance with their terms.
For a period of one year following the effective time of the merger, Symantec has agreed to either (1) maintain for the benefit of
continuing employees LifeLock’s benefit plans (other than the opportunity to participate in equity-based benefits, cash incentive,
bonus, severance and, subject to the merger agreement, individual employment agreements, which existing plans and agreements will
be governed by and can only be amended according to their respective terms) at benefit levels that are substantially equivalent to those
in effect on the date of the merger agreement, and provide compensation and benefits to each continuing employee pursuant to such
benefit plans; (2) provide benefits to each continuing employee that, taken as a whole, are substantially equivalent to those benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Symantec; or (3) provide some combination of LifeLock and Symantec benefit plans such
that each continuing employee receives benefits that, taken as a whole, in any case with respect to clauses (1) through (3), are in the
aggregate substantially equivalent to those benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Symantec. For a period of one year
following the effective time of the merger for any continuing employee employed during that period, Symantec has agreed that not to
reduce the aggregate cash compensation, which includes base salary/base wages and target incentive compensation opportunity,
payable to

the continuing employee. Also, for a period of one year following the effective time of the merger, Symantec has agreed to provide
severance benefits that are substantially equivalent to those benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Symantec and its
affiliates; provided, however, that this provision does not permit Symantec to amend, terminate or rescind, at any time after the
effective time of the merger on a unilateral basis, any severance or retention benefits, including change of control acceleration of equity
granted to an individual in a written agreement signed by the LifeLock and such individual prior to the effective time of the merger,
without such individual’s written consent or as explicitly permitted under the terms of such written agreement.

To the extent that one or more of our or Symantec benefit plans is made available to a continuing employee, Symantec has agreed
that such continuing employee will be granted credit for all service to LifeLock prior to the effective time of the merger for purposes of
eligibility to participate and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance pay entitlement), except that such service need not be credited if it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Symantec has agreed that (1) each continuing employee will be
immediately eligible to participate in any new employee benefit plans intended to replace one of our benefit plans in which a
continuing employee participates as of the effective time of the merger; (2) for any new health or other welfare benefit plans, all
waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability requirements and
actively-at-work or similar requirements will be waived, and eligible expenses incurred by a continuing employee during a replaced
plan’s plan year will be credited to the replacement plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-payments, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such new plan; and (3) the replacement
flexible spending plan accounts of a continuing employee will be credited with any unused balance in any flexible spending plan
account that is replaced. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a continuing employee as of immediately prior to the
effective time of the merger will be credited to such continuing employee following the effective time of the merger and will not be
subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture. Additionally, unless Symantec provides written notice to us no later than 10 business days
before the effective time of the merger, we will terminate our 401(k) Plan effective as of the day immediately preceding the effective
time of the merger.

Efforts to Close the Merger

Under the merger agreement, Symantec, Acquisition Sub and LifeLock agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken all actions, do (or cause to be done) all things, and assist and cooperate with the other parties, in each case as are necessary,
proper or advisable pursuant to applicable law or otherwise to consummate the merger and effect the other contemplated transactions
thereunder, including using their reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to closing the merger described below to be satisfied,
comply with all regulatory filing and notification requirements and obtain all regulatory approvals required to consummate the merger
and effect the other contemplated transactions thereunder and seek to obtain any required consents under LifeLock’s material contracts.

Additionally, under the merger agreement, if and to the extent necessary to obtain regulatory approval of the merger, Symantec,
Acquisition Sub agreed to (1) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, license or other disposition of any and all of the capital stock or other equity or voting interests, assets (whether tangible or
intangible), rights, products or businesses of Symantec, Acquisition Sub, on the one hand, and LifeLock, on the other hand, in each
case conditioned upon the consummation of the merger and any other restrictions on the activities of Symantec and Acquisition Sub
(and their respective affiliates, if applicable) on the one hand and LifeLock and its subsidiaries on the other; and (2) contest, defend and
appeal any legal proceedings challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the merger, in each case unless taking such
action would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the benefits to be obtained by virtue of the merger.

Indemnification and Insurance

The merger agreement provides that the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Symantec and its subsidiaries will
cause the surviving corporation to) honor and fulfill, in all respects to the extent permitted under applicable law the obligations of
LifeLock and its subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements between LifeLock, on the one hand, and any of their
respective current or former directors, officers or employees of LifeLock (and any person who becomes a director, officer or employee
of LifeLock or any of its subsidiaries prior to the effective time), on the other hand.

In addition, the merger agreement provides that, during the six year period commencing at the effective time of the merger, the
surviving corporation will (and Symantec will cause the surviving corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each current or former
director, officer or employee of LifeLock or its subsidiaries, to the fullest extent permitted by law, from and against all costs, fees and
expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement or compromise in connection with any legal proceeding arising, directly or indirectly, out of or pertaining, directly or
indirectly, to (1) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such indemnified person’s capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent of LifeLock or its subsidiaries or other affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or
omission, occurred prior to or, at the effective time of the merger); and (2) the merger, as well as any actions taken by LifeLock,
Symantec or Acquisition Sub with respect thereto (including any disposition of assets of the surviving corporation or any of its
subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the surviving corporation or any of its subsidiaries insolvent). The merger agreement also
provides that the surviving corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred by
any such indemnified person in the defense of such legal proceeding.

In addition, without limiting the foregoing, unless LifeLock has purchased a “tail” policy prior to the effective time of the merger
(which LifeLock may purchase, provided that the premium for such insurance does not exceed 300% of the aggregate annual premiums
currently paid), the merger agreement requires Symantec to cause the surviving corporation to maintain, on terms no less advantageous
to the indemnified parties, LifeLock’s directors’ and officers’ insurance policies for a period of at least six years commencing at the
effective time of the merger. Neither Symantec nor the surviving corporation will be required to pay premiums for such policy to the
extent such premiums exceed, on an annual basis, 300% of the aggregate annual premiums currently paid by LifeLock, and if the
premium for such insurance coverage would exceed such amount Symantec shall be obligated to cause the surviving corporation to
obtain the greatest coverage available for a cost equal to such amount.

The merger agreement also provides that the indemnified parties are third party beneficiaries of the indemnification and insurance
provisions in the merger agreement and are entitled to enforce such provisions.

For more information, refer to the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Transaction Litigation

LifeLock will (1) provide Symantec with prompt notice of all stockholder litigation relating to the merger agreement; (2) keep
Symantec reasonably informed with respect to status thereof; (3) give Symantec the opportunity to participate in the defense,
settlement or prosecution of any such litigation; and (4) will consult with Symantec with respect to the defense, settlement or
prosecution of any such litigation and will consider in good faith Symantec’s advice with respect to such litigation. LifeLock may not
compromise, settle or come to an arrangement, or agree to do any of the foregoing, regarding any such litigation without Symantec’s
prior written consent.

extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and
warranty will be true and correct as of such earlier date), except for any such failure to be true and correct that, individually
or in the aggregate, as have not had and would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or materially delay
the consummation of the merger or the ability of Symantec and Acquisition Sub to perform their respective covenants and
obligations pursuant to the merger agreement;

 

 
•  Symantec and Acquisition Sub having performed and complied in all material respects with all covenants and obligations of

the merger agreement required to be performed and complied with by Symantec or Acquisition Sub at or prior to the
effective time of the merger; and

 

 •  the receipt by LifeLock of a customary closing certificate of Symantec and Acquisition Sub.

Even if all the closing conditions are satisfied or waived (where permitted by applicable law), the merger agreement provides that
Symantec will not be obligated to consummate the merger prior to January 31, 2017. For more information, see the section of this
proxy statement with the caption “—Closing and Effective Time of the Merger.” In addition, if Symantec has not timely received
specified financial information prior to the closing or if such specified financial information is not compliant, Symantec shall not be
obligated to consummate the closing until five business days after the date Symantec has received the specified financial information
during which five-day period such specified financial information is and remains compliant. For more information, see the section of
this proxy statement with the caption “—Financing Cooperation.”

Termination of the Merger Agreement

The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before or after the
adoption of the merger agreement by LifeLock stockholders, in the following ways:
 

 •  by mutual written agreement of LifeLock and Symantec;
 

 •  by either LifeLock or Symantec if:
 

 

•  (1) any permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal
or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the merger will be in effect, or any action has
been taken by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction, that, in each case, prohibits, makes illegal or
enjoins the consummation of the merger and has become final and non-appealable or (2) any statute, law (including
common law), ordinance, rule, regulation or stock exchange listing requirement is enacted, entered, enforced or
deemed applicable to the merger that prohibits, makes illegal or enjoins the consummation of the merger;

 

 

•  the merger has not been consummated by 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on April 30, 2017, which we refer to as the
“termination date,” except that (1) if as of the termination date, all conditions to the merger agreement are satisfied
(other than those conditions to be satisfied at the time of the closing of the merger) or waived (where permissible
pursuant to applicable law), other than the closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement relating to the
expiration or termination of the U.S. antitrust waiting period or relating to no injunctions, laws, or other judgments or
orders or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the merger or making it illegal, then either
LifeLock or Symantec may elect by written notice to the other party to extend the termination date until 11:59 p.m.,
Pacific time, on August 21, 2017 or (2) if as of the termination date, Symantec has not received specified financial
information (as such term is defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Financing Cooperation”) or
such specified financial information is not compliant (as such term is defined in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “—Financing Cooperation”), and Symantec is therefore not obligated to consummate the closing until five
business days after the date that Symantec has received such specified

termination date until 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on the date that is five business days after the completion of the five
business day period set forth above, but in no event later than 11:59 p.m., Pacific time, on August 21, 2017 (and such
date and time shall thereafter constitute the termination date). In each case, the right to terminate the merger
agreement pursuant to this provision will not be available to any party whose action or failure to act (which action or
failure to act constitutes a breach by such party of the merger agreement) has been the primary cause of, or primarily
resulted in, either (A) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the obligations of the terminating party to consummate
the merger prior to the termination date, or (B) the failure to consummate the merger prior to the termination date;

 

 

•  the special meeting has been held and the LifeLock stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement (except that the
right to terminate the merger agreement pursuant to this provision will not be available to any party whose action or
failure to act (which action or failure to act constitutes a breach by such party of the merger agreement) has been the
primary cause of, or primarily resulted in, the failure to obtain the approval of the LifeLock stockholders at the special
meeting);

 

 •  by LifeLock if:
 

 

•  Symantec or Acquisition Sub has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its respective
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements in the merger agreement, such that the related closing
condition would not be satisfied, except that if such breach is capable of being cured by the termination date,
LifeLock will not be entitled to terminate the merger agreement prior to the delivery by LifeLock to Symantec of
written notice of such breach, delivered at least 30 days prior to such termination, it being understood that LifeLock
will not be entitled to terminate the merger agreement if such breach has been cured prior to termination;

 

 

•  prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by LifeLock stockholders if (1) LifeLock has received a superior
proposal; (2) the LifeLock Board (or a committee thereof) has authorized LifeLock to enter into an alternative
acquisition agreement to consummate the acquisition transaction contemplated by such superior proposal; (3) prior to
or concurrently with such termination, LifeLock has paid to Symantec an $87.5 million termination fee; and (4)
LifeLock has complied in all material respects with its non-solicitation, change in board recommendation and related
obligations under the merger agreement with respect to such superior proposal;

 

 •  by Symantec, if:
 

 

•  LifeLock has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements in the merger agreement, such that the related closing condition would not be satisfied, except that if
such breach is capable of being cured by the termination date, Symantec will not be entitled to terminate the merger
agreement prior to the delivery by Symantec to LifeLock of written notice of such breach, delivered at least 30 days
prior to such termination, it being understood that Symantec will not be entitled to terminate the merger agreement if
such breach has been cured prior to termination; or

 

 •  the LifeLock Board has effected a company board recommendation change.

In the event that the merger agreement is validly terminated pursuant to the termination rights set forth in the merger agreement,
such termination will be effective immediately upon the mutual agreement of LifeLock and Symantec or the delivery of written notice
by the terminating party to the other parties. Following termination of the merger agreement pursuant to the termination rights above,
the merger agreement will be of no further force or effect without liability of any party to the other parties, as applicable, except that
certain sections of the merger agreement will survive the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with their respective
terms, including, among other things, terms relating to termination fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the merger
agreement will relieve (1) any party from any liability for any intentional breach of the merger

agreement and (2) LifeLock or (subject to sections of the merger agreement relating to manner and notice of termination and effect of
termination; fees and expenses; and remedies) Symantec or Acquisition Sub from any liability for its fraud prior to the valid
termination of the merger agreement (in the case of each of (1) and (2), which the parties acknowledge and agree (A) will not be
limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs; and (B) in the case of any damages sought by the non-breaching party,
such damages will include the benefit of the bargain lost by the non-breaching party, taking into consideration relevant matters,
including opportunity costs and the time value of money). In addition, no valid termination of the merger agreement will affect the
rights or obligations of any party pursuant to the confidentiality agreement between Symantec or LifeLock or the financing letters,
which rights, obligations and agreements will survive the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with their respective
terms.

Termination Fees

If the merger agreement is terminated in specified circumstances, LifeLock has agreed to pay Symantec a termination fee of $87.5
million.

Symantec will be entitled to receive the termination fee from LifeLock if the merger agreement is validly terminated:
 

 

•  (1) (a) by Symantec, because LifeLock has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the merger agreement, which breach or failure to perform would result in a
failure of a related closing condition set forth in the merger agreement(b) by either Symantec or LifeLock because the
LifeLock stockholders fail to adopt the merger agreement at the special meeting at which a vote is taken on the adoption of
the merger agreement or (c) by either Symantec or LifeLock because the merger has not been consummated by the
termination date pursuant to the termination section of the merger agreement; (2) the conditions to closing relating to
antitrust or the conditions related to prohibitive laws or orders set forth in the merger agreement have been satisfied or are
capable of being satisfied and the conditions to closing relating to the accuracy of Symantec’s representations and warranties
and performance of Symantec’s covenants would be satisfied if the date of such termination was the closing date of the
merger; (3) prior to termination under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, an acquisition proposal made
or renewed following the date of the merger agreement has been publicly announced or publicly disclosed and not publicly
withdrawn or otherwise abandoned by LifeLock; and (4) within one year of the termination of the merger agreement, either
an acquisition transaction is consummated or LifeLock enters into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation of
an acquisition transaction and such acquisition transaction is subsequently consummated (whether such consummation
occurs before or after the one-year anniversary of such termination) (provided that, for purposes of the termination fee, all
references to “15%” and “85%” in the definition of “acquisition transaction” are deemed to be references to “50%”);

 

 •  by Symantec, because the LifeLock Board has effected a company board recommendation change; or
 

 
•  by LifeLock (at any time prior to adoption of the merger agreement by LifeLock stockholders), to enter into an alternative

acquisition agreement with respect to a superior proposal authorized by the LifeLock Board (or a committee thereof).

Specific Performance

Symantec, Acquisition Sub and LifeLock are entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches (or threatened breaches) of the merger agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of the merger
agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Fees and Expenses

Except as specified in the merger agreement, whether or not the merger is completed, LifeLock, on the one hand, and Symantec
and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, are each responsible for all of their respective fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Symantec or the surviving corporation is responsible for
all fees and expenses of the payment agent. Except as specified in the merger agreement, Symantec will pay or cause to be paid all
(i) transfer, stamp and documentary taxes or fees; and (ii) sales, use, gains, real property transfer and other similar taxes or fees, in each
case arising out of or in connection with the consummation of the merger.

Third-Party Beneficiaries

The merger agreement provides that, other than the provisions discussed in the sections of this proxy statement entitled “—
Indemnification and Insurance,” which will be for the benefit of the parties described therein, “—Conversion of Shares,” which will be
for the benefit of the holders of common stock, RSUs, options, RSAs and PRSAs from and after the effective time and the merger
(provided that, to the extent Symantec or Acquisition Sub wrongfully terminates or willfully breaches the merger agreement, then
following the termination of the merger agreement, LifeLock would be entitled to seek damages and other relief (including equitable
relief) on behalf of such holders), each party’s respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the merger agreement
are solely for the benefit of the other parties to the merger agreement in accordance with and subject to the terms of the merger
agreement. The merger agreement is not intended to, and will not, confer any rights or remedies upon any other person, subject to
certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement. In addition, certain provisions discussed in the sections of this proxy
statement entitled “—Amendment,” and “—Governing Law; Venue”, among others, that expressly relate to the financing sources of
Symantec will inure to the benefit of the financing sources and their affiliates and representatives, which we refer to as the “financing
source related parties,” each of whom are intended to be third-party beneficiaries of such provisions.

Amendment

Subject to applicable law and the other provisions of the merger agreement, the merger agreement may be amended in writing by
the parties at any time prior to closing of the merger, whether before or after adoption of the merger agreement by LifeLock
stockholders. However, after adoption of the merger agreement by LifeLock stockholders, no amendment that requires further approval
by such LifeLock stockholders pursuant to the DGCL may be made without such approval. The provisions expressly relating to the
financing sources may not be amended, modified or altered in a manner that adversely impacts any financing source related party
without the prior written consent of such adversely impacted party.

Governing Law; Venue

The merger agreement is governed by Delaware law. The exclusive venue for disputes is the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware or, to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware does not have subject matter jurisdiction, any state or federal court in the State of Delaware, except that any legal
proceeding involving the financing sources arising out of, or relating to, the merger, the financing, the financing letters, or the
performance of services thereunder or related will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the
State of New York in the borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof.

THE SUPPORT AGREEMENT

The following summary describes the material provisions of the support agreement. The description of the support agreement in
this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the support
agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We
encourage you to read the support agreement carefully and in its entirety.

As a condition and inducement to Symantec entering into the merger agreement, the supporting stockholders entered into the
support agreement. At the close of business on December 21, 2016, the record date of the special meeting, the supporting stockholders
collectively owned or controlled 7,269,391 shares of common stock, which represented 7.7% of all outstanding shares of common
stock on the record date. In connection with the execution and delivery of the support agreement, Symantec did not pay these
stockholders any consideration separate from the consideration they will receive pursuant to the merger agreement in respect of their
shares or as described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of LifeLock’s Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger.”

Voting Provisions

Pursuant to the support agreement, the supporting stockholders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the
support agreement, to vote all of their shares of common stock or other voting securities of LifeLock that they acquire beneficial
ownership of after the date of the support agreement, including, without limitation, by purchase, at any time prior to the termination of
the support agreement, in the following manner:
 

 
•  in favor of (1) the adoption of the merger agreement, and (2) the adjournment or postponement of the meeting to a later date,

if there are not sufficient votes for the adoption of the merger agreement;
 

 
•  in favor of any other matter considered at the special meeting that the LifeLock Board has (1) determined is necessary or

desirable for the consummation of the merger; (2) disclosed in this proxy statement or other written materials distributed to
all LifeLock stockholders; and (3) recommended that the LifeLock stockholders adopt; and

 

 •  against any alternative acquisition proposal.

Nothing in the support agreement limits the rights of any member of the LifeLock Board to vote in favor of, against or abstain
with respect to, any matters presented to the LifeLock stockholders. The support agreement does not limit or restrict a supporting
stockholder in his or her capacity as a director or officer from acting in such capacity in such person’s discretion on any matter.

Pursuant to the support agreement, the supporting stockholders have agreed to waive appraisal rights and have provided an
irrevocable proxy to Symantec.

Restrictions on Transfer; Other Actions

Under the support agreement, the supporting stockholders have agreed that until the termination of the support agreement, they
will not:
 

 
•  transfer any shares of LifeLock capital stock beneficially owned by such supporting stockholder unless pursuant to certain

permitted transfers;
 

 
•  grant any proxies or powers of attorney with respect to any of shares of LifeLock capital stock beneficially owned by such

supporting stockholder, deposit any such shares into a voting trust or enter into a support agreement with respect to such
shares; or

expected to impair the ability of such supporting stockholder to perform its obligations under the support agreement in any
material respect or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the merger or the support agreement.

effective time of the merger.

FINANCING OF THE MERGER

The merger agreement is not subject to any financing contingency. Symantec intends to finance the cash portion of the merger
consideration with debt and cash on hand. With respect to the debt financing, Symantec has obtained the Commitment from the
commitment parties pursuant to the commitment letter to provide a senior unsecured bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal
amount of up to $750,000,000, which we refer to as the “bridge facility.” Symantec intends to utilize the bridge facility in the event it
does not issue and sell the full amount of the Senior Notes referenced below at or prior to the closing of the merger.

On or prior to the closing date of the merger, Symantec intends to issue senior notes in a registered public offering, Rule 144A
offering or private placement, which we refer to as the “Senior Notes.” The Commitment will be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by
the aggregate gross cash proceeds actually funded into escrow or received by Symantec or any of its domestic subsidiaries from any
issuance of the Senior Notes on or prior to the closing date of the merger.

The Commitment and other obligations set forth in the commitment letter automatically terminate upon the earliest to occur of (1)
termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms prior to the closing of the merger; (2) the occurrence of the closing of
the merger without the funding of the bridge facility; and (3) 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the date that is five business days after the
termination date (as such term is defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the
Merger Agreement” and as may be extended in accordance with the merger agreement).

The obligation of the commitment parties to provide the debt financing is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions,
including (among other conditions) no Company Material Adverse Effect (as such term is defined in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement—Representations and Warranties”) having occurred with respect to LifeLock, the delivery of
certain LifeLock financial information, including the specified financial information (but subject to different time periods set forth in
the commitment letter), the negotiation, execution and delivery of definitive loan documentation for the bridge facility, and other
customary closing conditions.

MARKET PRICES AND DIVIDEND DATA

Our common stock is listed on NYSE under the symbol “LOCK.” As of December 21, 2016, the record date of the special
meeting, there were 94,947,772 shares of common stock outstanding, held by 36 stockholders of record. Because many shares of
common stock are held by banks, brokers and other nominees on behalf of the beneficial owners of these shares, we are unable to
estimate the total number of LifeLock stockholders represented by these stockholders of record.

The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the high and low sale prices for our common stock as reported by NYSE:
 
   2016    2015    2014  
   High    Low    High    Low    High    Low  
Fiscal First Quarter   $14.20    $ 9.14    $18.81    $13.06    $22.85    $15.50  
Fiscal Second Quarter   $16.00    $11.01    $17.43    $13.86    $17.73    $10.48  
Fiscal Third Quarter   $17.35    $15.40    $16.85    $ 7.18    $15.93    $12.30  
Fiscal Fourth Quarter (through December 22, 2016)   $23.99    $15.96    $15.55    $ 8.55    $19.15    $13.64  

We have never declared or paid, and do not anticipate declaring or paying, any cash dividends on our capital stock.

On December 22, 2016, the latest practicable trading day before the printing of this proxy statement, the closing price for the
common stock on NYSE was $23.86 per share. You are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for our common stock.

Following the merger, there will be no further market for our common stock and it will be delisted from NYSE and deregistered
under the Exchange Act. As a result, following the merger we may no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock, as of
November 15, 2016, of each person or entity who we know to beneficially own 5% or more of the outstanding shares of common
stock, each of our named executive officers and directors, and all of our current directors and executive officers as a group.

Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. In computing the number of shares beneficially
owned by a person, and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock subject to stock options held by that person
that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of November 15, 2016, or issuable pursuant to restricted stock units that are
subject to vesting conditions expected to occur within 60 days of November 15, 2016, are deemed outstanding and beneficially owned
by the person holding the stock option or restricted stock units. Such shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of
computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

Unless otherwise indicated below, the address of each beneficial owner listed in the table is c/o LifeLock, Inc., 60 East Rio Salado
Parkway, Suite 400, Tempe, Arizona 85281. The percentages in the table below are based on 94,351,210 shares of common stock
outstanding as of November 15, 2016. Except as indicated in the footnotes to this table and pursuant to applicable community property
laws, to our knowledge, each stockholder named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares set forth
opposite such stockholder’s name. The information provided in this table is based on our records and information filed with the SEC,
unless otherwise noted.

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Owned Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) will be cancelled and extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $24.00, without interest thereon (the “Per Share Price”), in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.9 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if
required) in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11).

(b) Adjustment to the Per Share Price. The Per Share Price will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with respect to the
Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Company Unvested Shares. The payment of cash pursuant to Section 2.8(g) in exchange for Company Unvested Shares
shall be subject to the same restrictions and vesting arrangements that were applicable to such Company Unvested Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Accordingly, cash otherwise payable or issuable pursuant to Section 2.8(g) in exchange for the Company
Unvested Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Unvested Consideration”) shall be retained by
Parent and shall not be payable by Parent at the Effective Time, and shall instead become payable by Parent on, and only upon the
occurrence of the date that such Company Unvested Shares would have become vested under the vesting schedule in place for such
Company Unvested Shares immediately prior to or at the Effective Time (subject to the restrictions and other terms of such vesting
schedule and giving effect to any agreement between the applicable Continuing Employee and Parent). Parent will make all such
required payments to holders of Unvested Consideration no later than the last day of the calendar month in which such Unvested
Consideration would have become vested under the original vesting schedule and in its discretion may make such payments through a
paying agent authorized by Parent to administer such payments on Parent’s behalf. All amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.8(g)
shall be subject to any required payroll and income tax withholding and shall be paid without interest. No Unvested Consideration, or
right thereto, may be pledged, encumbered, sold, assigned or transferred (including any transfer by operation of law), by any Person,
other than Parent, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in satisfaction of any liability of such Person, prior to the
distribution to such Person of such Unvested Consideration in accordance with this Agreement.

(d) Statutory Rights of Appraisal.

(i) Dissenting Company Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all shares of
Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company
Stockholders who have (A) neither voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and (B) properly
and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL (the “Dissenting Company Shares”) will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share
Price pursuant to this Section 2.7. Such Company Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such
Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company
Shares held by Company Stockholders who have failed to perfect or who have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of
such Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will be deemed to have been converted into, and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price, upon surrender of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares that formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.9.

(ii) Notification of Parent of Demands for Appraisal. The Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL
and received by the Company in respect of Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The
Company may not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for
payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

Section 2.8. Equity Awards.

(a) Company Vested Stock Options. Parent will not assume any Company Vested Stock Options. As of the Effective Time,
each Company Vested Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash amount(s), without interest,
equal to the product obtained by multiplying: (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full
of such Company Vested Stock Option by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the exercise or purchase price per share, if
any attributable to such Company Vested Stock Option (the “Vested Option Consideration”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to any Company Vested Stock Options for which the exercise price per share attributable to such Company Vested Stock
Options is equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, such Company Vested Stock Options will be cancelled without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof and Parent will not assume any such Company Vested Stock Option. The payment of the Vested
Option Consideration will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes.

(b) Company Unvested Stock Options. Except as set forth in Section 2.8(f) below, as of the Effective Time, each Company
Unvested Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into and become an option to acquire Parent Common
Stock, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Company Unvested Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except as follows:

(i) (x) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each Company Unvested Stock Option assumed by
Parent shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company
Unvested Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (y) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of each

Company Unvested Stock Option assumed by Parent shall be determined by dividing the applicable per share exercise price of such
Company Unvested Stock Option, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the
resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent.

(ii) Any restriction on the exercise of any Company Unvested Stock Option assumed and converted by Parent shall
continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company Unvested Stock
Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption of such Company Unvested Stock Option, in each case except
to the extent otherwise provided in any Company Stock Plan, or any stock option, employment, change of control or other plan or
agreement between the holder of a Company Unvested Stock Option and the Company.

(c) Company Vested RSUs. Parent will not assume any Company Vested RSUs. As of the Effective Time, each Company
Vested RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder thereof be cancelled and converted into the right to receive cash amount(s), without interest, equal to the
product obtained by multiplying: (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company RSU award by (ii)
the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the exercise or purchase price per share, if any, attributable to such Company Stock-
Based Award (the “Company Vested RSU Consideration”). The payment of the Company Vested RSU Consideration will be subject to
withholding for all required Taxes.

(d) Company Unvested RSUs. Except as set forth in Section 2.8(f) below, as of the Effective Time, each Company Unvested
RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
the holder thereof be assumed by Parent and shall be converted into a right to receive, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under the Company Unvested RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company Unvested RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting number down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock. Any restriction on the settlement of any Company Unvested RSU assumed by Parent shall continue in full
force and effect and the term, settlement terms, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company Unvested RSU shall otherwise
remain unchanged as a result of the assumption and conversion of such Company Unvested RSU, in each case except to the extent
otherwise provided in any Company Stock Plan, or any restricted stock unit, employment, change of control or other plan or agreement
between the holder of a Company Unvested RSU and the Company.

(e) Company Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards. Each Company Restricted Stock Award with performance-based
vesting (a “Company PRSA”) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated (x) in the same manner as Company
Unvested Shares with respect to each share of Company Common Stock subject to the Company PRSA and (y) in accordance with the
Notice of Grant of Performance-Based Restricted Stock Award and the Performance-Based Restricted Stock Agreement governing
such award and any employment, change of control or other plan or agreement between the holder of the Company PRSA and the
Company.

(f) Company Stock Options and Company RSUs Held By Non-Employee Directors. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 2.8 or otherwise in this Agreement, Parent will not assume any Company Stock Options or Company RSUs
that are held by any individual who is a non-employee director of the Company as of the Closing Date.

(i) As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is held by a non-
employee director as of the Closing Date (a “Director Option”), and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will,
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive cash amount(s), without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying: (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable upon exercise in full

of such Director Option by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the exercise or purchase price per share, if any,
attributable to such Director Option. For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any Director Options for which the exercise price per
share attributable to such Director Options is equal to or greater than the Per Share Price, such Director Options will be cancelled
without any cash payment being made in respect thereof and Parent will not assume any such Director Options. The payment with
respect to such Director Options will be subject to withholding for all required Taxes.

(ii) As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU, whether vested or unvested, that is held by a non-employee
director of the Company as of the Closing Date (a “Director RSU”) and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder thereof be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive cash amount(s), without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying: (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Director RSU award by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Price over the exercise or purchase price
per share, if any, attributable to such Director RSU. The payment with respect to such Director RSUs will be subject to withholding for
all required Taxes.

(g) Payment Procedures. On the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter (at the date of the Surviving Corporation’s
first regularly scheduled payroll after the Effective Time, if practicable, and in no event later than the date of the Surviving
Corporation’s second regularly scheduled payroll after the Effective Time), Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
applicable former holders of Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options to receive a payment from the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, through its payroll system or payroll provider, of all amounts required to be paid to such former holders in
respect of Company Stock-Based Awards or Company Options that are cancelled and converted pursuant to Section 2.8(a) or
Section 2.8(c), as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any payment owed to a holder of Company Stock-Based Awards or
Company Options pursuant to Section 2.8(a) or Section 2.8(c), as applicable, cannot be made through the Company’s or the Surviving
Corporation’s payroll system or payroll provider, then the Surviving Corporation will issue a check for such payment to such holder,
which check will be sent by overnight courier to such holder promptly following the Closing Date (but in no event more than ten
Business Days thereafter).

(h) Further Actions. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the Compensation Committee
of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions
of Section 2.8(a) through Section 2.8(e). The Company shall take all actions which are necessary to ensure that from and after the
Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Company Capital Stock to any Person pursuant
to or in settlement of any Company Options or Company Stock-Based Awards.

(i) Parent Actions Related to Assumed Awards. Parent will take such actions as are reasonably necessary, if any, to reserve
for issuance a number of authorized but unissued shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise or settlement of the
assumed Company Unvested Stock Options and assumed Company Unvested RSUs. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event later than 10 Business Days after the Effective Time), to the extent the assumed Company Unvested Stock Options and
assumed Company Unvested RSUs are not already registered by Parent under the Securities Act, Parent will cause to be filed with the
SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under
the Securities Act, with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the assumed Company Unvested Stock Options and
assumed Company Unvested RSUs. Parent will use the same level of efforts that it uses to maintain the effectiveness of its other
registration statements on Form S-8 to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement(s) for so long as any assumed
Company Unvested Stock Options or assumed Company Unvested RSUs remain outstanding.

(j) Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) will adopt resolutions or take other actions as may be required to provide that

participation in the ESPP shall be limited to those employees who were participants on the date hereof and each individual
participating in the Purchase Period (as defined in the ESPP) in progress on the date of this Agreement will not be permitted to
(i) increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the ESPP from the rate in effect immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement; or (ii) make separate non-payroll contributions to the ESPP that has the effect of increasing his or her contribution rate in
effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, except, in each case, as may be required by applicable Law. Prior to the date of
this Agreement, the Company will take all action that may be necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the Merger, (A) cause
any Purchase Period that would otherwise be outstanding at the Effective Time to be terminated no later than one Business Day prior to
the date on which the Effective Time occurs; (B) make any adjustments that are necessary or advisable to reflect the shortened
Purchase Period, but otherwise treat such shortened Purchase Period as a fully effective and completed Purchase Period for all purposes
pursuant to the ESPP; (C) cause the exercise (as of no later than one Business Day prior to the date on which the Effective Time
occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP; and (D) provide that no further Purchase Period or offer period will
commence pursuant to the ESPP after the date of this Agreement. On such exercise date, the Company will apply the funds credited as
of such date pursuant to the ESPP within each participant’s payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP. Immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time (but subject to
the consummation of the Merger), the Company will terminate the ESPP.

Section 2.9. Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.

(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the “Payment Agent”); and (ii) enter into a payment agent agreement, in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Payment Agent.

(b) Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, for payment to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7,
an amount of cash equal to the aggregate consideration to which such holders of shares of Company Common Stock become entitled
pursuant to Section 2.7. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by
the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States or
any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity of no more than 30
days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s
Corporation, respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks
with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000 (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available)
(such cash and any proceeds thereon, the “Exchange Fund”). To the extent that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments
of the Exchange Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly
pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7; or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable for Parent (or the
Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7 for any reason, then Parent will, or
will cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient for the Payment Agent to make the
payments contemplated by Section 2.7. Any interest or other income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.

(c) Exchange and Payment Procedures.

(i) Certificates. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment
Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common

Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the “Certificates”) whose shares of Company Common
Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7, (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon surrender to the Payment Agent of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in Section 2.11) for cancellation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Payment Agent in
accordance with the terms of such materials and instructions, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange for
the number of shares represented by such Certificate (and Parent will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor
as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate by (2) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in
respect thereof). The Certificate so surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept Certificates upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of the Certificates on the amount payable
upon the surrender of such Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(i). Until so surrendered, the Certificates will be deemed from and
after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7.

(ii) Uncertificated Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock held in book-entry form (the “Uncertificated Shares”) will not be required to deliver a Certificate or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. In
lieu thereof, each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of an Uncertificated Share that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented an outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company Shares and Owned
Company Shares) whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7 will, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” in customary form (it being understood that the
holders of Uncertificated Shares will be deemed to have surrendered such Uncertificated Shares upon receipt of an “agent’s message”
or such other evidence, if any, as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) at the Effective Time, be entitled to receive (and Parent
will cause the Payment Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable) an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated
Shares by (B) the Per Share Price (less any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof). The Uncertificated Shares so
surrendered will be cancelled. The Payment Agent will accept transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of any holder of the Uncertificated Shares on the amount payable upon the
surrender of such Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this Section 2.9(c)(ii). Until so surrendered, Uncertificated Shares will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.7(a). Any Per Share Price paid upon surrender of an Uncertificated Share will be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Uncertificated Share.

(d) DTC Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will cooperate to establish procedures with the
Payment Agent and DTC with the objective that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date,
then the Payment Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned
Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time by
(B) the Per Share Price (such amount, the “DTC Payment”); and (ii) if the Closing occurs after

Table of Contents

11:30 a.m., Eastern time, on the Closing Date, then the Payment Agent will transmit the DTC Payment to DTC or its nominees on the
first Business Day after the Closing Date.

(e) Transfers of Ownership. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock
transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the consideration payable is to be paid in a name other than that in which the Certificates
surrendered or transferred in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, then the
consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.7 may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered or transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate is properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer
Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Payment of the consideration payable with respect to Uncertificated Shares will
only be made to the Person in whose name such Uncertificated Shares are registered.

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares have not been surrendered immediately prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, then any such cash in respect of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of
the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand,
and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore surrendered or transferred their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company Common Stock
for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.9 will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws), solely as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be entitled
pursuant to Section 2.7.

Section 2.10. No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, (a) all shares of
Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be cancelled and cease to exist; and (b) each holder of a
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares previously representing any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration payable therefor in accordance with Section 2.7 (or in the case of
Dissenting Company Shares, the rights pursuant to Section 2.7(d)). The consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades
effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to compliance with the exchange procedures of Section 2.9(c)) be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

Section 2.11. Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Payment Agent will issue in exchange therefor, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by

the holder thereof, the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.7. Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share Price, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 2.12. Required Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, or any
Subsidiary of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based
Awards or Company Options such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Tax Laws. To the
extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

Section 2.13. Necessary Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets,
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company and
Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all such lawful and necessary action.

required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC; and (ii) such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company’s management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and such assessment concluded

internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal
year ending December 31, 2016, and conclude, after such assessment, that such system was effective. Since January 1, 2013, the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. Neither the Company nor its principal executive officer or principal financial officer has received notice from any Governmental

return or destroy, in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement, all non-public information furnished to such Person
by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the date of this Agreement. Subject to the terms of Section 5.3(b) and

Company will not authorize or direct any of its or its Subsidiaries’ employees, consultants or other Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or
assist, any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) furnish to any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective designees) any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or afford to any Person access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective designees), in any such case in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal or with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of, or to knowingly
encourage, facilitate or assist, an Acquisition Proposal or the making of any proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) participate, or engage in discussions or negotiations, with any Person with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal or with respect to any inquiries from third Persons relating to the making of an Acquisition Proposal (other than only
informing such Persons of the provisions contained in this Section 5.3); (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any proposal that
constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (any such letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition Transaction, an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”); or (vi) authorize or
commit to do any of the foregoing. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the (1) termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII and (2) Effective Time, the Company will not be required to enforce, and following prior notice to Parent
including the identity of the Person requesting such waiver, will be permitted to waive, any provision of any standstill or confidentiality
agreement to the extent that such provision prohibits or purports to prohibit a confidential proposal being made to the Company Board
(or any committee thereof).

(b) Superior Proposals. Notwithstanding anything to contrary in this Section 5.3, from the date of this Agreement until the
Company’s receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company and the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may,
directly or indirectly through one or more of their Representatives (including the Company Financial Advisor), following the execution
of an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, (i) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with; (ii) furnish any non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to; or (iii) afford access to the business, properties, assets, books, records
or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, in each case, any Person or its
Representatives that has made or delivered to the Company a written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that was not
solicited in breach of Section 5.3(a), but only if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior
Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; and (B) the failure to take the actions contemplated by this Section
5.3(b) would be reasonably expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law. In connection with the
foregoing, the Company will (x) provide written notice to Parent promptly (within one Business Day) following the Company Board’s
determination referred to in the prior sentence and (y) substantially contemporaneously make available to Parent any non-public

such action being considered a violation of this Section 5.3); or (E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five Business Days in advance to the effect
that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has (A) so determined; and (B) resolved to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(d)(i), which notice will describe the Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and

during such five Business Day period, have (A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent
desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) no longer determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the
failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event would be reasonably expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to applicable Law; and (B) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a
presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent
requests to make such a presentation); or

Recommendation Change or termination, including the identity of the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal, the material

effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company and its Representatives, during the Notice
Period, have (1) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior
Proposal; and (2) permitted Parent and its Representatives to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this Agreement and
any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation), it being understood that (a) in the

any Person or Group related to making a potential Acquisition Proposal, is, to the Knowledge of the Company (which, for all purposes
of this clause (e), will be deemed to also include each member of the Company Board, the Company’s financial advisor and legal
counsel and will not be deemed to be only as of the date of this Agreement), received by, any non-public information is requested from,

must include (A) the identity of the Person or Group making such proposal, inquiry, request or offer; and (B) a summary of the material
terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry, request or offer and, if writing, a copy thereof together with all material documents
provided therewith. Thereafter, the Company must keep Parent reasonably informed, by providing notice by the later of (1) 24 hours

describes the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto will not, in any case, be deemed to be (1) a withholding, withdrawal,

designate any non-public information provided to any Governmental Authority as restricted to “outside counsel” only and any such
information will not be shared with the Representatives of the other Party without approval of the Party providing the non-public
information. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub may redact any valuation and related information before sharing any
information provided to any Governmental Authority with another Party on an “outside counsel” only basis. Notwithstanding anything

supplemented, an “Other Required Company Filing”), then the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and
file such Other Required Company Filing with the SEC. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement
and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules of the SEC and NYSE. Except in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change or thereafter, the

Parent Filing with the SEC without first providing the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon, and Parent will give due consideration to, and consider in good faith, all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
by the Company or its counsel.

statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant
is made by the Company with respect to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing. The information supplied by the Company
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Parent Filings will not, at the time that such
Proxy Statement or Other Required Parent Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under

Business Day following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Company Stockholders. Unless the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) has made a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company will (A) submit this Agreement for adoption by the
Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting; and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit (or cause to be solicited)
from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the matters to be considered at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

(b) Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company shall, and shall only, postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting if (i) there are holders of an insufficient number
of shares of Company Common Stock present or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum
and to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting; or (ii) the Company is required to postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law, order or a request from the SEC, including in order to give the
Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has sent to the Company
Stockholders or otherwise made available to the Company Stockholders by issuing a press release, filing materials with the SEC or
otherwise. Without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company Stockholder Meeting will not be postponed or adjourned (A) by
more than 10 calendar days at a time; or (B) with respect to Section 6.4(b)(i), by more than 30 calendar days after the date on which the
Company Stockholder Meeting was (or was required to be) originally scheduled. In no event will the record date of the Company
Stockholder Meeting be changed without Parent’s prior written consent, unless required by applicable Law.

Section 6.5. Financing.

(a) No Amendments to Financing Letters. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger
Sub will not permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Financing
Letters if such amendment, modification or waiver (i) reduces (or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of reducing) the
aggregate amount of the Financing, unless in the case of a reduction in the amount of the Financing, the Required Amount could still
be paid with the aggregate net proceeds of any remaining portion of the Financing and any debt financing under any new debt
commitment letter (such letter, a “Replacement Financing Letter”) that, were it structured as an amendment to

the Financing Letters, would otherwise satisfy this Section 6.5(a) and that would not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the
Closing or Parent’s ability to consummate the Financing, together with cash on hand at Parent to be made available by Parent at
Closing and cash on hand at the Company to be made available by the Company at Closing (such reduction, a “Financing Reduction
Exception”); (ii) imposes new or additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions
to the receipt of the Financing or any other terms to the Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or
prevent the Closing Date; or (B) make the timely funding of the Financing, or the satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing, less likely to occur; or (iii) adversely impacts the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Financing Letters or the definitive agreements with respect thereto (provided, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, Parent and Merger Sub may amend any Financing Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, book-runners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed such Financing Letter as of the date of this Agreement so long as the addition of such
parties, individually or in the aggregate, does not add new (or adversely modify any existing) conditions to the consummation of the
Financing and would not reasonably be expected to delay or prevent the Closing or Parent’s ability to consummate the Financing). Any
reference in this Agreement to (1) the “Financing” will include the financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as amended or
modified in compliance with this Section 6.5; and (2) “Financing Letters” will include such documents as amended or modified in
compliance with this Section 6.5. Parent will not release or consent to the termination of any individual lender under the Financing
Letters, except for (a) assignments and replacements of an individual lender under the terms of, and only in connection with, the
syndication of the Financing under the Financing Letters; (b) replacements of the Financing Letters with alternative financing
commitments pursuant to Section 6.5(d); (c) a reduction of commitments in respect of the facilities in an amount equal to the net cash
proceeds received by Parent or any of its domestic subsidiaries from the issuance of Senior Notes or any Loan Financing (each as
defined in the Financing Letters) to the extent contemplated by the Financing Letters; or (d) a Financing Reduction Exception; or (e)
the Financing Letters or definitive agreement are replaced at such time with a Replacement Financing Letter.

(b) Taking of Necessary Actions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will
use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to
arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Letters and any related Fee Letter on or prior
to the Closing Date in an amount sufficient to pay the Required Amount, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in
effect the Financing Letters in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof; (ii) negotiate, execute and deliver
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Letters on the terms and conditions contemplated
by the Financing Letters and related Fee Letter or, if applicable, any Replacement Financing Letter; (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions to funding that are applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Financing Letters and such definitive agreements thereto; (iv)
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing; (v) comply with its obligations pursuant to the Financing Letters; and (vi) if all
the conditions to the obligations of the Financing Sources contained in any Financing Letter have been satisfied (or upon funding will
be satisfied) or waived, enforce its rights pursuant to the Financing Letters to the extent that the failure to enforce would adversely
impact the amount or timing of the Financing or the availability of the Financing at Closing. Parent and Merger Sub will fully pay, or
cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees arising pursuant to the Financing Letters and any Fee Letters as and when they
become due. For the avoidance of doubt, the “reasonable best efforts” of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Section 6.5 includes
an obligation on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, if the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Letters have been satisfied
and one or more of the Financing Sources fails to provide its respective portion of the Financing and, as a result, the Closing does not
occur when required pursuant to this Agreement, to promptly commence an appropriate Legal Proceeding against any such breaching
Financing Source pursuant to which each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its reasonable best efforts to compel such breaching
Financing Source to provide its portion of the Financing.

(c) Information. Parent must (i) keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Financing (including any Alternate Financing under this Section 6.5); and (ii) provide the Company with copies
of all executed definitive agreements related to the Financing. Without

limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub must give the Company prompt notice (A) of any breach (or threatened
breach of a provision) or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice or lapse of time, or both, would reasonably
be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Financing Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing
of which Parent has Knowledge; (B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any written notice or communication from any
Financing Source with respect to any (1) actual or potential breach (or threatened breach), default, termination or repudiation by any
party to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing or any provisions of the Financing Letters or such
definitive agreements; or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among Parent or Merger Sub on the one hand and any parties
to the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing on the other hand (but excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any ordinary course negotiation with respect to the terms of the Financing); or (3) written notification by any of the parties to
the Financing Letters that they refuse to fund their commitments under the Financing Letters; and (C) if for any reason Parent at any
time believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Financing Letters or any definitive agreements related to the Financing; provided, however, that in no event will
Parent be under any obligation to disclose any information shared among Parent and its professional advisors in connection with
matters contemplated by clause (ii) that is subject to attorney-client privilege if Parent shall have used its reasonable best efforts to
disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege. Parent must provide any information reasonably requested by
the Company relating to any of the circumstances referred to in the previous sentence as soon as reasonably practical (but in any event
with two Business Days) after the date that the Company delivers a written request therefor to Parent.

(d) Alternate Financing. If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including any
market flex provisions) contemplated in the Financing Letters, then Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to arrange, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, (i) alternative financing from the same or alternative sources, on terms and
conditions not materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent and the Merger Sub than those contained in the Financing Letters
(including the flex provisions contained in the related fee letter) in an amount sufficient, together with other financial resources
available to Parent, to pay the Required Amount (the “Alternate Financing”); and (ii) one or more new financing commitment letters
(or other agreements) with respect to such Alternate Financing (the “New Financing Letters”), which New Financing Letters will
replace the existing Financing Letters in whole or in part. Parent will promptly provide a copy of any New Financing Letters (and any
fee letter in connection therewith, which may be delivered with the fee amounts redacted in a customary manner so long as no
redaction covers terms that would adversely affect the aggregate amount of net proceeds, conditionality, availability or termination of
the Alternate Financing) to the Company. In the event that any New Financing Letters or Replacement Financing Letter are obtained,
(A) any reference in this Agreement to the “Financing Letters” will be deemed to include the Financing Letters to the extent not
superseded by the New Financing Letters or Replacement Financing Letter, as applicable, at the time in question and any New
Financing Letters or Replacement Financing Letter, as applicable, to the extent then in effect; and (B) any reference in this Agreement
to the “Financing” will mean the debt financing contemplated by the Financing Letters as modified pursuant to the foregoing.

(e) Certain Agreements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Section 6.5 shall require, and in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent and/or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to
require, any of Parent or Merger Sub to (i) pay any fees to the lenders or increase any interest rates or original issue discounts
applicable to the Financing in excess of those contemplated in the Financing Letters, including any related fee letters (including the
flex provisions thereof), whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or otherwise, (ii) amend or waive any of the
terms or conditions hereof or under the Financing Letters or (iii) consummate the Closing at any time prior to the date determined in
accordance with Section 2.3.

Section 6.6. Financing Cooperation.

Company’s historical books and records); or (C) any financial information related to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any

Company or its Subsidiaries to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or create an unreasonable risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Nothing in this Section 6.6 will require (1) any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any

other confidential information provided by the Company or any of its Representatives to Parent or Merger Sub or their respective
Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that
Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Representatives will be permitted to disclose such information to any Financing Sources,
prospective Financing Sources that are or may become parties to the Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and
auditors) or Financing Source Related Parties, and any Financing Sources, prospective Financing Sources or Financing Source Related
Parties will be permitted to disclose such information, in each case subject to customary confidentiality undertakings entered into by
any Financing Sources, prospective Financing Sources or Financing Source Related Parties with Parent in connection with the
Financing.

(e) Reimbursement. Promptly upon request by the Company, Parent will reimburse the Company for any documented and
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including documented and reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees) incurred by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 6.6.

them in connection with their cooperation in arranging the Financing pursuant to this Agreement or the provision of information
utilized in connection therewith (including any action taken in accordance with this Section 6.6) and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than information provided specifically for use in connection with the Financing by or on behalf of the
Company or its Subsidiaries), or any Taxes incurred as a direct result of any the foregoing, in each case, except to the extent actually
suffered or incurred as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or material breach of this Agreement by, the Company
or its Subsidiaries or, in each case, their respective Representatives. Parent’s obligations pursuant to Section 6.6(e) and this
Section 6.6(f) are referred to collectively as the “Reimbursement Obligations”

(g) No Exclusive Arrangements. In no event will Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates (which for this

sources of Parent, Merger Sub and such investors) enter into any Contract prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank, investment bank
or other potential provider of financing from providing or seeking to provide financing or financial advisory services to any Person, in
each case in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or in connection with the Merger.

no “anti-takeover” Law is or becomes applicable to the Merger; and (b) if any “anti-takeover” Law becomes applicable to the Merger,
take all action within their power to ensure that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on the Merger.

Section 6.8. Access. At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing
until the earlier to occur of the (1) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and (2) Effective Time, the Company will
afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the
properties, books and records and personnel of the Company, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any
documents or information to the extent that (i) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such
documents or information; (ii) access to such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or information; provided, that the Company
shall inform Parent as to the general nature of what is being withheld as a result of the foregoing and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege; (iii) access to a Contract to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right to
terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract; provided, that the Company shall inform Parent as to the general nature of
what is being withheld as a result of the foregoing and shall use its reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that
would not contravene, cause a default under or give a third Person the right to terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to any
Contract (including, if practicable, by obtaining consent for the disclosure thereof from the applicable third Person); (iv) access would
result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of third Persons; or (v) such documents or information are reasonably pertinent to any
adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates, on the other hand.
Nothing in this Section 6.8 will be construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective
Representatives to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the
access contemplated by this Section 6.8 will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Company’s reasonable security
measures and insurance requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement will apply to any information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection with any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall agree on appropriate procedures concerning requests for access pursuant to this Section 6.8.

Section 6.9. Section 16(b) Exemption. The Company will take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the Merger, and any
dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities) in connection with the Merger by each individual who
is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.10. Directors’ and Officers’ Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) Indemnified Persons. Subject to Section 6.10(d), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill, in all respects to the extent permitted under applicable Law,
the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of their respective current or former directors, officers or employees (and any person who
becomes a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time), on the other hand
(collectively, the “Indemnified Persons”). In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses
that are at least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Charter, the
Bylaws and the other similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, as applicable, as of the date of this
Agreement. During such six-year period or such period in which an Indemnified Person is asserting a claim for

indemnification pursuant to Section 6.10(b), whichever is longer, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified
in any manner except as required by applicable Law.

(b) Indemnification Obligation. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.10(a) and subject to Section 6.10(d), during the
period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will
(and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law or
pursuant to any indemnification agreements with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries in effect as of the Effective Time, each
Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and investigation expenses), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement or compromise in connection with any Legal Proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent that such Legal Proceeding arises, directly or indirectly, out of or
pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Person’s capacity as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time); and (ii) the Merger, as well as any actions taken by
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub with respect thereto (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries insolvent). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.10(b), then the claim asserted in such notice will survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal Proceeding, (A) the
Surviving Corporation will have the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by electing
to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Person’s
entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto); (B) the Indemnified Persons will be entitled to retain their own counsel
selected by them (the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation), whether or not the Surviving Corporation
elects to control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding, which shall be limited to one counsel for all Indemnified Persons, unless in
the reasonable judgment of such counsel a conflict exists which would prevent such counsel from representing all Indemnified Persons,
in which case the Indemnified Person(s) that are the subject of such conflict will be entitled to retain one (unless there are further
conflicts in the reasonable judgment of such counsel) separate counsel (the fees and expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving
Corporation); (C) upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person to repay any amount if it is ultimately
determined by a court of appropriate jurisdiction after exhausting all appeals that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to
indemnification, the Surviving Corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of any counsel) as incurred
by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the
defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding
effected without his or her prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages for which the Surviving
Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect to, or otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified
Person pursuant to this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all
Indemnified Persons from all liability arising out of such Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to be made with respect to
whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal
counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and
expenses of which will be paid by the Surviving Corporation.

(c) D&O Insurance. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the D&O
Insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage,
conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are

equivalent to those of the D&O Insurance (provided, that Parent may substitute therefor policies with a carrier with comparable credit
ratings to the existing carrier of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to
the insured). In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the
“Maximum Annual Premium”). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then the
Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum
Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with a comparable credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, and in lieu of maintaining the D&O Insurance pursuant to this Section 6.10(c), the
Company may (or, if the Parent requests, the Company will) purchase a prepaid “tail” policy (a “Tail Policy”) with respect to the D&O
Insurance from an insurance carrier with a comparable credit rating as the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance
carrier so long as the annual cost for a Tail Policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the Company purchases a Tail
Policy prior to the Effective Time, then the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain
such a Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such a Tail Policy is in full
force and effect.

(d) Successors and Assigns. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation
or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each case, proper provisions will be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10.

(e) No Impairment. The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 may not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in
any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person (and their heirs and representatives) who is a
beneficiary pursuant to the D&O Insurance or a Tail Policy) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or
other person. Each of the Indemnified Persons or other persons (and their heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to
the D&O Insurance or a Tail Policy are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.10, with full rights of enforcement as if
a Party. The rights of the Indemnified Persons (and other persons (and their heirs and representatives) who are beneficiaries pursuant to
the D&O Insurance or a Tail Policy) pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that
such persons may have pursuant to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the
Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements entered into with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iv) applicable
Law.

(f) Joint and Several Obligations. The obligations of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Section 6.10 will be joint and several.

(g) Other Claims. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to
directors’ and officers’ insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy or indemnification agreement that is or has been in
existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it
being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.10 is not prior to or in substitution for any such
claims pursuant to such policies or agreements.

Section 6.11. Employee Matters.

(a) Change of Control Acknowledgement. Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees that a “change of control” (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of each of the Company Benefit Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time.

(b) Existing Arrangements. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to) honor all of the Company Benefit Plans and compensation and severance arrangements in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing will prohibit the Surviving
Corporation from amending or terminating any such Company Benefit Plans or compensation or severance arrangements in accordance
with their terms or if otherwise required pursuant to applicable Law.

(c) Employment; Benefits. For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain for the benefit of each
Continuing Employee the Company Benefit Plans and any other employee benefit plans (other than the opportunity to participate in
equity-based benefits, cash incentive, bonus, severance and, subject to Section 6.11(b), individual employment agreements) of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (the “Company Plans”) at benefit levels that are substantially equivalent to those in
effect at the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and provide compensation and benefits to each Continuing
Employee pursuant to such Company Plans; (ii) provide benefits to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are substantially
equivalent to those benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent (“Parent Plans”); or (iii) provide some combination of
Company Plans and Parent Plans such that each Continuing Employee receives benefits that, taken as a whole, in any case with respect
to clauses (i) through (iii), that are in the aggregate substantially equivalent to those benefits provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent. For a period of one year following the Effective Time for any Continuing Employee employed during that period, Parent
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, reduce the aggregate cash compensation, including base salary/base wages and target
incentive compensation opportunity, payable to such Continuing Employee. For a period of one year following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) provide
severance benefits that are substantially equivalent to those benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Affiliates; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall permit the Surviving Corporation or Parent at any time after the
Effective Time to unilaterally amend, terminate or rescind any severance or retention benefits, including change of control acceleration
of equity granted to an individual in a written agreement signed by the Company and such individual prior to the Effective Time
without such individual’s written consent or as explicitly permitted under the terms of such written agreement. The Company will
consult in good faith with Parent regarding the content of broadly disseminated communications to Company employees regarding the
Merger prior to the release of any such communications.

(d) New Plans. To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable Plan is made available to any Continuing Employee at or
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause to be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for
purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement), except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would
result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each Continuing
Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting period, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such plans, the “New Plans”) to the extent that
coverage pursuant to any New Plan replaces coverage pursuant to a comparable Company Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, the “Old Plans”); (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
agreements with respect to the benefit providers and insurers, for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical, vision, disability or other welfare benefits to any Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation will cause all
waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or limitations, physical examination requirements, evidence of insurability requirements and
actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, and the Surviving Corporation will cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date that such Continuing

Employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit pursuant to such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, co-payments, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and
(iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees pursuant to any New Plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused
balance in the account of such Continuing Employee; provided that Parent is provided with sufficient information following the
Effective Time to comply with applicable Law and the agreements with respect to the benefit providers and insurers. Any vacation or
paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such
Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, will not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture.

(e) New Equity Awards. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall grant Company RSUs to certain of the Continuing
Employees, in such amounts, and with such terms (including no acceleration in connection with the Merger or any subsequent event,
such as termination of employment) as specified by Parent, which grants shall only be effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Such Company RSUs shall be assumed and converted in accordance with Section 2.8(d).

(f) Termination of Benefit Plans. Except as otherwise requested by Parent, effective as of the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date, the Company shall terminate the Company Benefit Plans that is intended to qualify pursuant to Section 401(a) of the
Code (unless Parent provides written notice to the Company no later than 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date that such plans
shall not be terminated). The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such plans and the Company Stock Plans have been
terminated (effective no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Board or any
applicable committee thereof. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to reasonable and good faith review and
approval by Parent. The Company also shall (i) take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such 401(k) plans as Parent may
reasonably require, (ii) solely to the extent such 401(k) plans are terminated, satisfy and contribute the necessary amounts to satisfy any
end-of-year true-up on employee contributions that the Company has not fully “matched” pursuant to the Company’s “match”
obligations as if the Effective Time is the last date of such plan year; and (iii) cooperate with Parent with respect to the termination of
any other Company Plans that are “employee benefit plans” within the meaning of ERISA, to the extent terminable by the Company
without any action or consent of any other Person and without cost to the Company, which are identified by Parent.

(g) No Third Person Beneficiary Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither this
Section 6.11 nor any provisions of this Agreement relating to Company Benefit Plans will be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate
any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this Section 6.11,
require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Company Plan or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; or (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person.

Section 6.12. Obligations of Merger Sub. Parent will take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
to perform their respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub will be jointly and severally liable for the failure by either of them to
perform and discharge any of their respective covenants, agreements and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company;

(b) by either Parent or the Company if (i) any permanent injunction or other judgment or order issued by any court of
competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger will be in effect,
or any action has been taken by any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, that, in each case, prohibits, makes illegal or

Change;

(g) by the Company if Parent or Merger Sub has breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its respective

written notice of such breach, delivered at least 30 days prior to such termination, stating the Company’s intention to terminate this

Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, or the Financing Letters, which
rights, obligations and agreements will survive the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms.

Section 8.3. Fees and Expenses.

(a) General. Except as set forth in this Section 8.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger will be paid by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Payment Agent. Except as set forth in
Section 2.9(e), Parent will pay or cause to be paid all (i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees; and (ii) sales, use, gains, real
property transfer and other similar Taxes or fees, in each case arising out of or in connection with the consummation of the Merger.

(b) Company Payments.

(i) Future Transactions. If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or
Section 8.1(e); (B) at the time of such termination, the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b) and Section 7.1(c) (to the extent relating to
the matters set forth in Section 7.1(b)) have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied and the conditions set forth in Section 7.3(a)
and Section 7.3(b) would be satisfied if the date of such termination was the Closing Date; (C) prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), an Acquisition Proposal made or renewed after the date of this
Agreement has been publicly announced or publicly disclosed and not publicly withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (D) within one
year of the termination of this Agreement, either an Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive
agreement providing for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction and such Acquisition Transaction is subsequently
consummated (whether such consummation occurs before or after the one-year anniversary of such termination), then the Company
will, concurrently with the consummation of such Acquisition Transaction, pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee an amount
equal to $87,500,000 in cash (the “Termination Fee”) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent. For purposes of this Section 8.3(b), all references to “15%” and “85%” in the definition of
“Acquisition Transaction” will be deemed to be references to “50%.”

(ii) Company Board Recommendation Change. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(f),
then the Company must promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) following such termination pay or cause to be paid to
Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in
writing by Parent.

(iii) Superior Proposal. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(h), then the Company must
concurrently with such termination pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

(c) Single Payment Only. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable pursuant to more than one provision
of this Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events.

(d) Payments; Default. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the
Merger and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay any amount due pursuant to Section 8.3(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding
that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in Section 8.3(b) or any portion thereof then the Company will
pay or cause to be paid to Parent its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable and

annual rate equal to the prime rate (as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof

the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees
of each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates (the Persons in clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the
“Company Related Parties”) in respect of this Agreement and the Merger, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company
Related Parties will have any further monetary liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Sub relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Merger (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with respect to, and the Parties may be
entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality Agreement, Section 8.3(a) and Section 8.3(d), as applicable).

Section 8.4. Amendment. Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended
by the Parties at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
(pursuant to authorized action by the Company Board (or a committee thereof), except that if the Company has received the Requisite

expressly relating to the Financing Sources set forth in Section 6.6(a), Section 9.3, the last sentence of Section 9.6, Section 9.10(b),
Section 9.11 and this Section 8.4 (and the defined terms used therein) may not be amended, modified or altered in a manner that

benefit of such Party contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver will be valid

Section 9.3. Assignment. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder
without the prior written approval of the other Parties, except that Parent and Merger Sub will have the right to assign all or any portion
of their respective rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement from and after the Effective Time (a) in connection with a merger
or consolidation involving Parent or Merger Sub or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation; (b) to any of their respective Affiliates; or (c) to any Financing Source pursuant to the terms of the Financing

Letters; or (ii) impede or delay the consummation of the Merger or otherwise materially impede the rights of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. No assignment by any Party will relieve such Party of any of its obligations hereunder.

Section 9.4. Confidentiality. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge that Parent and the Company have
previously executed the Confidentiality Agreement, which will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective Representatives will hold and treat all documents and information concerning
the Merger in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 9.5. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Financing
Letters, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements

respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to, and will not, confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by Section 6.10; (b) if Parent or Merger Sub
wrongfully terminates or willfully breaches this Agreement, then, following the termination of this Agreement, the Company, to the
extent permitted by this Agreement, may seek damages and other relief (including equitable relief) on behalf of the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options (which Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree may include damages based on a decrease in share value or lost premium); and (c) from and after the Effective Time, the rights
of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards and Company Options to receive the merger

such claims will attach to such shares of the Company Common Stock, Company Stock-Based Awards or Company Options and

intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and agreed that the provisions expressly relating to the Financing
Sources set forth in Section 6.6(a), Section 8.4, Section 9.3, Section 9.10(b), Section 9.11 and this sentence will be enforceable by the
Financing Source Related Parties).

Section 9.7. Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and
effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of
the Parties. The Parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

Section 9.8. Remedies.

(a) Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a
Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this Agreement or by applicable Law on
such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

(b) Specific Performance.

(i) Irreparable Damage. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
any Party failing to take such actions as are required of it by this Agreement in order to consummate the Merger) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to seek an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement;
(B) the provisions of Section 8.3 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish
or otherwise impair in any respect any Party’s right to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief; and (C) the right
of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered
into this Agreement.

(ii) No Objections. The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on the
one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants, obligations and agreements of the Parties
pursuant to this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or other security.

Section 9.9. Governing Law. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware.

Section 9.10. Consent to Jurisdiction.

(a) General Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any

any Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in accordance with Section 9.2
or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, but nothing in this Section 9.10 will affect the right of any Party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by applicable Law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits itself
and its properties and assets in any Legal Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts in the event that any
dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement or the Merger; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any Chosen Court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection
with this Agreement or the Merger will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v) waives any objection that it
may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was brought
in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating
to this Agreement or the Merger in any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a
final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law. Parent (A) irrevocably designates Corporation Trust Company as its
agent and attorney-in-fact for the acceptance of service of process and making an appearance on its behalf in any Legal Proceeding and
for the taking of all such acts as may be necessary, proper or advisable in order to confer jurisdiction over it; and (B) stipulates that
such consent and appointment are irrevocable and coupled with an interest.

(b) Jurisdiction for Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the Parties
acknowledges and irrevocably agrees (i) that any Legal Proceeding, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, involving the Financing Sources or any Financing Source Related Party arising out of, or relating to, the Merger, the
Financing, the Financing Letters, or the performance of services thereunder or related will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
any state or federal court sitting in the State of New York in the borough of Manhattan and any appellate court thereof, and each Party
hereto submits for itself and its property with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not
to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Legal Proceeding in any other court; (iii)
that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in the
Financing Letters will be effective service of process against them for any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court; (iv) to
waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which any of them may now or hereafter have
to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such Legal Proceeding in any such
court; and (v) any such Legal Proceeding will be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York.
Without limiting the obligations of the Financing Sources under the Financing Letters and the rights of Parent and Merger Sub under
the Financing Letters, the Company acknowledges and agrees that no Financing Source Related Party shall have any liability or
obligation to the Company (or any of its Representatives) in connection with this Agreement or any transactions contemplated by this
Agreement if such Financing Source Related Party breaches or fails to perform (whether willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or
otherwise) any of its obligations under the Financing Letters and the Company (on behalf of itself and its Representatives) hereby
waives any rights or claims against each Financing Source Related Party in connection with this Agreement and the Financing, whether
at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and the Company (on behalf of itself and its Representatives) agrees not to commence
(and if commenced agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate) any action or proceeding against any Financing Source Related Party in
connection with this Agreement or any transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any action or proceeding relating to the
Financing). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (A) the interpretation of the definition of Company Material
Adverse Effect and whether or not a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred; (B) the determination of the accuracy of any
Specified Acquisition Agreement Representations (as defined in the Financing Letters) and whether as a result of any inaccuracy
thereof Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates has the right to terminate its obligations under this Agreement, or to decline to
consummate the Merger; and (C) the determination of whether the Merger has been consummated in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, in each case, will be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware.

Section 9.11. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT
MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF
CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE FINANCING LETTERS OR THE FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL
PROCEEDING INVOLVING OR AGAINST ANY FINANCING SOURCE RELATED PARTY). EACH PARTY

REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (c) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (d) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO

each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered by fax or .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an
“Electronic Delivery”), will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and will be considered to have the
same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the use of an
Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense,
except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

Section 9.13. No Limitation. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive
and effect cannot be given to both or all such provisions, (a) the representations, warranties, covenants and closing conditions in this
Agreement will be construed to be cumulative; (b) each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this Agreement
will be given full, separate and independent effect; and (c) nothing set forth in any provision in this Agreement will (except to the
extent expressly stated) in any way be deemed to limit the scope, applicability or effect of any other provision of this Agreement.

ANNEX B

Fairness Opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co.

November 20, 2016

Board of Directors
LifeLock, Inc.
60 East Rio Salado Parkway, Suite 400
Tempe, AZ 85281

Ladies and Gentlemen:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Symantec Corporation
(“Parent”) and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Shares”), of LifeLock, Inc.
(the “Company”) of the $24.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
November 20, 2016 (the “Agreement”), by and among Parent, L1116 Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and the
Company.

Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading,
research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities.
Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other
economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in
securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Parent,
any of their respective affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated
by the Agreement (the “Transaction”). We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and have participated in
certain of the negotiations leading to, the Transaction. We expect to receive fees for our services in connection with the Transaction, the
principal portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of
our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement. We may also in the future
provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Parent and their respective affiliates for which our Investment
Banking Division may receive compensation.

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to stockholders and Annual
Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the four fiscal years ended December 31, 2015; the Company’s Registration Statement on
Form S-1, including the prospectus contained therein dated September 27, 2012 relating to the Company’s initial public offering of
Shares; certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain other communications
from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and certain internal
financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for our use by the Company (the
“Forecasts”). We have also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the
past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading
activity for the Shares; compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain
other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations; and
performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.

For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of
the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming
any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We
have not

made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet
assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we have not been furnished with any such evaluation or
appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the
Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our
analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or
modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.

Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative merits of
the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal,
regulatory, tax or accounting matters. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than
Parent and its affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the $24.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the
Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement or
Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or entered into or amended in
connection with the Transaction, including, the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by,
the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or
nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such
persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the $24.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than Parent
and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the impact of the
Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company or Parent or the ability of the Company or Parent to pay their respective
obligations when they come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on,
and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming
this opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion
expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its
consideration of the Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote
with respect to such Transaction or any other matter. This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman, Sachs &
Co.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the $24.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the
holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

Very truly yours,
 
/s/ Goldman, Sachs & Co.
(GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.)

ANNEX C

SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE

§ 262 Appraisal rights

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger
or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery
of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As
used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean
and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a
depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited
with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph
(b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be
available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date
fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger
or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and
further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a
merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in §
251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or
consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in
respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository
receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a
national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of
this section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository
receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of
this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the
subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal
rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of

this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word
“amendment” substituted for the words “merger or consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words
“constituent corporation” and/or “surviving or resulting corporation.”

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in
which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate
of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e) and (g) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval
at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who
was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this
title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal
rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this
section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing
to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger
or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder
electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of
such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation
who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that
the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent
corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days
thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to
appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by §
251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice
did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall
send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of
stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or
(ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such
effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or,
in the case of a merger approved pursuant to §

Table of Contents

251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days
following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal
rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or
assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given
shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders
entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10
days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective
date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder
who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence
an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days
after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and
(d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from
the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with
respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement
shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is received by the
surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under
subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial
owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name,
file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed
by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the
surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be
given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the
City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication
shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who
hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the
pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the
constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss
the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless

Table of Contents

(1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2)
the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the
merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with
the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the
Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of
the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining
such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of
the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as
established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At
any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal
an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any,
between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid
at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal
proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders
entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to
subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights
under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of
uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the
certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced,
whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts,
to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in
subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the
effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time
provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written
withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after
the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of
the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding
in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand
for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

Table of Contents

1.2    From the Agreement Date until the Expiration Time and except pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, each
Stockholder, as to himself, herself or itself (severally and not jointly), agrees he, she or it shall not, directly or indirectly, grant any

recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction (collectively, the “New Shares”), shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if they constituted Shares and shall be deemed to be Shares
for the purposes hereof; provided, however, that a Stockholder shall be permitted to sell or net settle a sufficient number of Shares or
New Shares to cover the tax withholding obligations resulting from the vesting and conversion of Company RSUs or Company PRSAs
or the exercise of Company Options and to cover the payment of the exercise price related to the exercise of Company Options.

2.    Agreement to Vote Shares. From the Agreement Date until the Expiration Time, at every meeting of the Company
Stockholders called with respect to any of the following, and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, each Stockholder shall (as
to himself, herself or itself (severally and not jointly)) or shall cause the holder of record of any applicable record date to, be present (in
person or by proxy) and irrevocably and unconditionally vote (or consent to be voted) the shares of Company Capital Stock
beneficially owned by such Stockholder (the “Shares”) in respect of which such Stockholder is entitled to vote at any such meeting (a)
in favor of (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement; and (ii) approval of any proposal to adjourn or postpone the meeting to a later
date, if there are not sufficient votes for the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (b) in favor of any other matter considered at any such
meeting of the Company Stockholders that the Company Board has (A) determined is necessary or desirable for the consummation of
the Merger; (B) disclosed in the Proxy Statement or other written materials distributed to all Company Stockholders and (C)
recommended that the Company Stockholders adopt; and (c) against any Acquisition Proposal.

2.1    Proxy. Solely in the event of a failure by any Stockholder to act in accordance with such Stockholder’s obligations as
to voting pursuant to Section 2, such Stockholder hereby irrevocably (until the Expiration Time) grants to and appoints Parent as such
Stockholder’s proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of such Stockholder, to
represent, vote and otherwise act (by voting at any meeting of the Company Stockholders, by written consent in lieu thereof or
otherwise) with respect to the Shares owned or held by such Stockholder regarding the matters referred to in Section 2 until the
Expiration Time, to the same extent and with the same effect as such Stockholder might or could do under applicable law, rules and
regulations. The proxy granted pursuant to this Section 2.1 is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable until the Expiration
Time. Until the Expiration Time, such Stockholder will take such further action and will execute such other instruments as may be
necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy. Such Stockholder hereby revokes any and all previous proxies or powers of attorney
granted with respect to any of such Stockholder’s Shares that may have heretofore been appointed or granted with respect to the
matters referred to in this Section 2.1, and prior to the Expiration Time no subsequent proxy (whether revocable or irrevocable) or
power of attorney shall be given by such Stockholder, except as required by any election form or letter of transmittal in connection with
the Merger, or in connection with such Stockholder voting by proxy at the meeting of the Company Stockholders as contemplated by
Section 2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this proxy shall terminate upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

3.    Representations and Warranties of Stockholder. Each Stockholder hereby represents and warrants, as to himself, herself or
itself (severally and not jointly), to Parent as follows:

3.1    Securities. No person who is not a signatory to this Agreement (or such signatory’s spouse for purposes of applicable
community property Laws) has a beneficial interest in or a right to acquire or vote any of

perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Stockholder and the
consummation by such Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary action, if any,
on the part of such Stockholder. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Stockholder and constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of such Stockholder, enforceable against such Stockholder in accordance with its terms, subject only to the effect, if
any, of (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar law now or hereafter in effect relating to
creditors’ rights generally and (b) rules of law and equity governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies.

3.3    No Consents. No consent, approval, order, authorization, release or waiver of, or registration, declaration or filing
with, any Governmental Authority or other Person by or on behalf of such Stockholder is necessary or required to be made or obtained
by such Stockholder to enable such Stockholder to lawfully execute and deliver, enter into, and perform its, his or her obligations under
this Agreement except as has been made or obtained prior to the date of this Agreement.

3.4    No Conflict. The execution and delivery by such Stockholder of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (a) if such Stockholder is an entity, violate or conflict with any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other equivalent organizational or governing documents of such Stockholder, in each case as
amended to date, (b) violate, conflict with, result in the breach of, constitute a default (or an event that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would become a default) pursuant to, result in the loss of any benefit under, result in the termination of, accelerate the
performance required by, or result in a plan of termination or acceleration pursuant to any material Contract of such Stockholder
applicable to any of the Shares, (c) violate or conflict with any Law applicable to such Stockholder or by which the Shares are bound,
or (d) result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the Shares, in the case of clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d), in a manner that would
adversely affect the ability of such Stockholder, individually or in the aggregate, to perform his, her or its obligations under or
otherwise comply with this Agreement.

3.5    Legal Proceedings. There is no claim, action, charge, lawsuit, litigation or other similarly formal legal proceeding
brought by or pending before any Governmental Authority, arbitrator, mediator or other tribunal or, to such Stockholder’s knowledge,
investigation, in each case whether civil, criminal, administrative, judicial or investigative, or any appeal therefrom (each of the
foregoing, a “Legal Proceeding”) against such Stockholder that relates in any way to this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the
Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. To the knowledge of such Stockholder, no such Legal Proceeding
has been threatened and there is no reasonable basis for any such Legal Proceeding.

4.    Covenants of Stockholder. Each Stockholder hereby covenants, as to himself, herself or itself (severally and not jointly), to
Parent as follows:

4.1    Compliance. From the date of this Agreement and until the Expiration Time, such Stockholder shall not (a) knowingly
fail to act or take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of a representation or warranty contained herein,

consummation of the Merger.

Subsidiaries or in such Stockholder’s capacity as a trustee or fiduciary of any Company Employee Plan, and (b) nothing herein will be
construed to limit or affect any action or inaction by Stockholder or any representative of Stockholder, as applicable, serving on the

(ii) If to any Stockholder, at the address set forth below such Stockholder’s signature on the signature page executed
by such Stockholder.

5.3    Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief. The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent will be irreparably harmed and
that there will be no adequate remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of any Stockholder set forth herein.
Therefore, it is agreed that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available to Parent upon any such violation of this
Agreement, Parent shall have the right to enforce such covenants and agreements by injunctive relief, specific performance, or by any
other means available to Parent at law or in equity and each Stockholder hereby waives any and all defenses that could exist in its favor
in connection with such injunction or enforcement and waives any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection
with such injunction or enforcement.

5.4    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and
the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties hereto; it being understood that all parties hereto need not sign the same counterpart.

5.5    Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest; Assignment. This Agreement and the documents, instruments
and other agreements among the parties as contemplated by, referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto (a) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and (b) are not intended to confer, and shall not be
construed as conferring, upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. The representations and
warranties and covenants of each Stockholder contained herein shall not survive the Closing, and no claim may be brought with respect
to any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder following the Closing. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
otherwise, by any Stockholder without the prior written consent of Parent, and any such assignment or delegation that is not consented
to shall be null and void. Parent may assign this Agreement to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent without the
prior written consent of any Stockholder. Subject to the preceding two sentences, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by and against, the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns (including any Person to
whom any Shares are Transferred).

5.6    Amendment; Waiver. Subject to applicable Law, the parties hereto may amend this Agreement as it applies to each
Stockholder at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent and Stockholder. At any time,
either Parent or any Stockholder (as to himself, herself or itself) may, to the extent legally allowed, extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, as applicable, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of Parent or any Stockholder to any such waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the other. Without limiting the generality or effect of the
preceding sentence, no delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of such right, and no waiver of any
breach or default shall be deemed a waiver of any other breach or default of the same or any other provision herein.

5.7    Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect and shall be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto further agree to replace such
void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

5.8    Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a
party hereto shall be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred by this Agreement, or by applicable
Law on such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

5.9    Governing Law. The internal laws of the State of Delaware, irrespective of its conflicts of law principles, shall govern
the validity of this Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the interpretation and enforcement of the rights and duties of the
parties hereto. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts solely in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement and of the documents referred to herein, and in respect of the Merger, and hereby
waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or thereof, that
it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue
thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties
hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such Chosen Courts.
The parties hereto hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of
such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided
in Section 5.2 or in such other manner as may be permitted by any applicable Law shall be valid and sufficient service thereof.

5.10    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF
CONTRACT, TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTION OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT (a) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT
OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (b) IT UNDERSTANDS
