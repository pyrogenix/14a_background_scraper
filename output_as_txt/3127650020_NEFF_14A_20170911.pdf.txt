NOTICE OF ACTIONS TAKEN BY WRITTEN CONSENT AND APPRAISAL RIGHTS AND
INFORMATION STATEMENT

WE ARE NOT ASKING YOU FOR A PROXY AND
YOU ARE REQUESTED NOT TO SEND US A PROXY

September 11, 2017

To our Stockholders:

        This notice of actions taken by written consent and appraisal rights and information statement is being furnished to the stockholders
of Neff Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
August 16, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement") (a copy of which is attached as Annex A to the accompanying information statement), by and
among the Company, United Rentals (North America), Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and UR Merger Sub III Corporation, a
Delaware corporation and a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and subject
to the terms and conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company
continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Upon consummation of the Merger, each share of
Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Class A Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), after giving effect to the Exchanges (as defined below), shall be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to receive $25.00 in cash, without interest, less any deduction for withholding taxes required by
applicable law (the "Merger Consideration"). The Merger Consideration will not be paid in respect of (i) those shares of Class A Common
Stock held by the Company in treasury, (ii) those shares of Class A Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective subsidiaries and (iii) those shares of Class A Common Stock with respect to which appraisal rights have been
properly perfected and not withdrawn or otherwise lost in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the "DGCL").

        Immediately prior to the Effective Time and for no additional consideration in the Merger or otherwise, or other payments to them,
Wayzata Opportunities Fund II, L.P. and Wayzata Opportunities Fund Offshore II, L.P. (collectively, the "Key Holders") (two entities
controlled by Wayzata Investment Partners LLC which together beneficially own 14,951,625 shares of Class B Common Stock,
representing approximately 62.7% of the Common Stock, and 14,951,625 LLC Units (as defined below) of Neff Holdings (as defined
below)) and the holders (the "LLC Optionholders") of options ("LLC Options") to purchase LLC Units granted by Neff Holdings, have
separately and independently agreed with Neff Holdings, the Company and Parent, pursuant to that certain Exchange and Termination
Agreement, dated as of August 16, 2017, by and among Parent, the Key Holders, the Company and Neff Holdings LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ("Neff Holdings"), (the "Key Holder Exchange and
Termination Agreement") and that certain Exchange and Termination Agreement, dated as of August 16, 2017, by and among Parent, the
Company, Neff Holdings, the LLC Optionholders and Mark Irion (the "Management Representative") (the "LLC Optionholder Exchange
and Termination Agreement, and together with the Key Holder Exchange and Termination Agreement, the "Exchange and Termination
Agreements"), (i) in the case of the LLC Optionholders, to exercise the LLC Options on a cashless basis for LLC Units (after accounting
for withholding taxes and the applicable exercise price) (the "LLC Option Exercise"), (ii) to exchange (collectively, the "Exchanges")
100% of their common units (the "LLC Units") of Neff Holdings (including those LLC Units resulting from the LLC Option Exercise) for
shares of Class A Common Stock, (iii) to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement (as defined herein) and (iv) to terminate the
Registration Rights Agreement (as defined herein). Simultaneous with the Exchanges, all of the shares of Class B common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Class B Common Stock" and, together with Class A Common Stock, the "Common Stock") held

        After careful consideration, the board of directors of the Company (the "Board"), acting upon a unanimous recommendation of a
special committee comprised solely of disinterested directors, by a unanimous vote (a) determined that it is in the best interests of
Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents and to
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (b) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the
Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
and the other transaction documents, including the Merger in accordance with the DGCL, and (c) resolved, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, to recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of Company. As you
are likely aware, on July 14, 2017, the Company entered into a merger agreement (which we refer to as the "H&E Merger Agreement")
with H&E Equipment Services, Inc. (which we refer to as "H&E"), which provided for the acquisition of the Company by H&E. On
August 13, 2017, the Company received an acquisition proposal from Parent that the Board, acting upon the recommendation of a special
committee comprised solely of disinterested directors, and after consultation with the special committee's financial and legal advisors,
concluded that the proposal from Parent constituted a superior proposal as compared to the transactions contemplated by the H&E Merger
Agreement. On August 16, 2017, the Company terminated the H&E Merger Agreement in order to enter into the Merger Agreement with
Parent, and Parent paid H&E a termination fee of $13,165,000 in accordance with the H&E Merger Agreement on behalf of the Company.

        The adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of the Company required the affirmative vote or written consent of
stockholders holding in the aggregate a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, voting together as a
single class. On August 16, 2017, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Key Holders delivered a written consent
adopting and approving in all respects the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger (the
"Stockholder Consent"). As a result of the delivery of the Stockholder Consent, no further action by any stockholder of the Company is
required under applicable law or the Merger Agreement (or otherwise) to adopt the Merger Agreement or approve the Merger, and the
Company will not be soliciting your vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement and will not call a stockholders meeting for purposes
of voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

        This notice and the accompanying information statement shall constitute notice from the Company to the holders of record as
of August 16, 2017 of the action taken by the Stockholder Consent required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL.

        Under Section 262 of the DGCL, if the Merger is completed, subject to compliance by with the requirements of Section 262 of the
DGCL, holders of shares of Common Stock, other than the Key Holders who have consented to the adoption of the Merger Agreement and
waived their rights to appraisal under that certain support agreement, dated as of August 16, 2017, by and among the Key Holders and
Parent (the "Support Agreement"), will have the right to seek an appraisal for, and be paid the "fair value" (together with interest, if any)
of, their shares of Common Stock (as determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware) instead of receiving the Merger
Consideration. To exercise your appraisal rights, you must submit a written demand for an appraisal no later than twenty days after the
mailing of the accompanying information statement, which deadline is October 1, 2017, and comply precisely with other procedures set
forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, which are summarized in the accompanying information statement. A copy of Section 262 of the
DGCL is attached to the accompanying information statement as Annex F. This notice and the accompanying information statement
shall constitute notice from the Company to the holders of record as of September 7, 2017, the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to such notice, of the approval of the Merger and the availability of appraisal rights under Section 262(d)(2)
of the DGCL.

        We urge you to read the entire information statement carefully. Please do not send in your shares of Common Stock at this time. If the
Merger is completed, you will receive instructions regarding the surrender of your shares of Common Stock and payment for your shares
of Common Stock

        Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or
disapproved the Merger, passed upon the fairness of the Merger or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosures in this
notice or the accompanying information statement. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

        The accompanying information statement is dated September 11, 2017 and is first being mailed to stockholders on or about
September 11, 2017.

  BY ORDER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS,

  

 

Graham Hood
Chief Executive Officer

("Parent"), UR Merger Sub III Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Neff Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Company", "we," "us," and "our"), and for a more complete description of the legal terms of the
Merger, you should carefully read this entire information statement, the annexes attached to this information statement and the
documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this information statement. We have included page references in parentheses
to direct you to the appropriate place in this information statement for a more complete description of the topics presented in this
summary. All references in this information statement to terms defined in the notice to which this information statement is attached
have the meanings provided in that notice. All references to defined terms not defined herein or in the notice to which this

The Parties to the Merger Agreement (see page 19)

        Neff Corporation.    We are a leading regional equipment rental company in the United States, focused on the fast-growing
Sunbelt states. We offer a broad array of equipment rental solutions for our diverse customer base, including infrastructure, non-
residential construction, oil and gas and residential construction customers. Our broad fleet of equipment includes earthmoving,
material handling, aerial and other rental equipment, which we package together to meet the specific needs of our customers. As of
June 30, 2017, we operated 69 branches organized into operating clusters in five regions in the United States: Florida, Atlantic,
Central, Southeastern and Western. We are strategically located in areas that we believe feature high levels of population growth as
well as high levels of construction activity over the near term. We believe that our clustering approach enables us to establish a
strong local presence in targeted areas and meet the needs of our customers that have multiple projects within a specific region. As
of June 30, 2017, our rental fleet consisted of approximately 15,400 major units of equipment with an aggregate original equipment
cost ("OEC") of approximately $867.0 million and an average age of approximately 48 months. Our earthmoving fleet represented
approximately 54% of OEC and had an average age of approximately 44 months as of June 30, 2017. We believe that our focus on
earthmoving equipment positions us to take advantage of future growth opportunities in our key end-segments.

because it is the principal document governing the Merger.

surviving corporation, will survive the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

November 26, 2014 (and as amended), pursuant to which the parties thereto are entitled to certain rights with respect to the

Amendment of Neff Corporation 2014 Incentive Award Plan

        On August 16, 2017, the Board approved and adopted an amendment to the Neff Corporation 2014 Incentive Award Plan (the
"2014 Plan Amendment") providing additional protections in the event of termination without "cause" or resignation for "good
reason" as defined in the 2014 Plan Amendment after the consummation of the Merger. The 2014 Plan Amendment will become
effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. The previously announced amendment to the Neff Corporation
2014 Incentive Award Plan in connection with the proposed merger with H&E will not become effective. More information
regarding the 2014 Plan Amendment can be found in "The Merger—Interests of Certain of the Company's Directors and Named
Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Equity Awards" beginning on page 59.

Tax Deductions and Withholdings of Company Equity Awards

        Parent, the surviving corporation and their respective subsidiaries will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise payable to the holders of the Company Equity Awards such amounts that Parent, the surviving corporation or their
respective subsidiaries are required to withhold from such holders pursuant to applicable tax laws and remit such withheld and
deducted amounts to the applicable government entity on behalf of the applicable holders of the Company Equity Awards. For all
purposes of the Merger Agreement, such withheld and deducted amounts remitted to any applicable government entity as required
by applicable tax laws will be treated as having been paid to the applicable holders of the Company Equity Awards.

Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Company Board of Directors (see page 37)

        After careful consideration, the Board, acting upon a unanimous recommendation of a special committee comprised solely of
disinterested directors, by a unanimous vote (a) determined that it is in the best interests of Company and its stockholders, and
declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents and to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the Merger, (b) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and
the other transaction documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the other
transaction documents, including the Merger in accordance with the DGCL, and (c) resolved, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement, to recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of Company. Certain factors
considered by the Board in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement can be found in "The Merger—The Company's
Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 37.

Required Stockholder Approval for the Merger

        The adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders required the affirmative vote or written consent of stockholders of
the Company holding in the aggregate at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, voting
together as a single class. On August 16, 2017, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Key Holders
delivered a written consent adopting and approving in all respects the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger (the "Stockholder Consent"). No further action by any other Company stockholder is required under
applicable law or the Merger Agreement (or otherwise) in connection with the adoption of the Merger Agreement or approval of the
Merger. As a result of the delivery of the Stockholder Consent, the Company is not soliciting your vote for the adoption of the
Merger Agreement and will not call a stockholders' meeting for purposes of voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement. No
action by the stockholders of Parent is required to complete the Merger.

Table of Contents

        When actions are taken by written consent of less than all of the stockholders entitled to vote on a matter, Delaware law
requires notice of the action to those stockholders of record who did not consent in writing and who, if the action had been taken at
a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of such meeting had been the date that
sufficient written consents were delivered to the corporation. This information statement constitutes notice to you of action by
written consent as required by Delaware law.

Opinion of the Company's Financial Advisor (see page 41)

        In connection with the Merger Agreement and the Merger, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ("Deutsche Bank") on August 16,
2017 rendered a written opinion to the Board, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Deutsche Bank in preparing its
opinion, the merger consideration of $25.00 in cash per share to be received by the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock,
other than Parent and its affiliates and executive officers of the Company, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        The full text of Deutsche Bank's written opinion, dated August 16, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Deutsche Bank in
connection with the opinion, is included in this information statement as Annex E and is incorporated herein by reference. The
summary of Deutsche Bank's opinion set forth in this information statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
the opinion. Deutsche Bank's opinion was addressed to, and for the use and benefit of, the Board in connection with the approval of
the Merger Agreement. For more information regarding the opinion of the Company's financial advisor, see "Opinion of the
Company's Financial Advisor" beginning on page 41 of this information statement. Deutsche Bank's opinion is not a
recommendation as to how any holders of Class A Common Stock should have voted with respect to the Merger.

Interests of Certain of the Company's Directors and Named Executive Officers in the Merger (see page 51)

        You should be aware that certain of our directors and named executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are
different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally. These interests may create potential conflicts of interest. The
Special Committee and Board were aware of these potential conflicts of interest and considered them, among other matters, in
reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and to recommend that the Company's stockholders approve and adopt the
Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger.

        For a full disclosure of the interests of the Company's directors and named executive officers, including a description of their
employment agreements or letter and the amount of severance payment and benefits that such executive officers may be entitled to
receive, see "The Merger—Interests of Certain of the Company's Directors and Named Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning
on page 51.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (see page 80)

        The exchange of shares of Class A Common Stock for cash in the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction to U.S.
holders (as defined herein) for United States federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder whose shares of Class A
Common Stock are converted to cash in the Merger will recognize gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes in an
amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder's
adjusted tax basis in such shares, and a non-U.S. holder (as defined herein) whose shares of

Class A Common Stock are so converted generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any such gain or loss (except in
certain circumstances, as described more fully herein).

        You should read "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 80 for a more detailed
discussion of the United States federal income tax consequences of the Merger. Tax matters can be complicated and the tax
consequences of the Merger to you will depend on your particular tax situation.

        You should consult your tax advisor about the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of the Merger to
you.

Regulatory Waiting Periods and Approvals Required for the Merger (see page 57)

        Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), the Merger may not be
completed until the Company and Parent have filed notification and report forms with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. The
Company and Parent each intend to file a Notification and Report Form with the Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade
Commission and request early termination of the waiting period.

Expected Timing of the Merger

        We expect to complete the Merger by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. However, the Merger is subject to customary
conditions and it is possible that factors outside the control of the parties could result in the Merger being completed at a later time,
or not at all.

injunction shall have become final, binding and non-appealable; provided that this termination right shall not
be available to a party if the issuance of such final, binding and non-appealable law, injunction, order,

Table of Contents

Termination Fees (see page 74)

        Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain specified circumstances, the Company will be required to pay to
Parent a termination fee in the amount of $21,960,000. See "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees" beginning on page 74 for
a discussion of the circumstances under which such a termination fee will be required to be paid by the Company to Parent.

Financing (see page 68)

        The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to complete the Merger are not subject to any financing condition. Parent is funding
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement using a combination of cash, existing capacity under
its ABL facility and newly issued debt.

Specific Performance (see page 76)

        The Merger Agreement provides that, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, the parties
are entitled to specific performance of the terms of the Merger Agreement, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of the Merger Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement
(including the parties' obligation to consummate the Merger). The Merger Agreement also provides that Parent is responsible for the
performance by Merger Sub of its obligations under the Merger Agreement.

Procedures for Receiving the Merger Consideration (see page 61)

        Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will enter into an agreement with a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company. As
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event not later than ten (10) calendar days thereafter), the
paying agent will mail to each holder of record of Class A Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Class A Common Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on
any amount payable upon due surrender of Class A Common Stock.

Appraisal Rights (see page 83)

        Under the DGCL, if the Merger is consummated, Company stockholders who do not vote in favor of or consent to the adoption
of the Merger Agreement have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares in cash as determined by the Delaware
Court of Chancery, but only if they comply fully with all of the applicable requirements of the DGCL and do not otherwise lose
their appraisal rights. Any appraisal amount determined by the court could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the
Merger Consideration. Any Company stockholder intending to exercise appraisal rights must, among other things, submit a written
demand for appraisal to the Company within 20 days after the date of mailing of this information statement. A copy of Section 262
of the DGCL is included as Annex F to this information statement. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the
DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. Because of the complexity of the DGCL relating to appraisal rights, if you are
considering exercising your appraisal rights we encourage you to seek the advice of your own legal counsel.

Market Price of Our Class A Common Stock (see page 88)

        The Company's Class A Common Stock is listed on the NYSE under the trading symbol "NEFF." The closing sale price of the
Company's Class A Common Stock on the NYSE on July 13, 2017, which was the last trading day prior to the announcement of the
H&E Merger Agreement, was $19.70. The closing sale price of the Company's Class A Common Stock on the NYSE on August 15,

On September 8, 2017, the last practicable trading day before the date of this information statement, the closing price of the
Company's Class A Common Stock on the NYSE was $24.98.

Delisting and Deregistration of Our Class A Common Stock

        If the Merger is completed, the Company's Class A Common Stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the
Exchange Act. As such, the Company would no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of the Class A Common Stock
or otherwise.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER 

        The following questions and answers are intended to briefly address commonly asked questions as they pertain to the Merger
Agreement and the Merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder.
Please refer to the "Summary" beginning on page 1 and the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this information statement,
the annexes to this information statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this information statement, each of
which you should read carefully. You may obtain information incorporated by reference in this information statement without charge by
following the instructions in "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 93.

Q: What is the proposed transaction? 

A: The proposed transaction is the acquisition of the Company by Parent pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Once the closing
conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived and subject to the other terms and conditions in the Merger
Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company. The Company will be the surviving corporation in the Merger and
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. 

Q: What will I receive in the Merger? 

A: Merger Consideration 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, our stockholders will have the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, which is $25.00 in cash, without interest, less any deduction for withholding taxes required by
applicable law for each share of Class A Common Stock that they own immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Merger
Consideration will not be paid in respect of (i) those shares of Class A Common Stock held by the Company in treasury, (ii) those
shares of Class A Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries and
(iii) those shares of Class A Common Stock to which appraisal rights have been properly perfected and not withdrawn or otherwise
lost in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

Company Stock Options—Vested

Upon consummation of the Merger, each holder of vested Company Stock Options will receive an amount, in cash, without interest
and less applicable tax withholdings, equal to the product of (a) the Merger Consideration, minus the per share exercise price for
the Class A Common Stock issuable under such Company Stock Option (or portion thereof), multiplied by (b) the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) as of the Effective Time, less any
deduction for withholding taxes required by applicable law. For example, if an option holder owns a Company Stock Option to
purchase 100 shares of Class A Common Stock with an exercise price of $15.00 per share, it will, assuming the full per share
Merger Consideration of $25.00 per share, receive $1,000.00 in cash, less any deduction for withholding taxes required by
applicable law.

Company Stock Options—Unvested

Each holder of unvested Company Stock Options will receive a Substitute Stock Option to purchase a number of whole shares of
URI Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of shares of Class A
Common Stock that were issuable upon the exercise of the Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) in respect of which such
Substitute Stock Option was granted immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Each Substitute Stock
Option will have a per share exercise price for URI

of (i) the exercise price per share of Class A Common Stock applicable to the Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) in
respect of which such Substitute Stock Option was granted immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio.
Each Substitute Stock Option otherwise generally will have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as were applicable to
the Company Stock Option in respect of which such Substitute Stock Option was granted immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including as modified by the 2014 Plan Amendment).

Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards—Vested

Each holder of vested Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards will receive an amount, in cash, without interest and less applicable
tax withholdings, equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock
with respect to which such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award was so vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, less
any deduction for withholding taxes required by applicable law. For example, a holder of Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards
relating to 100 shares of Class A Common Stock that are vested immediately prior to the Effective Time will, assuming the full per
share Merger Consideration of $25.00 per share, receive $2,500.00 in cash, less any deduction for withholding taxes required by

such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award was unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange
Ratio, less any deduction for withholding taxes required by applicable law. Each Substitute RSU Award generally will be subject to
the same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, any time-based vesting schedule) as applied to the related Company
Restricted Stock Unit Award in respect of which such Substitute RSU Award was granted immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including as modified by the 2014 Plan Amendment), provided that any performance vesting condition will be waived.

Q: What happens if the Merger is not completed?

Merger. Instead, the Company will remain a publicly traded company, and shares of Class A Common Stock will continue to be
listed on the NYSE. 

Q: Why am I not being asked to vote on the Merger? 

A: Applicable Delaware law and the Merger Agreement require the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders in the aggregate
of at least a majority of the voting power of the

The requisite Company stockholder approval was obtained concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement on
August 16, 2017, when the Stockholder Consent was delivered by the Key Holders, which owned approximately 62.7% of the
Company's issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock on that date. Therefore, your vote is not required and is not being
sought. We are not asking you for a proxy, and you are requested not to send us a proxy.

Q: Why did I receive this information statement? 

A: Applicable laws and securities regulations require us to provide you with notice of the Stockholder Consent delivered by the Key
Holders, as well as other information regarding the Merger, even though your vote or consent is neither required nor requested to

Annex F. 

Q: What happened to the proposed merger agreement with H&E? 

A: On July 14, 2017, we entered into the H&E Merger Agreement which provided for the acquisition of the Company by H&E. On
August 13, 2017, we received an acquisition proposal from Parent that the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee, and after consultation with the special committee's legal and financial advisors, concluded that the proposal from URI
constituted a superior proposal as compared to the transactions contemplated by the H&E Merger Agreement. On August 16, 2017,
we terminated the H&E Merger Agreement and Parent paid H&E a termination fee of $13,165,000 in accordance with the H&E
Merger Agreement on our behalf. 

Q: Did the Board approve and recommend the Merger Agreement? 

A: Yes. The Board, acting upon a unanimous recommendation of a special committee of the Board comprised solely of disinterested
directors, unanimously:

Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the Merger, 

(b) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents, including
the Merger in accordance with the DGCL, and 

(c) resolved, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, to recommend adoption of the Merger
Agreement by the stockholders of Company. 

Q: What happens if I sell my shares before consummation of the Merger? 

A: If you transfer your shares of Class A Common Stock, you will have transferred the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be
received by the stockholders of the Company in the Merger. To receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares
through consummation of the Merger.

Class A Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. Please do NOT return your Class A Common Stock certificate(s) to the
Company at this time. 

Q: Do I need to take any actions now if my Class A Common Stock is held in book entry? 

A: No, you do NOT need to take any action with respect to your book entry Class A Common Stock at this time. 

Q: Is the Merger subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions? 

A: Yes. Before the Merger can be completed, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub must fulfill various closing conditions set forth in

Q: Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the Merger Consideration for my shares? 

A: Yes. As a holder of Common Stock, you are entitled to appraisal rights under the DGCL in connection with the Merger if you meet
certain conditions, which conditions are summarized in this information statement in "Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 83. 

Q: Will I owe taxes as a result of the Merger? 

A: The Merger will be a taxable transaction for all U.S. holders (as defined herein). As a result, assuming you are a U.S. holder, you
will recognize gain or loss with respect to the Merger equal to the difference between (a) the amount of cash you receive
(determined before any deduction for withholding taxes required by applicable law) and (b) the adjusted tax basis of your
surrendered shares of Class A Common Stock. 

If you are a non-U.S. holder (as defined herein), the Merger generally will not be a taxable transaction to you under United States
federal income tax laws, unless (a) you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 or more days during the
taxable year of such disposition and certain other conditions are met or (b) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a
trade or business in the United States by you, subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise.

See "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 80 for a more detailed explanation of the
tax consequences of the Merger. Tax matters can be complicated, and the tax consequences of the Merger to you will depend on
your particular tax situation. We urge you to consult your tax advisor on the tax consequences of the Merger to you.

        On August 16, 2017, the Board approved and adopted the 2014 Plan Amendment providing additional protections in the event of

Merger. The 2014 Plan Amendment will become effective immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger. The previously
announced amendment to the Neff Corporation 2014 Incentive Award Plan in connection with the proposed merger with H&E will not

Background of the Merger

Entry into the Merger Agreement with H&E

        As part of the ongoing evaluation of the Company's business, the Board and our senior management periodically review, consider and
assess the Company's operations, financial performance, prospects and industry conditions as they may affect our long-term strategic goals
and plans, including the consideration of potential opportunities for business combinations, dispositions, acquisitions and other financial
and strategic alternatives.

        On May 16, 2010, Neff Holdings Corp., the predecessor of the Company, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United State
Bankruptcy Code ("Chapter 11"). Neff Holdings was formed as a limited liability company on May 12, 2010 to acquire the assets and
operations of Neff Holdings Corp. The plan of reorganization of Neff Holdings Corp. became effective on October 1, 2010. Pursuant to the
plan of reorganization approved by the bankruptcy court, substantially all of our predecessor's assets were acquired by Neff Holdings and
its subsidiaries. Upon emergence from

Chapter 11, all of the equity of Neff Holdings was owned by Wayzata Opportunities Fund II, L.P ("Opportunities"), and Wayzata
Opportunities Fund Offshore II, L.P. ("Offshore" and, together with Opportunities, the "Key Holders").

        Prior to 2013, H&E and the Key Holders discussed a potential business combination transaction between Neff Holdings and H&E
and the benefits and risks of such a combination. In 2014, H&E made an offer to acquire Neff Holdings. At the time, Neff Holdings was
also exploring the possibility of conducting an initial public offering. The Key Holders, Neff Holdings and H&E negotiated extensively for
the potential acquisition of Neff Holdings by H&E but were unable to reach a mutually agreeable transaction. Ultimately, Neff Holdings
conducted an initial public offering. On August 18, 2014, the Key Holders formed the Company to serve as the issuer in the initial public
offering ("IPO") of the Company's Class A Common Stock. On November 26, 2014, the Company completed the IPO of 10,476,190
shares and issued and sold Class A Common Stock in exchange for net proceeds of approximately $146.1 million. A portion of the net
proceeds received by the Company from the IPO were used to purchase 10,476,190 common units in Neff Holdings, which were wholly
owned by the Key Holders prior to the IPO.

        On November 26, 2014, the Company entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement.

        On January 26, 2016, John Engquist ("Mr. Engquist"), Chief Executive Officer of H&E, met with Joseph Deignan, Partner of the Key
Holders and a director of the Company, to discuss a potential transaction between the Company and H&E. Discussions regarding a
potential transaction did not progress at such time.

        In October of 2016, Mark Irion ("Mr. Irion"), Chief Financial Officer of the Company, Graham Hood ("Mr. Hood"), President and
Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Mr. Engquist and Brad Barber, President and Chief Operating Officer of H&E, met to discuss a
potential transaction between the parties. During this meeting, the parties discussed general information about H&E and the Company,
based on publicly available information. Mr. Engquist indicated that H&E might be interested in exploring a possible acquisition of the
Company, but no specific terms were discussed.

        On October 14, 2016, the Company provided H&E with a draft of a confidentiality agreement (the "H&E Confidentiality
Agreement") in order to facilitate the exchange of confidential information between the Company and H&E. The parties negotiated the
terms of the H&E Confidentiality Agreement between October 14 and October 20, 2016. The H&E Confidentiality Agreement was
entered into on October 20, 2016.

        On November 6, 2016, pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company sent H&E various financial projections.

        On February 16, 2017, H&E indicated to the Company that a non-binding letter of intent with terms describing a proposed acquisition
of the Company would be forthcoming.

        On February 21, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Board was held with Mr. Irion present. Representatives of Akin Gump Strauss
Hauer & Feld LLP ("Akin Gump") were present for the purpose of discussing with the Board its fiduciary duties and the formation of a
special committee consisting solely of independent directors to evaluate a potential transaction with H&E or any other party, including a
potential sale of the Company.

        During the February 21 telephonic meeting, the Board determined that Mr. Hood, as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and
Mr. Deignan, due to his affiliation with the Key Holders, together constituting the majority stockholder of the Company and each a
counterparty to the Tax Receivable Agreement, may have interests that conflict with those of the other stockholders and, as a result, would
be excused from the remainder of the meeting. Mr. Irion also left the meeting. The remaining members of the Board then discussed the
potential interests of each director in connection

with a sale transaction and the potential composition of a special committee of the Board to consider a transaction (the "Special
Committee"), including that Messrs. Continenza and Singer hold options to acquire LLC Units of Neff Holdings and had certain rights
under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Messrs. Continenza and Singer agreed to waive any and all such rights under the Tax Receivable
Agreement with immediate effect. The remaining members of the Board then (i) determined that none of Mr. Continenza, Mr. Singer,
Gerard E. Holthaus, or Michael Sileck had, or was subject to, any interest which, in the opinion of the remaining members of the Board,
would interfere with the exercise by such director of his independent judgment as a member of the Special Committee and (ii) appointed
each of Messrs. Continenza, Singer, Holthaus, and Sileck as the members of the Special Committee, with Mr. Continenza to serve as
chairman of the Special Committee. The Special Committee was empowered to consider and take all action in connection with the
anticipated proposal from H&E, including the evaluation and negotiation of any transaction, the ability to reject the proposal and to
consider all other alternatives available to the Company. After the appointment of the Special Committee, the meeting of the Board
concluded and the Special Committee met. Among other things, the Special Committee discussed the engagement of, and engaged, Akin
Gump as counsel to the Special Committee.

        On February 24, 2017, H&E delivered to the Company a non-binding letter of intent, which included an offer to acquire the Company
on the basis of an enterprise value of $1.184 billion, inclusive of all debt and debt-like items and off-balance sheet liabilities (the "LOI").
The LOI requested an exclusivity period of up to 60 days. The purchase price was to be paid in cash or a combination of cash and common
stock of H&E, and the LOI did not include a specific per-share price. H&E was seeking to utilize its equity securities as consideration in
the transaction to reduce the financing needed for the potential transaction.

        On February 24, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump present. The
Special Committee discussed the terms of the LOI, including the proposed valuation and H&E's request for exclusivity. The Special
Committee discussed engaging a financial advisor and discussed the reputations and industry experience of several financial advisors,
including Deutsche Bank. The Special Committee authorized representatives of Akin Gump to schedule presentations from the proposed
financial advisors to the Special Committee.

        On March 2, 2017, the Special Committee formally engaged Richards, Layton & Finger, P.A. ("Richards Layton") as its special
Delaware counsel. Throughout the process, Akin Gump and the Special Committee consulted with Richards Layton on various issues
including Delaware law matters relating to the H&E Merger Agreement and the proposed transaction, as well as the fiduciary duties of the
Special Committee and the Board.

        On March 2 and March 3, 2017, the Special Committee interviewed potential financial advisors, including Deutsche Bank.
Representatives of the potential financial advisors discussed with the Special Committee their relevant industry experience, expertise and
familiarity with both the Company and H&E and certain other potential alternative acquirers and proposed fee structures.

        On March 6, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump present. The Special
Committee discussed the fee proposals received from two potential financial advisors, one of which was Deutsche Bank. The Special
Committee discussed the circumstances of a potential transaction involving the Company and its relation to ranges of financial advisor
fees. The Special Committee also discussed the valuation metrics that the prospective financial advisors proposed to use in order to
determine their proposed fee, including the use of a total enterprise value concept that would include any payments under the Tax
Receivable Agreement to the Key Holders. The Special Committee determined that payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement should
be excluded from any engagement fee calculation as they presented a potential conflict of interest for a financial advisor. The Special
Committee reviewed any potential conflicts the prospective

financial advisors may have had with respect to the potential transaction. After extensive discussion of the matter, the Special Committee
determined to engage Deutsche Bank as the financial advisor to the Special Committee based on its experience in merger and acquisition
transactions, including those with companies in the Company's industry, its proposed approach to the diligence and transaction evaluation
process, and other relevant factors, subject to satisfactory negotiation of terms. Over the next month representatives of the Special
Committee negotiated its engagement of Deutsche Bank as financial advisor, which was formalized by execution of an engagement letter
on April 5, 2017.

        From March 11 to March 15, 2017, at the direction of the Special Committee, Deutsche Bank participated in several phone calls with
H&E regarding the potential transaction as presented in the LOI, including items such as H&E's seriousness of interest and commitment to
the potential transaction, H&E's view of the timing of a potential transaction in the context of the economic cycle, the absence of a per
share price in the LOI, clarification of H&E's contemplated consideration mix and funding plan, the synergies that might be gained from
such a transaction, the value of certain benefits from step-up in tax basis that may be available to H&E in a transaction and the advisors
that H&E was working with. In these discussions, H&E indicated that it was willing to engage in a transaction for either all cash, or to
offer stockholders an option to receive common stock of H&E for up to 25% of the total consideration in the potential transaction to
permit stockholders the option to participate in H&E's future growth.

        On March 16, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank
present. Representatives of Deutsche Bank provided the Special Committee with a summary of their recent conversations with
Mr. Engquist and a member of H&E's board of directors. Representatives of Deutsche Bank and the Special Committee also discussed the
potential next steps in connection with evaluation of H&E's LOI.

        On March 27, 2017, the Company and H&E entered into an amended and restated H&E Confidentiality Agreement in order to make
the provisions of the existing H&E Confidentiality Agreement mutual and further facilitate the exchange of confidential information
between the parties.

        On March 27, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank
present. Representatives of Deutsche Bank updated the Special Committee with respect to its continued analysis of the structure of a
potential transaction and the potential value of certain benefits from step-up of tax basis that may be available to H&E and other potential
buyers in a transaction. Representatives of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump also discussed communication procedures for contacts among
H&E, Deutsche Bank, the Company and the Key Holders with the Special Committee. Representatives of Deutsche Bank and the Special
Committee discussed the timing and next steps of the transaction process including setting up a diligence meeting between the
management teams of the Company and H&E.

        On March 28, 2017, the management teams and financial advisors to the Special Committee and H&E met to discuss the potential
transaction and focused on the continued analysis of the synergies that could be gained from a combination of the Company and H&E.

        On March 29, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank
present. Representatives of Deutsche Bank reported on the meeting of March 28, including that H&E had informed Deutsche Bank of its
willingness to invest any additional resources in pursuing a potential transaction with the Company only after receiving a response to the
LOI from the Special Committee.

        On March 31, 2017, the Company granted access to the electronic dataroom to H&E's financial and legal advisors, Wells Fargo
Securities and Dechert LLP ("Dechert"), respectively.

        On April 3, 2017, Deutsche Bank sent a letter to the Special Committee describing certain relationships for consideration in
connection with the Special Committee's engagement of Deutsche

Bank as its financial advisor in connection with the potential transaction. The Special Committee subsequently reviewed such relationships
and determined that they were not material and would not affect Deutsche Bank's impartiality.

        On April 4, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank
present. Representatives of Deutsche Bank discussed with the Special Committee a preliminary financial analysis of H&E's proposal in the
context of the Company's strategic alternatives, including the value of debt-like items, the Company's current and historical stock trading
price, a preliminary valuation of the Company using various methodologies, H&E's ability to pay a higher value than that contained in its
proposal and an initial assessment of other potential parties being interested in a strategic transaction with the Company. Representatives
of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump discussed structural considerations to potentially enhance the value of the potential transaction for the
holders of Class A Common Stock with the Special Committee, including negotiating for a higher price per share to the holders of Class A
Common Stock from H&E, negotiating a payment to the Key Holders for termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement and accepting
common stock of H&E as a form of consideration. Representatives of Deutsche Bank also advised the Special Committee that H&E had
made clear that, as its offer in the LOI was based on an enterprise value for the Company, any separate payment to the Key Holders would
reduce the value of the potential transaction to holders of Class A Common Stock. Representatives of Deutsche Bank and the Special
Committee then discussed several proposed negotiating strategies and structures for the transaction and their relative merits, including
(i) an all-cash transaction, (ii) 100% cash proceeds for the holders of Class B Common Stock and an election by the holders of Class A
Common Stock of either cash or common stock of H&E (with flexibility to elect all cash and a potential limit on the total equity that could
be elected) and (iii) an election by the holders of Class A Common Stock and holders of Class B Common Stock of either cash or common
stock of H&E (with flexibility to elect all cash and a potential limit on the total equity that could be elected). Representatives of Deutsche
Bank and Akin Gump also discussed with the Special Committee the possibility of entering into an exclusivity period with H&E in
exchange for a go-shop marketing period after signing a definitive merger agreement with respect to the potential transaction.
Representatives of Deutsche Bank also advised the Special Committee that it should seek a higher price per share from H&E.

        On April 6, 2017, representatives of Deutsche Bank, acting on behalf of and at the direction of the Special Committee, held a
conference call with representatives of the Key Holders to provide an update on recent interactions with H&E, recent market
developments, certain sensitivities with respect to standalone obligations of the Company in connection with the Tax Receivable
Agreement, the potential impact of any payments made with respect to the termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement on the
consideration available to holders of Class A Common Stock in the transaction, potential transaction structures and their value implications
for holders of Class A Common Stock and the strategy to engage with H&E. Representatives of the Key Holders communicated to
Deutsche Bank its willingness to waive their rights in connection with the Tax Receivable Agreement in exchange for a payment to be
made at or after closing. Representatives of the Key Holders also expressed a willingness to consider receiving cash or H&E's common
stock as consideration for their LLC Units as part of a transaction, but expressed a preference for cash.

        On April 10, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank
present. Representatives of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump updated the Special Committee on its call with representatives of the Key
Holders and discussed a proposed response letter to H&E, a draft of which had been distributed in advance to the members of the Special
Committee.

        On April 11, 2017, on behalf of and at the direction of the Special Committee, representatives of Deutsche Bank sent a letter to H&E
responding to H&E's acquisition proposal stating, among other things, that the proposed enterprise value of $1.184 billion in the LOI was
inadequate. The letter also

included a request for an updated proposal from H&E, including, among other things, a specific price per share of Class A Common Stock
and Class B Common Stock, the maximum number of shares of H&E's common stock that H&E was prepared to offer as consideration in
the transaction, specific details on H&E's financing plan with respect to the proposed transaction and timeline clarification, including the
amount of time needed to complete H&E's outstanding diligence. With respect to the Tax Receivable Agreement, the letter indicated that
the Key Holders were willing to negotiate a payment in connection with waiving their rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement.

        On April 27, 2017, H&E submitted a revised offer letter (the "Second LOI") proposing to pay $20.90 a share, representing an
increased enterprise value of $1.209 billion, to acquire the Company, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Second LOI
including the requirement of an exclusivity period of sixty (60) days. This per share price assumed the cancellation of the Tax Receivable
Agreement without payment of any consideration. In the Second LOI, H&E reiterated that the consideration could be paid in cash or a
combination of cash and H&E's common stock.

        On May 1, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank
present. Representatives of Deutsche Bank discussed various aspects of the transaction, including a review of key process updates, an
update of certain publicly traded peers of the Company (both current and prior to the last U.S. election), certain updates to Company
forecasts furnished by Company management, the proposed purchase price included in the Second LOI and a preliminary financial
analysis, structuring of the proposed consideration, timeline of a potential transaction with H&E and H&E's financing requirements.
Representatives of Deutsche Bank and the Special Committee also discussed the potential interest of other bidders for the Company and
the risks to the Company of conducting a pre-signing auction process, including the possibility that H&E would not participate in such a
process. Representatives of Akin Gump and the Special Committee discussed certain aspects of foregoing a pre-signing market check,
negotiating with H&E for a go-shop period and related matters. After extensive discussion, the Special Committee determined to engage
other potential bidders in a go-shop process rather than a pre-signing market check. Representatives of Deutsche Bank discussed with the
Special Committee possible next steps in the process, including the advisability of an in person meeting between the principals of H&E
and the Special Committee and their respective financial and legal advisors. The Special Committee also authorized Deutsche Bank to
assist the Special Committee in engaging a third party tax advisor to analyze the potential value of certain benefits from a step-up in tax
basis to H&E in an acquisition transaction involving the Company and to assist in tax structuring matters related to the potential
transaction.

        On May 1, 2017, the Special Committee engaged KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as a third party tax advisor.

        On May 4, 2017, Messrs. Continenza, Singer and Holthaus along with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank met with
representatives of H&E along with representatives of Dechert and Wells Fargo Securities in New York. At this meeting, the Special
Committee and its advisors stated that H&E needed to increase its purchase price, provide further clarity on consideration mix and its
financing plan, agree to a specific performance provision in any definitive agreement to be executed between the Company and H&E and
conveyed its willingness to grant exclusivity to H&E in exchange for a go-shop provision in any definitive agreement to be executed
between the Company and H&E with respect to the potential transaction.

        On May 12, 2017, the management teams of H&E and Company met in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to discuss various financial
diligence matters, including synergies in a potential acquisition.

        On May 15, 2017, H&E submitted an updated proposal to the Company (the "Third LOI"), which included an increased price of
$21.15 per share (representing an increased enterprise value of $1.2335 billion), details on certain assumptions used in preparing the
proposal, a requirement for an exclusivity period of 45 days (reduced from the prior request of 60 days) and clarifying details on

H&E's financing plan and indicated a willingness to implement a mixed stock and cash consideration transaction with an election
component that would allow holders of Class A Common Stock to elect to receive shares of H&E's common stock, subject to a limit on the
total amount of stock received by such stockholders. H&E also confirmed its willingness to agree to a customary go-shop period. Once
again, the per share price assumed the cancellation of the Tax Receivable Agreement without payment of any consideration

        On May 16, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank
present. Representatives of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump discussed H&E's requirement for an exclusivity period extensively with the
Special Committee, with considerations including (i) that a pre-signing market check would be unlikely to yield beneficial results and
could cause H&E to abandon a proposed transaction with the Company, (ii) requiring a go-shop period post-signing in exchange for
granting exclusivity, and (iii) the viability of a robust market check during the go-shop period. After extensive discussion of the foregoing
representatives of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump, the Special Committee authorized its representatives to agree to granting H&E an
exclusivity period in exchange for agreement to a customary go-shop to be included in any definitive agreement that may be executed with
H&E.

        On May 17, 2017, Deutsche Bank, pursuant to the requirements of the Special Committee, sent a letter to the Special Committee
providing an update with respect to certain relationships as part of the Special Committee's ongoing evaluation of potential conflicts to its
engagement by the Special Committee as its financial advisor in connection with the potential transaction.

        On May 19, 2017, the Company entered into an exclusivity agreement with H&E (the "Exclusivity Agreement") pursuant to which
the Company agreed to negotiate exclusively with H&E until June 28, 2017, subject to automatic extension if the Company did not
affirmatively terminate exclusivity on or after such date.

        On May 22, 2017, Dechert circulated a preliminary due diligence request list to Akin Gump. From this date through the signing of the
H&E Merger Agreement, Dechert continued to deliver due diligence requests to Akin Gump.

        On May 23, 2017, Akin Gump sent the Special Committee a summary term sheet identifying key commercial and legal terms of the
draft H&E Merger Agreement, including, among other items, the deal structure, go-shop provisions and termination rights.

        On May 25, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump, Deutsche Bank and
Richards Layton present. During this meeting, Akin Gump walked the Special Committee through the proposed terms of a draft H&E
Merger Agreement with H&E.

        Akin Gump discussed the engagement of KPMG by H&E to perform financial due diligence in connection with the proposed
transaction, which presented a potential conflict of interest in the proposed transaction because KPMG had been previously retained by the
Special Committee as a tax advisor. Representatives of Richards Layton and Akin Gump briefed the Special Committee on potential
conflicts of interest in the proposed transaction with respect to KPMG in its capacity as tax advisor to the Special Committee.
Representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank discussed KPMG's value to the Special Committee in the process, including (i) tax
expertise to respond to H&E's diligence requests, (ii) the provision of independent tax advice to the Special Committee, including with
regards to potential tax structures for the proposed transaction with H&E and the Tax Receivable Agreement and (iii) the provision of tax
expertise to engage other potential parties in the go-shop period. After extensive discussion on the matter and consideration of the factors
described above, the Special Committee agreed to waive any potential conflicts of interest with respect to KPMG, subject to KPMG
establishing customary information barriers which the Special Committee believed would

adequately protect the Company's interests, and authorized the Company to execute any necessary waiver documents.

        On May 26, 2017, the Company and H&E entered into an amendment to the H&E Confidentiality Agreement providing for a "clean
room" to facilitate the sharing of certain potentially competitively sensitive information.

        On May 30, 2017, Akin Gump sent a draft of the H&E Merger Agreement to Dechert.

        On May 31, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank
present. The Special Committee asked a number of questions regarding the diligence completed to date, and Deutsche Bank responded to
such questions. Akin Gump discussed next steps in the potential transaction, including the drafting of a stockholder voting agreement and
unit purchase agreement.

        On June 7, 2017, representatives of H&E communicated to Mr. Continenza that H&E had concluded that offering holders of Class A
Common Stock the option to receive shares of H&E's common stock as consideration in the transaction would complicate H&E's
financing of the transaction and delay reaching and closing a transaction and was no longer acceptable to H&E. H&E confirmed that its
offer was now for an all cash transaction at the $21.15 per share price on the basis of and as outlined in its May 15, 2017 letter.

        On June 7, 2017, the Company and H&E entered into an amendment to the H&E Confidentiality Agreement in order to permit H&E's
debt financing sources to receive confidential information upon signing a joinder to the H&E Confidentiality Agreement.

        On June 7, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank
present. Representatives of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump discussed that H&E had informed Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump of H&E's
unwillingness to include shares of H&E's common stock as consideration in the transaction, that the receipt of H&E's common stock in the
transaction would likely be taxable given the mix of consideration and that an all-cash offer at $21.15 per share remained attractive with
the potential to deliver speed and certainty of outcome to holders of Class A Common Stock. Akin Gump informed the board that the Key
Holders engaged Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP ("Stroock") as its legal counsel and noted that Stroock had been engaged by the
Company in the past. The Special Committee discussed the engagement and agreed to waive any conflicts of interest related to this
engagement and agreed that they had no objection to the Key Holders' engagement of Stroock, as the Special Committee believed this
engagement was not adverse to the Company's interests. Representatives of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump and the Special Committee
discussed next steps in the transaction process.

        On June 9, 2017, Dechert sent a revised draft of the H&E Merger Agreement to Akin Gump.

        On June 13, 2017, representatives of Akin Gump prepared and distributed to the Special Committee a summary of various issues
contained in Dechert's draft of the H&E Merger Agreement. These issues included, among other items, (i) a structure under which the Key
Holders would deliver a stockholder written consent providing for the adoption of the Merger Agreement instead of providing for a
stockholders' meeting at which the stockholders would vote on the adoption of the H&E Merger Agreement; (ii) the proposed entry into
exchange agreements instead of a direct purchase of limited liability company units of Neff Holdings, (iii) the treatment of the Company's
outstanding equity awards in the merger, (iv) the drop dead date for consummating the transaction and (v) an all cash consideration
structure instead of part cash and part equity. Dechert's draft also indicated that H&E expected that the Tax Receivable Agreement would
be terminated in connection with the consummation of the Merger without consideration.

        On June 14, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank
present. Akin Gump discussed the receipt of a revised draft of the H&E Merger Agreement from Dechert, which was distributed to the
Special Committee prior to the meeting together with the summary of issues described above. Akin Gump walked the Special Committee
through certain issues in the H&E Merger Agreement, and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump and the Special Committee
extensively discussed such issues.

        Over the next several days, representatives of the Company and H&E continued negotiations of the H&E Merger Agreement and

H&E (the "H&E Support Agreement") and the Exchange and Termination Agreement, dated as of July 14, 2017, by and among H&E, the

        On June 17, 2017, Dechert sent a draft of the H&E Exchange and Termination Agreements to Akin Gump and Stroock. The
Exchange and Termination Agreements provided, as had been indicated previously in the Second LOI, the Third LOI and H&E's revised
draft of the H&E Merger Agreement, for the termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement for no consideration to the Key Holders or any
optionholders of Neff Holdings and the Key Holders or any optionholders of Neff Holdings accepted such proposal without further
negotiation. Dechert and Stroock continued to negotiate the H&E Support Agreement and the H&E Exchange and Termination
Agreements through the signing of the H&E Merger Agreement.

        On June 20, 2017, Dechert sent a further revised draft of the H&E Merger Agreement to Akin Gump.

office of Akin Gump in New York, New York. Representatives of Richards Layton participated via teleconference. Akin Gump discussed
the receipt of a revised draft of the H&E Merger Agreement from H&E and reviewed various issues in the H&E Merger Agreement,
including, among others, (i) the ability of the Company to recover damages from H&E in the event of a breach of the H&E Merger
Agreement by H&E (ii) enforcement rights with regards to H&E's financing commitment letters and (iii) the drop dead date. The Special
Committee and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump also discussed the proposed treatment of the Company's outstanding
equity awards under the H&E Merger Agreement.

        A representative of Deutsche Bank discussed with the Special Committee their preliminary financial analysis of the proposed
transaction.

Company's equity awards, H&E's required antitrust efforts, remedies under the H&E Merger Agreement, the drop dead date and the
Company's recent financial performance.

        On June 22, 2017, a meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank present.
Akin Gump reviewed with the Special Committee a summary of the terms of the Company's outstanding equity awards and H&E's
proposed treatment of such equity awards in the Merger. The Special Committee discussed the merits of the proposal with representatives
of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump. After extensive discussion on the matter, the Special Committee determined to propose a revision of
the treatment of unvested options and equity awards whereby (i) unvested options rollover but vest in the event of a termination of
employment without cause or for "good reason" and (ii) performance based-awards rollover but vest in the event of a termination and any
performance criteria thereunder is deemed to be satisfied so that such awards would be subject to time-vesting.

        On June 22, 2017, Akin Gump sent a further revised draft of the H&E Merger Agreement to Dechert, which included the items
discussed with the Special Committee.

        On June 23, 2017, a member of H&E's board of directors informed a representative of Deutsche Bank that H&E had decided to delay
moving forward with the potential transaction until the Company's second quarter financial information was available for review.

        On June 23, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank
present. The Special Committee and representatives of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump discussed the information conveyed by the H&E
director to Deutsche Bank and also engaged in extensive discussion on whether or not to allow the exclusivity period with H&E to
continue or to terminate exclusivity on June 28, 2017. The Special Committee decided to schedule a call with Mr. Irion in order to get an
update on the Company's quarterly performance.

        On June 25, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank
present. Mr. Irion discussed the Company forecasts that had been reviewed by H&E to date and the Company's second quarter financial
results and responded to questions from the Special Committee with respect thereto. The Special Committee and representatives of
Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump discussed the advisability of allowing its exclusivity agreement with H&E to continue in light of the delay
based on H&E's desire to wait for the release of second quarter financial results to H&E to proceed with the transaction. Representatives of
Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump and the Special Committee discussed alternatives for responding to H&E. After extensive discussion on
the matter, the Special Committee authorized representatives of Deutsche Bank to respond to H&E with a proposal to allow the exclusivity
period with H&E to continue until the Company's second quarter financial results were available for review and to reach an agreement
with H&E on the go-shop terms and the termination fee for termination during the go-shop period under the H&E Merger Agreement.

        On June 26, 2017, Deutsche Bank, pursuant to the requirements of the Special Committee, sent a letter to the Special Committee
providing an update with respect to certain relationships as part of the Special Committee's ongoing evaluation of potential conflicts to its
engagement by the Special Committee as its financial advisor in connection with the potential transaction.

        On July 3, 2017, Dechert sent a further revised draft of the H&E Merger Agreement to Akin Gump.

        On July 5, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump, Deutsche Bank and
Richards Layton present. Akin Gump discussed the receipt of a revised draft of the H&E Merger Agreement from Dechert. A
representative of Akin Gump walked the Special Committee through certain issues with respect to the H&E Merger Agreement, including,
(i) the go-shop provisions and related termination fees, (ii) antitrust requirements in connection with

the proposed transaction and the interaction of the antitrust process timeline and the drop dead date under the H&E Merger Agreement and
(iii) the treatment of outstanding Company Equity Awards in the Merger. Representatives of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump and the
Special Committee extensively discussed such issues. A representative of Deutsche Bank discussed market practice in connection with the
go-shop period and termination fees.

        On July 7, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank
present. Mr. Irion reviewed the Company's second quarter financial results with the Special Committee, noting that the results were higher
than had been previously communicated to H&E. After extensive discussion on the matter, the Special Committee authorized Deutsche
Bank to send the financial results to H&E.

        On July 9, 2017, Akin Gump sent a further revised draft of the H&E Merger Agreement to Dechert.

        The Company and H&E continued to negotiate the terms and conditions of the H&E Merger Agreement with representatives of Akin
Gump and Dechert between July 9, 2017 and July 13, 2017. During this time, Dechert, Wells Fargo Securities and H&E finalized their
diligence, and the Company, with the assistance of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump, responded to final diligence requests and questions.

        On July 11, 2017, a member of H&E's board of directors informed a representative of Deutsche Bank that H&E's due diligence had
revealed a reduction in the Company's 2017 estimated EBITDA, softening of second quarter rental revenue relative to Company forecasts,
a meaningful investment required to bring the Company's fleet and the rolling stock's age in line with industry averages, and significantly
higher financing costs than initially anticipated. Notwithstanding the above, H&E was still prepared to offer a purchase price of $21.15 in
cash per share of Class A Common Stock. A member of H&E's board of directors informed the representative of Deutsche Bank that,
given these due diligence findings, H&E had no room to incur additional costs or offer additional consideration with respect to the
transaction and that this offer represented H&E's "best and final" offer. This purchase price was contingent on the Company agreeing to
rollover unvested Company Equity Awards without post termination protections, and on a six-month outside date after which the H&E
Merger Agreement could be terminated if the conditions to closing had not been waived or satisfied. Dechert subsequently sent a further
revised draft of the H&E Merger Agreement to Akin Gump reflecting these terms.

        On July 11, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank
present. Representatives of Deutsche Bank informed the Special Committee of its conversation with a member of H&E's board of directors
and also discussed with the Special Committee the outstanding issues raised by the revised H&E Merger Agreement, including (i) HSR
Act approval and the six-month outside date proposed by H&E, including that H&E would incur additional financing costs in connection
with extending its financing commitments beyond the six-month timeframe and (ii) the treatment of unvested Company Equity Awards.
The Special Committee and representatives of Deutsche Bank discussed how gaining concessions from H&E on these three issues would
increase the financial cost of the transaction to H&E and therefore would likely not be acceptable to H&E based upon the H&E director's
characterization of H&E's offer of $21.15 in cash per share of Class A Common Stock as its "best and final" offer.

        On July 12, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump and Deutsche Bank
present. The parties discussed the economic impact of H&E's revised proposal for the treatment of Company Equity Awards. The parties
also discussed H&E's proposal for a six month outside date and the risk that the Merger may not be consummated within that period of
time in the event of an extended antitrust review process. The parties also discussed the option of including an adjustment mechanism in
the H&E Merger Agreement to reduce the per share price to compensate H&E for any incremental costs incurred in connection with the
extension of H&E's

financing commitments beyond six months, in response to H&E's communication that $21.15 per share represented its "best and final"
offer and that H&E would be unwilling to incur any incremental financing costs associated with extending the financing commitment
beyond six months.

        On July 13, 2017, Deutsche Bank, pursuant to the requirement of the Special Committee, sent a letter to the Special Committee
providing an update with respect to certain relationships as part of the Special Committee's potential conflicts to its engagement by the
Special Committee as its financial advisor in connection with the potential transaction.

        On the afternoon of July 13, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Akin Gump,
Deutsche Bank and Richards Layton present. Representatives of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump informed the Special Committee that
H&E and representatives of Wells Fargo Securities and Dechert had conveyed to representatives of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump that
extending H&E's financing commitment would result in an additional upfront cost of approximately $2 million and up to an additional
$11 million between six and nine months of signing, and that H&E insisted that if the outside date was to be extended from six months to
nine months, these costs would need to be reflected as a reduction in the per share merger consideration. The Special Committee
extensively discussed the increased certainty of the consummation of the transaction that would result from an extension of the outside
date from six to nine months. The Special Committee discussed with representatives of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump the resulting price
calculations, which resulted in a revised price of $21.07 per share (reflecting a $0.08 per share reduction to account for the approximately
$2 million additional upfront cost to H&E in connection with its financing) and a reduction of up to $0.44 per share for the remaining
financing costs (such downward adjustment from the purchase price to be made only by the amount, if any, by which such costs were
actually realized by H&E).

        On the evening of July 13, 2017, the Special Committee met to consider the transaction at $21.07 per share (subject to the downward
adjustments for certain financing costs realized by H&E if the transaction is not consummated prior to January 15, 2018, but in no case
less than $20.63 per share), receive an update on the status of negotiations with H&E by each of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump, and
consult with each of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump about the legal and financial aspects of the transaction. Akin Gump provided the
Special Committee with an overview of its fiduciary duties in connection with the transaction. Akin Gump presented the Special
Committee with a summary of the terms and conditions of the H&E Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents and
negotiations that had occurred with H&E to date. The Special Committee, in consultation with the Special Committee's advisors, discussed
the terms and conditions of the H&E Merger Agreement, the transactions contemplated by the H&E Merger Agreement, and other matters
relating to the transaction. Representatives of Deutsche Bank discussed with the Special Committee the financial aspects of the
transaction. The Special Committee discussed the terms and conditions of the H&E Merger Agreement, including, among other items, the
adjustment amount to the purchase price and the antitrust covenants. The Special Committee asked representatives of Deutsche Bank
numerous questions regarding the adjustment to the per share price for any incremental costs incurred in connection with extending H&E's
financing commitment. Richards Layton and the Special Committee discussed a proposed amendment to the Company's bylaws to add a
forum selection provision.

        At the meeting, Deutsche Bank presented its financial analysis and rendered its oral opinion to the Special Committee, which opinion
was subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of that date, based upon and subject to the assumptions made, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Deutsche Bank, as set forth in its written opinion, the merger
consideration ($21.07 in cash per share of Class A Common Stock to be received by the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock,
subject to downward adjustment to be no less than $20.63 per share pursuant to the H&E Merger Agreement) was fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of

Class A Common Stock (other than H&E, the Key Holders and their affiliates and executive officers of the Company).

        After careful consideration, the Special Committee unanimously (a) determined that it is in the best interests of Company and its
stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the H&E Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents, (b) recommended
that the Board approve the execution, delivery and performance of the H&E Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the H&E Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents, including the
Merger in accordance with the DGCL, and (c) recommended that the Board, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the H&E
Merger Agreement, recommend adoption of the H&E Merger Agreement by the stockholders of Company.

        Following such recommendation, the Board met to consider the transaction at $21.07 per share subject to downward adjustment to be
no less than $20.63 per share, receive an update on the status of negotiations with H&E by each of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump, and
consult with each of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump about the legal and financial aspects of the transaction. Akin Gump presented the
Board with a summary of the terms and conditions of the H&E Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents and negotiations
that had occurred with H&E to date. The Board, in consultation with the Company's advisors, discussed the terms and conditions of the
H&E Merger Agreement, the transactions contemplated by the H&E Merger Agreement, and other matters relating to the transaction.
Representatives of Deutsche Bank discussed with the Board the financial aspects of the transaction. The Board discussed the terms and
conditions of the H&E Merger Agreement, including, among other items, closing conditions, timing of the transaction and deal certainty.
After the Special Committee recommended the approval of the H&E Merger Agreement to the Board at the meeting, Deutsche Bank
presented its financial analysis and rendered its oral opinion to the Board, which opinion was subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of
that date, based upon and subject to the assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review
undertaken by Deutsche Bank, as set forth in its written opinion, the merger consideration ($21.07 in cash per share of Class A Common
Stock to be received by the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock, subject to downward adjustment to be no less than $20.63 per
share pursuant to the H&E Merger Agreement) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of Class A Common Stock (other
than H&E, the Key Holders and their affiliates and executive officers of the Company).

        The Board (a) determined that it is in the best interests of Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the
H&E Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents, (b) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the H&E Merger
Agreement and the other transaction documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the H&E Merger Agreement
and the other transaction documents, including the Merger in accordance with the DGCL, and (c) resolved, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the H&E Merger Agreement, to recommend adoption of the H&E Merger Agreement by the stockholders of
Company. The Board also discussed and approved an amendment to the Company's bylaws to add a forum selection provision.

        At the direction of the Board, the H&E Merger Agreement was executed on July 14, 2017, and the Company and H&E issued a joint
press release announcing their execution of the H&E Merger Agreement, such release noting that a thirty-seven (37) day go-shop period
was underway and would conclude at 11:59 P.M. on August 20, 2017.

        On July 14, 2017, concurrently with the execution of the H&E Merger Agreement, the Key Holders executed and delivered the
stockholder consent and the H&E Support Agreement to H&E and the H&E Exchange and Termination Agreements were executed and
delivered to H&E by the Key Holders and the other parties thereto.

Entry into the Merger Agreement with Parent

        After the announcement of the transaction and the commencement of the go-shop period, Deutsche Bank, at the direction of the
Special Committee, contacted twenty-four (24) market participants about pursuing a strategic transaction with the Company, including
nine (9) strategic and fifteen (15) financial buyers.

        After negotiations, the Company and URI entered into a confidentiality agreement on July 17, 2017. Subsequently, Deutsche Bank, at
the direction of the Special Committee, provided URI with confidential financial and business information that it had previously provided
to H&E. After negotiations, the Company and a strategic bidder ("Bidder A") entered into a confidentiality agreement on July 19, 2017.
Subsequently, Deutsche Bank, at the direction of the Special Committee, provided Bidder A with confidential financial and business
information that it had previously provided to H&E. The other parties contacted by Deutsche Bank did not express interest in a potential
transaction or a willingness to enter into a confidentiality agreement.

        From July 19 to August 15, 2017, URI conducted due diligence with respect to the Company, and the Company, with the assistance of
Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump, responded to various diligence requests and questions from URI.

        On August 2, 2017 a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump
present. Deutsche Bank, Akin Gump and the Special Committee discussed the status of the go-shop process.

        On August 8, URI conducted a due diligence call with Company management. Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump attended the call.

        On August 9, 2017, Bidder A informed Deutsche Bank that it was not interested in pursuing a transaction with the Company.

        On August 10, 2017, the Company received a proposal from URI to acquire all of the shares of the Company for $25.00 per share in
cash (the "URI Proposal"). In connection with the URI Proposal, URI also delivered to the Company a draft merger agreement by and
among the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, and drafts of the Exchange Agreements and Support Agreement. Besides the change in
Merger Consideration, a higher termination fee corresponding to the increased Merger Consideration, a longer outside date, removal of the
go-shop period and the removal of covenants related to committed debt financing, the terms of the Merger Agreement were substantially
the same as the H&E Merger Agreement. In accordance with the H&E Merger Agreement, representatives of the Akin Gump informed
H&E of the receipt of the URI Proposal and provided copies of the draft transaction documents.

        On August 11, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Deutsche Bank and Akin Gump
present. During this meeting, Akin Gump walked the Special Committee through the URI Proposal and the terms of the transaction
documents proposed by URI. Deutsche Bank and the Special Committee discussed Parent's ability to consummate the Merger using a
combination of cash and existing financing capacity. Akin Gump and the Special Committee also discussed regulatory matters related to
the transaction, including timing and execution risks as compared to the H&E transaction. After substantial discussion, the Special
Committee decided to seek further regulatory assurances from URI. Representatives of Akin Gump also discussed with the Special
Committee the requirements under the H&E Merger Agreement related to continued discussions between the Company and Parent.

        Following the conclusion of the August 11 telephonic meeting, representatives of Akin Gump delivered a revised draft of the Merger
Agreement to representatives of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP ("Sullivan"), Parent's legal advisor, which included enhanced regulatory
protections as compared to the regulatory protections in the H&E Merger Agreement.

        On August 12, 2017, Sullivan sent Akin Gump a further revised draft of the Merger Agreement and other transaction documents,
which revised the regulatory commitment set forth in the August 11 Akin Gump draft.

        On the morning of August 13, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Special Committee was held with representatives of Deutsche Bank
and Akin Gump present. Akin Gump and the Special Committee discussed the revised regulatory commitment extensively. Deutsche Bank
informed the Special Committee that, if requested, it would be in a position to deliver a fairness opinion with respect to the $25.00 per
share Merger Consideration proposed by Parent. Following this discussion, the Special Committee unanimously determined to recommend
the URI Proposal to the Board, subject to receipt of a fairness opinion from Deutsche Bank and acceptable regulatory assurances from
URI.

        After such meeting, Akin Gump and Sullivan negotiated the terms of the regulatory protections in the Merger Agreement. Parent
ultimately agreed to revise the relevant provision to reflect the terms described in "The Merger Agreement—Further Action; Efforts to
Complete the Merger", which revision was acceptable to the Special Committee.

        On the afternoon of August 13, 2017, a telephonic meeting of the Board was held with representatives of Deutsche Bank, Akin Gump
and Richards Layton present. Akin Gump described the revised Merger Agreement to the Board. After extensive discussion, the Board
unanimously determined that the URI Proposal constituted a Superior Proposal, as defined in the H&E Merger Agreement. Thereafter,
representatives of Sullivan and Akin Gump negotiated and finalized the terms of the Merger Agreement, and Parent delivered a signed
copy of the Merger Agreement and other transaction documents into escrow subject to the receipt by the Board of a fairness opinion from
Deutsche Bank and pending the completion of the five business day match period to which H&E was entitled under the H&E Merger
Agreement.

        In accordance with the H&E Merger Agreement, on the evening of August 13, 2017, representatives of Akin Gump notified H&E of
the Board's determination and its intent to terminate the H&E Merger Agreement after the expiration of the five business day match period
during which H&E had the right under the terms of the H&E Merger Agreement to adjust the terms of the H&E Merger Agreement such
that, in the determination of the Board, the URI Proposal no longer constituted a Superior Proposal. Akin Gump also provided Dechert
with copies of the final material transaction documents.

        On the morning of August 14, 2017, the Company issued a press release announcing the Board's determination that it had received a
Superior Proposal, and the Company's intention to terminate the H&E Merger Agreement following the five business day match period,
subject to the terms of the H&E Merger Agreement.

        On August 14, 2017, H&E filed a current report on Form 8-K stating that it was considering its position with respect to the Superior
Proposal and its matching right.

        On August 15, 2017 Dechert notified Akin Gump that H&E did not intend to submit a revised proposal and was willing to terminate
its matching right period early. That afternoon and subsequent to that discussion, Dechert delivered formal notice of such intention to the
Company.

        On the morning of August 16, 2017, H&E issued a press release stating its intention not to submit a revised proposal.

        On the evening of August 16, 2017, a meeting of the Board (including the Special Committee) was held with representatives of
Deutsche Bank, Akin Gump and Richards Layton present to consider the transaction. Akin Gump presented the participants with a
summary of the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents and negotiations that had occurred
with Parent to date. The Board, in consultation with the Company's advisors, discussed the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement,
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and

other matters relating to the transaction, including that the Special Committee had already recommended the Merger Agreement to the
Board. Representatives of Deutsche Bank discussed with the Board the financial aspects of the transaction. The Board discussed the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including, among other items, the regulatory matters and deal certainty. Deutsche Bank
presented its financial analysis and rendered its oral opinion, which opinion was subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of that date,
based upon and subject to the assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken
by Deutsche Bank, as set forth in its written opinion, the Merger Consideration ($25.00 in cash, without interest for each share of Class A
Common Stock owned by Company stockholders immediately prior to the Effective Time) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders of Class A Common Stock (other than Parent and its affiliates and executive officers of the Company).

        The Board (a) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into
the Merger Agreement and the other transaction documents, (b) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger
Agreement and the other transaction documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the
other transaction documents, including the Merger in accordance with the DGCL, and (c) resolved, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement, to recommend adoption of the Merger Agreement by the stockholders of Company.

        On August 16, 2017, Deutsche Bank sent a Disclosure Letter to Akin Gump providing updated revenues received, trading positions
and loan exposure for the Company, Parent, H&E and Wayzata.

        On August 16, 2017, URI paid the termination fee of $13,165,000 required under the H&E Merger Agreement to H&E on behalf of
the Company.

        On the evening of August 16, 2017, representatives of Akin Gump provided written notice to H&E that it was terminating the H&E
Merger Agreement, in accordance with its terms, in order to enter into the Merger Agreement with Parent. Thereafter, the Company
executed the Merger Agreement and Parent's signature pages were automatically released from escrow. Thereafter, the Company and URI
issued a joint press release announcing the transaction.

        On August 16, 2017, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Key Holders executed and delivered the
Stockholder Consent and the Support Agreement to Parent and the Exchange and Termination Agreements were executed and delivered to
Parent by the Key Holders and the other parties thereto.

The Company's Reasons for the Merger

        As described above in "Background of the Merger," (i) at a meeting held on August 13, 2017, the Special Committee (subject to final
resolution of certain terms), after consultation with its financial advisor and legal advisor, unanimously recommended that the Board and
(ii) the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee and after consultation with the Special Committee's financial
and legal advisor, determined that the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement constituted a Superior Proposal
as compared to the transactions contemplated by the H&E Merger Agreement, that the H&E Merger Agreement should be terminated and
that it was advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to enter into the Merger Agreement. In the course of
reaching the decision and making the recommendation described above, the Special Committee and the Board consulted with its outside
legal and financial advisors and with the Company's management and considered a number of factors that it believed supported its
decision, including the following:

• Attractive Value  The Special Committee and the Board considered the value of the Merger Consideration of $25.00 per
share in cash relative to the historical trading prices of the Class A Common Stock and relative to historical market trading

including that the Merger Consideration of $25.00 per share represented a premium to the closing price of the Class A
Common Stock on the last trading day prior to the date the Board approved the Merger Agreement, to the volume-weighted
average closing prices of the Class A Common Stock for the 4-week (9.7%), 3-month (17.7%), 6-months (22.9%) and 12-
month periods prior to such date (34.9%) and since the Company's initial public offering (97.0%).

• Premium Over H&E Transaction Value.  The fact that the Merger Consideration of $25.00 per share to be received by the
Company's stockholders in the merger represented a significant premium over the value of the consideration contemplated
by the H&E Merger Agreement, including a premium of approximately 18.7% over $21.07, which was the value of the
merger consideration contemplated by the H&E Merger Agreement (assuming a closing prior to January 15, 2018). 

• Best Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value.  The Special Committee and the Board considered that receipt of the
Merger Consideration of $25.00 per share in was more favorable to the Company's stockholders than the potential value
that might result from the Company's other strategic alternatives (including the alternative of remaining a stand-alone
public company and the transactions contemplated by the H&E Merger Agreement), particularly on a risk-adjusted basis.
This consideration was based on, among other things, the Special Committee's assessment of: 

• the Company's historical operating and financial performance, its competitive position and its future prospects; 

• the risks associated with the Company's strategy and execution plans, including risks to the Company's plans
associated with economic conditions generally and conditions in the industry in which the Company participates, as
well as the other risks and uncertainties discussed in the Company's public filings with the SEC; 

• the strategic and other alternatives reasonably available to the Company, including the alternative of remaining a
stand-alone public company, in light of a number of factors, including the risks and uncertainties associated with
those alternatives; 

• the fact that during the five business day match period that H&E was afforded under the H&E Merger Agreement
(until waived by H&E), H&E declined to propose adjustments to the terms and conditions of the H&E Merger
Agreement; and 

• the fact that only URI and one other potential bidder expressed an interest in pursuing a transaction with the
Company during the Go-Shop Period under the H&E Merger Agreement and that the other potential bidder had
withdrawn from the process. 

• Greater Certainty of Value.  The Special Committee and the Board considered that the proposed Merger Consideration is to
be paid entirely in cash, which provides the Company's stockholders with certainty of value for their shares. The Special
Committee also considered the likelihood that the closing of the Merger can occur promptly. 

• Likelihood of Consummation.  The Special Committee and the Board considered the degree of certainty that the closing
will be achieved, particularly in view of the terms of the Merger Agreement and related documents and the closing
conditions, which are limited in scope and number. In that regard, the Special Committee noted: 

• Parent's financial capacity to complete acquisitions; 

• Parent's management's understanding of the Company business and their collective experience with businesses of a
similar nature to the Company;

• that Parent's obligation to complete the Merger is not subject to receipt of financing or to any other financing-
related condition; 

• that Parent committed in the Merger Agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be
completed, including taking certain actions as may be required to obtain governmental and third party consents and
resolving any objections to the Merger, subject to agreed-upon limitations; and 

• that the Merger Agreement and the Support Agreement contemplated the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the
Key Holders by written consent and no additional vote of the Company's stockholders would be required to
consummate the Merger. 

• Opinion of the Company's Financial Advisor.  The Special Committee and the Board considered the opinion, dated
August 16, 2017, of Deutsche Bank as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of
the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Class A Common Stock (other than Parent and its affiliates and
executive officers of the Company), which opinion was based upon and subject to the factors, assumptions and limitations
therein, as more fully described in "The Merger—Opinion of the Company's Financial Advisor" beginning on page 41. 

• Support of the Key Holders.  The Special Committee and the Board considered that the Key Holders, which in the
aggregate hold approximately 62.7% of the outstanding Class B Common Stock, are supportive of the transaction. In this
regard, the Special Committee noted that the Key Holders would receive the same per share consideration for their shares
of Class A Common Stock (after giving effect to the Exchanges) as will be received by all the other Company stockholders
and that all of the Company's stockholders would share equally in the control premium being paid by Parent even though
the Key Holders may have been in a position to demand a disproportionate share of the control premium and/or payment
for agreeing to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement. 

• Other Terms of the Transaction.  The Special Committee and the Board considered the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement and related transaction documents, including: 

• the limited number and nature of the conditions to Parent's obligation to consummate the Merger and the absence of
any financing-related closing condition; 

• the fact that under specified circumstances, the Merger Agreement permits the Company to seek specific
performance against Parent and Merger Sub; 

• the determination that the termination fee of $21,960,000, representing approximately 3.5% of the equity value of
the Merger, is reasonable under the circumstances; 

• the availability of appraisal rights to the Company's stockholders who properly exercise their statutory rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL (see "Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 83); and 

• the fact that the Support Agreement entered into by the Key Holders terminates upon any termination of the Merger
Agreement.

        The Special Committee and the Board also considered a variety of potential risks and other potentially negative factors relating to the
transaction, including the following, but concluded that the anticipated benefits of the transaction substantially outweigh these
considerations:

• that the Company's stockholders (other than those with unvested Company Equity Awards who will receive Substitute
Stock Options and/or Substitute RSU Awards in URI) will have no ongoing equity participation in the Company or in
Parent following the Merger, and that such stockholders will cease to participate in the surviving company's future earnings
or growth, if

any, or to benefit from increases, if any, in the value of equity in the surviving company or Parent;

• the risk of incurring substantial expenses related to the Merger, including in connection with any litigation that may result
from the announcement or pendency of the Merger; 

• the fact that the Company would not be able to engage in discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal or
terminate the Merger Agreement to pursue an alternative sale or business combination transaction; 

• the risk that one or more conditions to the parties' obligations to complete the Merger will not be satisfied and the related
risk that the Merger may not be completed, including as a result of a failure by Parent to obtain regulatory clearance; 

• the risk that the Merger Agreement's restrictions on the conduct of the Company's business prior to the consummation of
the Merger, generally requiring the Company to conduct its business only in the ordinary course, subject to specific
limitations, may delay or prevent the Company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise pending
consummation of the Merger; 

• the risks and costs to the Company if the Merger does not close, including the diversion of management and employee
attention, potential employee attrition and the potential effect on business and customer relationships; 

• that the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of the Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes; 

• the possibility that the Company may be required to pay Parent a termination fee, the amount of which, if and when
payable, would be either $21,960,000; and 

• that, pursuant to the Support Agreement, the Key Holders, which in the aggregate hold approximately 62.7% of the Class B
Common Stock, would be obligated to deliver the Stockholder Consent concurrently with the execution of the Merger
Agreement and that the Stockholder Consent would be effective concurrently with execution of the Merger Agreement.

        In addition, each of the Special Committee and the Board believes that it was aware of and considered the interests that the Company
directors and named executive officers may have with respect to the transaction that differ from, or are in addition to, their interests as
stockholders of the Company generally, as described in "The Merger—Interests of Certain of the Company's Directors and Named
Executive Officers in the Merger."

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Special Committee and the Board is not intended to be
exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by each of the Special Committee and the Board in reaching its determination and
recommendation. In view of the variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger, the Special Committee and
the Board did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in
reaching its determination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The
Special Committee and the Board recommended the Merger Agreement and the Merger based upon the totality of the information it
considered.

        After considering these factors, the Special Committee and the Board concluded that the positive factors relating to the Merger
Agreement and the Merger outweighed the potential negative factors and declared the advisability of the Merger Agreement and the
Merger based upon the totality of the information presented to and considered by it.

        THE BOARD, ACTING UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE, APPROVED AND
DECLARED ADVISABLE THE MERGER AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER AND RECOMMENDED THAT OUR
STOCKHOLDERS ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

Opinion of the Company's Financial Advisor

        At the August 16, 2017 meeting of the Board, Deutsche Bank delivered its oral opinion to the Board, subsequently confirmed in a
written opinion dated August 16, 2017, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Deutsche Bank in preparing its opinion, the Merger
Consideration to be received by holders of Class A Common Stock, other than Parent and its affiliates and executive officers of the
Company, was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        The full text of Deutsche Bank's written opinion, dated August 16, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Deutsche Bank in connection with
the opinion, is included in this information statement as Annex E and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of
Deutsche Bank's opinion set forth in this information statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the
opinion. Deutsche Bank's opinion was addressed to, and for the use and benefit of, the Board of Directors of the Company in
connection with the approval of the Merger Agreement. Deutsche Bank expressed no opinion, and its opinion does not constitute a
recommendation, as to how any holder of Class A Common Stock should have voted with respect to the Merger. Deutsche Bank's
opinion was limited to the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Class A Common
Stock, other than Parent and its affiliates and executive officers of the Company, as of the date of the opinion. Deutsche Bank's
opinion did not address any other terms of the Merger or the Merger Agreement. Deutsche Bank was not asked to, and Deutsche
Bank's opinion did not, address the fairness of the Merger, or any consideration received in connection therewith, to Parent and its
affiliates and executive officers of the Company or to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies
of the Company's, nor did it address the fairness of the contemplated benefits of the Merger. Deutsche Bank expressed no opinion
as to the merits of the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Merger or the relative merits of the Merger as
compared to any alternative transactions or business strategies. Also, Deutsche Bank did not express any view or opinion as to the
fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or to be received by any of the Company's
officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, in connection with the Merger relative to the Merger consideration
to be received by holders of Class A Common Stock or otherwise.

        In connection with its role as financial advisor to the Special Committee, and in arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Bank reviewed
certain publicly available financial and other information concerning the Company and certain internal analyses, financial forecasts and
other information relating to the Company prepared by the management of the Company. Deutsche Bank also held discussions with certain
senior officers and other representatives and advisors of the Company regarding the Company's businesses and prospects. In addition,
Deutsche Bank:

• reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Class A Common Stock;

• compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with, to the extent publicly available, similar
information for Parent and three other companies it considered relevant whose securities are publicly traded; 

• reviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of nine business combinations which it deemed relevant; 

• reviewed the Merger Agreement, dated August 16, 2017 and certain related documents including the Tax Receivable
Agreement, dated as of November 26, 2014 (as amended, the "Tax Receivable Agreement"), by and among the Company,
Wayzata Opportunities Fund II, L.P. ("Opportunities Fund"), Wayzata Opportunities Fund Offshore II, L.P. ("Opportunities
Fund Offshore"), the Management Representative (as defined therein) and the LLC Optionholders (as defined therein), the
Exchange and Termination Agreement dated August 16, 2017 by and among the Company, Parent, Opportunities Fund, and
Opportunities Fund Offshore, the Exchange and Termination Agreement dated August 16, 2017 by and among the
Company, Parent, the Management Representative (as defined therein) and the LLC Optionholders (as defined therein), and
the Support Agreement dated August 16, 2017 by and among Parent, Opportunities Fund and Opportunities Fund Offshore
(collectively, the "Ancillary Agreements"); and 

• performed such other studies and analyses and considered such other factors as it deemed appropriate.

        Deutsche Bank did not assume responsibility for independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any information,
whether publicly available or furnished to it, concerning the Company, including, without limitation, any financial information considered
in connection with the rendering of its opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of its opinion, Deutsche Bank, with the knowledge and
permission of the Board, assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information. Deutsche Bank did not conduct
a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and did not prepare, obtain or review any independent evaluation or appraisal of
any of the assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or off-balance-sheet assets or liabilities), of the Company or Parent or
any of their respective subsidiaries, nor did Deutsche Bank evaluate the Company's solvency or fair value under any law relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters.

        Deutsche Bank was not requested to, and Deutsche Bank did not, solicit third party indications of interest in the possible acquisition
of all or part of the Company, nor was Deutsche Bank requested to consider, and Deutsche Bank's opinion does not address, the relative
merits of the Transaction as compared to any alternative transactions or business strategies.

        With respect to the financial forecasts made available to Deutsche Bank and used in its analyses, Deutsche Bank assumed at the
Board's direction that such forecasts had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments
of the management of the Company as to the matters covered thereby. In rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank expressed no view as to the
reasonableness of such forecasts and projections or the assumptions on which they are based. Deutsche Bank's opinion was necessarily
based upon economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion.
Deutsche Bank expressly disclaimed any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting its
opinion of which it becomes aware after the date of its opinion.

        For purposes of rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank assumed, with the knowledge and permission of the Board, that in all respects
material to its analysis, the Merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, without any waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement that would be material to its analysis.
Deutsche Bank also assumed, with the knowledge and permission of the Board, that all

material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required in connection with the consummation of the Merger would be
obtained and that in connection with obtaining any necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents, no restrictions,
terms or conditions would be imposed that would be material to its analysis. Deutsche Bank is not a legal, regulatory, tax or accounting
expert and Deutsche Bank relied on the assessments made by the Company and its other advisors with respect to such issues.

Summary of Material Financial Analyses of Deutsche Bank

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Deutsche Bank to the Board at its meeting held on
August 16, 2017, and that were used in connection with rendering its opinion described above. In accordance with customary investment
banking practice, Deutsche Bank employed generally accepted valuation methods in reaching its opinion. The following summary does
not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Deutsche Bank, nor does the order in which the analyses
are described represent the relative importance or weight given to the analyses by Deutsche Bank. Some of the summaries of the financial
analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone and, in order to fully understand the
financial analyses used by Deutsche Bank, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set
forth in the tables without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions
underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Deutsche Bank's financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted,
all quantitative information, to the extent it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before August 16, 2017.

        In connection with its analyses, as directed by the Board, Deutsche Bank considered financial projections prepared by Company
management. For more information about the financial projections, see "Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information Concerning
the Company" included elsewhere in this information statement. In connection with its analyses, Deutsche Bank assumed, at the Board's
direction, that such forecasts had been reasonably prepared and reflected the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of the Company as to the matters covered thereby.

Analysis of Public Trading Comparables

        Deutsche Bank performed a public trading comparables analysis, which derives an implied value of a company by comparing it to
similar companies that are publicly traded. Deutsche Bank compared certain of the Company's financial information with publicly
available information as of the latest quarterly ending for four companies operating general equipment rental services businesses: Parent,
Ashtead Group plc, Herc Holdings, Inc. and H&E Equipment Services, Inc. This analysis included a deduction for the present value of
projected payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, as provided by Company management, which were discounted at an estimated
cost of equity of 15%.

        No company utilized in the public trading comparables analysis is identical to the Company. For the purpose of choosing the
companies to derive the valuation multiples for this analysis, Deutsche Bank utilized its professional judgment and experience as
investment bankers, taking into account several factors, including, among other things, the Company's operational capabilities and
financial profile compared with those of the selected companies, the competitive landscape in which the Company and the selected
companies operate and the Company's product offerings and those of the selected companies. As a result, the analysis of publicly traded
comparable companies was not simply mathematical. Rather, it involved complex considerations and qualitative judgments concerning
differences in financial and operating characteristics of the selected companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value
of such companies.

        Based on the closing prices of Class A Common Stock and the common stock of the selected companies on August 15, 2017, balance
sheet as of the latest publicly-filed information of the selected companies and analyst consensus forecasts for the selected companies,
Deutsche Bank calculated (a) market capitalization, (b) net debt as a multiple of the last twelve months ("LTM") estimated earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") (c) adjusted EBITDA growth across 2016 and 2017 (expected), (d) the
enterprise value (defined as fully diluted equity value (utilizing the treasury stock method for outstanding options) plus total debt, capital
lease obligations and non-controlling interests, less cash and cash equivalents ("TEV")) as a multiple of 2017 adjusted EBITDA (expected)
as of August 15, 2017, (e) TEV as a multiple of 2017 adjusted EBITDA (expected) as of the date of the last U.S. election.

        The results of this analysis are summarized as follows:

        Based upon the foregoing and its professional judgment and experience, Deutsche Bank applied multiples ranging from 5.0x to 6.5x
to estimates of the Company's adjusted EBITDA (expected) for fiscal year 2017 ($207 million) provided by Company management in
order to calculate a range of estimated implied values per share of Class A Common Stock. This analysis resulted in a range of implied
share prices for the Company's Class A Common Stock of $13.50 to $25.50, which reflect a rounding to the nearest $0.25, compared to the
Merger Consideration of $25.00 per share.

Analysis of Precedent Transaction Comparables

        Deutsche Bank performed a precedent transactions analysis, which derives an implied value of a company by comparing it to select
acquisition transactions ("Transaction Comparables"), by reviewing publicly available information. This analysis included a deduction for
the present value of projected payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, as provided by Company management, which assumed no
midyear convention and were discounted at an estimated cost of equity of 15%. The nine Transaction Comparables reviewed were:

Table of Contents

        For each of the Transaction Comparables, Deutsche Bank calculated, based on company filings and press releases, the multiple of
such company's TEV to LTM EBITDA based upon the most recent historical twelve-month period (at the time of announcement of such
transaction) for which EBITDA is publicly disclosed.

        The results of this analysis are summarized as follows:

        Based on the results of this analysis and other factors that it considered appropriate, Deutsche Bank selected a range of valuation
multiples from 5.0x to 6.5x to apply to the Company's LTM EBITDA at June 30, 2017 ($198 million). This analysis resulted in a range of
implied value per share of Class A Common Stock of $11.50 to $23.25, which reflect a rounding to the nearest $0.25, compared to the
Merger Consideration of $25.00 per share.

Discounted Cash Flow Analyses

        Deutsche Bank calculated a range of equity values per share of Class A Common Stock based on a discounted cash flow analysis to
value the Company as of June 30, 2017.

        Deutsche Bank calculated the total enterprise value for the Company as the sum of the net present value of (i) the projected unlevered
free cash flows of the Company for fiscal years 2017 (second half only) through 2021 (expected), plus (ii) the value of the Company at the
end of such period (the "Terminal Value"). For purposes of its analyses, Deutsche Bank defined unlevered free cash flows as tax adjusted
earnings before interest and taxes, plus depreciation and amortization, less capital expenditures, and less or plus changes in net working
capital. Additionally, for purposes of its analyses, Deutsche Bank considered the Company's statutory tax rate to be 37.5%. The discounted
cash flow analysis reflects a positive adjustment for the present value of net operating losses (valued at $19 million after being discounted
at an estimated cost of equity of 15%) and a negative adjustment for the present value of projected payments under the Tax Receivable
Agreement (valued at $16 million after being discounted at an estimated cost of equity of 15%).

        The Company's Terminal Value was calculated using perpetuity growth rates from 1.75% to 2.25%. The Company's future cash flows
and Terminal Value were discounted to present values as of June 30, 2017 at discount rates ranging from 9.00% to 10.00%. These discount
rates were based on an analysis of the Company's weighted average cost of capital (the "WACC"), which was derived using (i) the risk free
rate, the equity risk premium and the Company's normalized unlevered beta, levered beta, and size premium to calculate the Company's
cost of equity, (ii) the Company's pre-tax cost of debt and tax rate to determine the Company's after-tax cost of debt and (iii) the
Company's normalized capital structure (based upon a Deutsche Bank estimate of the capital structure the Company would require to

        Deutsche Bank's discounted cash flow analyses yielded a range of implied value per share of Class A Common Stock of $15.75 to
$24.00, which reflect a rounding to the nearest $0.25, compared to the Merger Consideration of $25.00 per share.

Trading Range Analysis

        Deutsche Bank performed a trading range analysis with respect to the historical share prices of Class A Common Stock. Deutsche
Bank noted that the low and high closing trading prices per share of Class A Common Stock during the 52-week period ending on
August 15, 2017 were $8.44 and $26.15. As of August 15, 2017, the closing price per share of Class A Common Stock was $26.15,
compared to the Merger Consideration of $25.00 per share.

        Deutsche Bank's review of the trading range was for reference only.

Analyst Price Targets

        Deutsche Bank reviewed and analyzed future public market trading price targets for Class A Common Stock based upon research
reports prepared and published by four equity research analysts (published prior to July 13) and which reports Deutsche Bank has access
to. Each of the considered equity research analyst reports included a share price target for Class A Common Stock. The analyst price
targets for Class A Common Stock were $17.50 (report dated as of June 5, 2017), $20.00 (report dated as of May 1, 2017), $20.00 (report
dated as of April 27, 2017) and $24.00 per share (report dated as of April 26, 2017), compared to the Merger Consideration of $25.00 per
share. When discounted at an estimated cost of equity of 15%, the analyst price targets ranged from $15.25 to $20.75, which reflect a
rounding to the nearest $0.25, compared to the Merger Consideration of $25.00 per share.

        The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices
for Class A Common Stock and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the Company's future financial performance and
future financial market conditions.

        Deutsche Bank's review of analyst price targets was for reference only.

General

        The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data
presented by Deutsche Bank. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Deutsche Bank believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and
that selecting portions of the foregoing summary and these analyses, without considering all of the analyses as a whole, could create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses and the opinions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any
particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to create points of reference for analytical purposes
and should not be taken to be the view of either Deutsche Bank with respect to the Company's actual value. In arriving at its opinion,
Deutsche Bank reviewed various financial and operational metrics for the Company, including forecasts with respect to the Company,
which were made available to Deutsche Bank by the Company or on the Company's behalf.

        In arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Bank did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it, except as
noted above, and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor, considered in isolation, supported or failed to
support its opinion. Rather, Deutsche Bank considered the totality of the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the
control of the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by Deutsche Bank are not necessarily indicative
of actual future results,

which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, Deutsche Bank's analyses are not and do
not purport to be appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses could actually be bought or sold. The analyses
necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the
companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared to the Company.

        The Merger Consideration of $25.00 per share, was determined through arm's-length negotiations between the Company and Parent
and was approved by the Board. Deutsche Bank did not recommend any specific consideration to the Company or the Board or that any
specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.

        The Company, at the direction of the Special Committee, entered into an engagement letter with Deutsche Bank, dated April 5, 2017
and amended as of August 13, 2017, engaging Deutsche Bank on an exclusive basis to provide advisory and investment banking services
with respect to the exploration of interest in the acquisition of the Company. Deutsche Bank was selected by the Special Committee based
on Deutsche Bank's qualifications, expertise, reputation and experience in mergers and acquisitions and the Company's industry. Deutsche
Bank is an internationally recognized investment banking firm experienced in providing advice in connection with mergers and
acquisitions and related transactions.

        For financial advisory services rendered in connection with the Merger (including the delivery of its opinion), the Company has
agreed to pay Deutsche Bank a fee of approximately $13,000,000, $2,250,000 of which was payable upon delivery by Deutsche Bank of
its opinions, and the remainder of which will become due upon the closing of the Merger. The Company has also agreed to reimburse
Deutsche Bank for certain of its expenses, and to indemnify Deutsche Bank against certain liabilities, in connection with its engagement.

        During the two years preceding the date of Deutsche Bank's opinion, Deutsche Bank or its affiliates have provided services for which
they have received investment banking (including Parent's July 31, 2017 bond offering, for which an affiliate of Deutsche Bank served as
joint bookrunner), commercial banking (including extension of credit) and other financial service fees or revenue from Parent.
Additionally, an affiliate of Deutsche Bank is serving as joint bookrunner for Parent's September 2017 bond offering, which participation
the Board consented to after due consideration.

        Since January 1, 2015, the aggregate mergers and acquisitions financial advisory fees and other investment banking revenue received
or receivable by Deutsche Bank or its affiliates from Parent were approximately €2,500,000. As of August 11, 2017, Deutsche Bank or its
affiliates held equity trading positions of 2.86% of the Company and less than 1% of Parent.

        Deutsche Bank or its affiliates may also provide investment and commercial banking services to Parent, the Company and their
affiliates in the future, for which Deutsche Bank would expect to receive, or would expect its affiliates to receive, compensation. In the
ordinary course of business, Deutsche Bank or its affiliates may actively trade in the securities and other instruments and obligations of
Parent, the Company and their respective affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. Accordingly, Deutsche
Bank or its affiliates may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, instruments and obligations.

Financing

        The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to complete the Merger are not subject to any financing condition. Parent is funding the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement using a combination of cash, existing capacity under its ABL
facility and newly issued debt.

Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information Concerning the Company

        The Company does not, as a matter of general practice, publicly disclose financial projections, due to the unpredictability of the
underlying assumptions and estimates inherent in preparing financial projections. However, the Company has elected to provide the
unaudited prospective financial information set forth below in order to provide its stockholders access to selected non-public unaudited
prospective financial information that was prepared in connection with the evaluation of a possible transaction and was provided to the
Special Committee, its financial advisors and the Board prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement. These financial projections were
also provided to Parent and Centerview Partners LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. during the due diligence process. The financial
projections were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best then-currently available estimates and judgments of the management of
the Company as to the matters covered thereby. You should note that the prospective financial information constitutes forward-looking
statements, and that the prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure. Inclusion of this
information should not be regarded as an indication that any of the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates, officers,
employees, directors, advisors or other representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be
necessarily predictive of actual future results or is indicative of guidance that the Company would provide as a stand-alone company
should the transaction not be consummated. No person has made or makes any representation to any stockholder or other person regarding
the Company's ultimate performance compared to the prospective financial information or that forecasted results will be achieved. The
Company has made no representation to Parent, in the Merger Agreement or otherwise, concerning these or any financial forecast. Readers
of this information statement are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the prospective financial information. See "Cautionary
Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" on page 17.

        The prospective financial information was prepared for internal use and is subjective in many respects. While presented with numeric
specificity, the prospective financial information reflects numerous estimates and assumptions of the Company's management with respect
to operating expense, capital expenditures, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, litigation, market and financial
conditions and matters specific to the Company's business, many of which are beyond the Company's control. As a result, there can be no
assurance that the financial results included prospective financial information will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly
higher or lower than estimated. Since the prospective financial information covers multiple years, such information by its nature becomes
less predictive with each successive year. A number of important factors with respect to the Company's business and the industry in which
it participates may affect actual results and result in the prospective financial information not being achieved. For a description of some of
these factors, the Company's stockholders are urged to review the Company's most recent SEC filings as well as "Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward-Looking Statements." Economic and business environments can and do change quickly which adds a significant
level of unpredictability and execution risk. These factors create significant uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the
prospective financial information will be achieved. The prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward complying
with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), the published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or the
use of non-GAAP financial measures or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for
preparation and presentation of the prospective financial information. Neither the Company's independent registered public accounting
firm, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective
financial information, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability.
Furthermore, the prospective financial information does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date of its
preparation and the Company does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to the prospective financial
information.

        "EBITDA" is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation of rental
equipment and other depreciation and amortization. "Adjusted EBITDA" is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to other
items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including for the periods presented such as rental split expense,
equity-based compensation, adjustment to tax receivable agreement and (gain) loss on interest rate swap. "EBIT" is defined as net income
(loss) plus interest expense and provision for (benefit from) income taxes. "Adjusted EBIT" is defined as EBIT further adjusted to give
effect to other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our ongoing operations, including for the periods presented such as rental

EBIT less provision for (benefit from) income taxes. "Unlevered Free Cash Flow" is defined as Tax Adjusted EBIT plus depreciation of
rental equipment and other depreciation and amortization less capital expenditures plus decrease (or less increase) in net working capital.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Tax Adjusted EBIT and Unlevered Free Cash Flow are not measures of performance
in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or operating cash flows determined in
accordance with GAAP. Additionally, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Tax Adjusted EBIT and Unlevered Free Cash
Flow are not intended to be measures of cash flow for management's discretionary use, as they exclude certain cash requirements such as
interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT, Adjusted
EBIT, Tax Adjusted EBIT and Unlevered Free Cash Flow is appropriate because securities analysts, investors and other interested parties
use these non-GAAP financial measures as important measures of assessing our operating performance across periods on a consistent
basis. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT, Adjusted EBIT, Tax Adjusted EBIT and Unlevered Free Cash Flow have

limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under
GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

• although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to
be replaced in the future and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; 

• they do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 

• they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

• they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal
payments on our significant amount of indebtedness; and 

• they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we do not consider to be indicative of our
ongoing operations but may nonetheless have a material impact on our results of operations.

        In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
EBIT may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in our industry.

Interests of Certain of the Company's Directors and Named Executive Officers in the Merger

        In considering the recommendation of the Board to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be aware that certain of the Company's
directors and named executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of the Company's
stockholders generally. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, (i) in evaluating the Merger
Agreement, (ii) in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement, and (iii) in recommending to Company stockholders that the
Merger Agreement and the Merger be approved and adopted. These interests include those described below.

Options becoming entitled to receive: 

• in the case of each unvested Company Stock Option, a Substitute Stock Option (a) to purchase a number of whole
shares of URI Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number

granted immediately prior to the Effective Time); and

• in the case of each vested Company Stock Option, Parent will cause the surviving corporation or one of its
subsidiaries to pay the holder thereof an amount of cash (less applicable tax withholdings) within ten (10) days after
the closing date equal to the product of (a) the Merger Consideration, minus the per share exercise price for the
Class A Common Stock issuable under such Company Stock Option (or portion thereof), multiplied by (b) the
number of shares of Class A Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) as of the
Effective Time.

Each holder of vested Company Stock Options will be entitled to exercise his or her vested Company Stock Options prior to the Effective
Time in accordance with the terms of the applicable governing documents, in which case such holder will be treated as a holder of Class A
Common Stock for purposes of the Merger Agreement.

Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards

        Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time of the Merger:

• each Company Restricted Stock Unit Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of the Effective Time will
be cancelled and will cease to be outstanding and will not be assumed by Parent, with the holder of such Company
Restricted Stock Unit Awards becoming entitled to receive: 

• in the case of each unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit Award, a Substitute RSU Award (which is time-vested)
relating to the number of URI Common Stock equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of Class A Common
Stock with respect to such Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards that were unvested as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (b) the Exchange Ratio (with each Substitute RSU Award generally being subject to the
same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, any time-based vesting schedule) as applied to the related
Company Restricted Stock Unit Award in respect of which such Substitute RSU Award was granted, provided that
any performance vesting condition will be waived); and 

• in the case of each vested Company Restricted Stock Unit Award, Parent will cause the surviving corporation or
one of its subsidiaries to pay the holder thereof an amount of cash (less applicable tax withholdings) within ten days
after the closing date equal to the product of (a) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (b) the number of shares
of Class A Common Stock with respect to which such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award was so vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

required by applicable law.

        On August 16, 2017, the Board approved and adopted the 2014 Plan Amendment providing additional protections in the event of
termination without "cause" (as defined in the 2014 Plan Amendment) or resignation for "good reason" (as defined in the 2014 Plan
Amendment) after the consummation of the Merger. The 2014 Plan Amendment will become effective immediately prior to the

        Under the 2014 Plan Amendment, in the event a holder of a Substitute RSU Award is terminated by the Company without "cause"
(and not due to death or disability) or as a result of the holder's resignation for "good reason" following the Merger, to the extent unvested
as of the date of such termination, (i) a pro-rata portion of such Substitute RSU Award will become vested on the date of such termination
and settled generally within sixty (60) days of termination and (ii) the remaining unvested Substitute RSU Award will become settled on
the date which the performance period for the Company Restricted Stock Unit Award related to the Substitute RSU Award was scheduled
to end, in the case of (ii) subject to the holder's compliance with restrictive covenants through the applicable vesting dates. In addition,
under the 2014 Plan Amendment, in the event a holder of a Substitute Stock Option is terminated by the Company without "cause" (and
not due to death or disability) or as a result of the holder's resignation for "good reason" following the Merger, to the extent unvested as of
the date of such termination, such Substitute Stock Option will remain outstanding and continue to vest in accordance with its regularly
scheduled dates, subject to the holder's compliance with applicable restrictive covenants through the applicable vesting dates. Following
any such vesting date, the Substitute Stock Option (or portion thereof) will be exercisable only for a limited period of time before it
expires.

Termination Benefits of Named Executive Officers

        Each of Mr. Hood, Irion and Parks is subject to an employment agreement or letter that does not provide for any enhanced severance
payments or benefits on his termination of employment in connection with a change of control of the Company. However, as described
below, each of Mr. Hood, Irion and Parks is entitled to receive severance payments and benefits under such agreement or letter if, at any
time, the Company or its affiliates terminates his employment without "cause" (as defined in the applicable agreement or letter) or he
resigns for "good reason" (as defined below).

        Pursuant to the employment agreement with Mr. Hood, upon a termination of Mr. Hood's employment by the Company and affiliates
without "cause" (other than by reason of death or disability) or by reason of his resignation for "good reason," Mr. Hood is entitled to
severance consisting of (a) two (2) times the sum of Mr. Hood's base salary and the highest annual bonus amount paid to Mr. Hood for any
of the three (3) calendar years preceding the year in which the termination occurs, payable in twenty-four (24) monthly installments,
which, as of August 16, 2017, would equal an aggregate amount of $1,899,604, (b) a pro-rata portion of the annual bonus for the year of
termination based on the number of days he was employed during the fiscal year and based on actual company performance, and (c) the
continuation of all Company-sponsored health and welfare benefits through the earlier of the second (2nd) anniversary of the termination
date and the date on which Mr. Hood violates any restrictive covenant set forth within his agreement.

        Pursuant to the employment agreement with Mr. Irion, upon a termination of Mr. Irion's employment by the Company and affiliates
without "cause" (other than by reason of death or disability) or by reason of his resignation for "good reason," Mr. Irion is entitled to
severance consisting of (a) the sum of (i) two (2) times Mr. Irion's base salary and (ii) two (2) times the highest annual bonus paid to
Mr. Irion during any of the three (3) fiscal years preceding the year in which the termination occurs, payable in twenty-four (24) monthly
installments, which, as of August 16, 2017, would equal an aggregate amount of $1,273,342, (b) a pro-rata portion of the annual bonus for
the year of termination based on the number of days he was employed during the fiscal year and based on actual company performance,
and (c) the continuation of all Company-sponsored health and welfare benefits for twenty-four (24) months following the date of
termination.

        Each of Mr. Hood and Mr. Irion's employment agreements contains a cutback provision pursuant to which, to the extent either of
Mr. Hood or Mr. Irion receives any payment or other benefit in connection with a change in control transaction that would subject him to
excise taxes imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, such payments will be reduced by such amount and in such

order provided for within his employment agreement in order to avoid excise taxes, such that he will receive either (i) the full amount of
all such payments or (ii) a portion of the payments having a value equal to $1 less than the amount that would trigger excise taxes,
whichever provides the greatest portion of payments on an after-tax basis.

        Pursuant to the employment letter with Mr. Parks, upon a termination by us without "cause" or resignation by Mr. Parks for "good
reason" pursuant to the Neff Rental LLC Executive Severance Policy, Mr. Parks is entitled to severance consisting of (a) continued base
salary for twenty-four (24) months, payable in twenty-four (24) monthly installments, which, as of August 16, 2017, would equal an
aggregate amount of $658,000 and (b) continued health benefits for the same twenty-four (24) month period. We have the option to reduce
Mr. Parks' severance package by the same amount by which we reduce the duration of Mr. Parks' non-compete period, should we choose
to do so, but by no more than 50% in either case.

        For purposes of Mr. Hood's agreement, "good reason" generally means the occurrence of any of the following events or conditions:
(i) the nature of Mr. Hood's duties or the scope of his responsibilities is materially modified by the Company and affiliates without his
written consent where such material modification constitutes his demotion or a substantial reduction in his responsibilities; (ii) a reduction
in his base salary or target annual bonus opportunity; (iii) any material breach by the Company and affiliates of any provision of his
employment agreement that has not been cured within thirty (30) days following receipt by the Company and affiliates of written notice of

employment agreement) (A) the purchaser does not assume the severance provisions in his employment agreement (including

business office to be at any office located more than twenty five (25) miles from the office where he is currently based without his consent;
or (vi) his failure to be nominated for election to the Board or to report directly to the Board or a reduction in his title without his consent.

        For purposes of Mr. Irion's agreement, "good reason" generally means the occurrence of the following events or conditions: (i) the

and affiliates without his consent where such material modification constitutes his demotion or a substantial reduction in his
responsibilities; (ii) the Company and affiliates requires his principal business office to be at any office located more than fifty (50) miles
from the office where he is currently based without his consent; (iii) a reduction in his base salary or a reduction in his target annual bonus

within thirty (30) days following receipt by the Company and affiliates of written notice of such breach from Mr. Irion specifically
identifying such material breach; (v) his employment agreement is not assumed by any successor of the Company and affiliates as
provided in the employment agreement in a situation other than a "change in control"; or (vi) for each of the following (1) through
(8) below, solely during the two (2) year period following a "change in control," (1) a change in his status, title, position or responsibilities

responsibilities as in effect immediately prior thereto; the assignment to him of any duties or responsibilities which, in his reasonable
judgment, are inconsistent with such status, title, position or responsibilities; or his removal or the failure to reappoint or re-elect him to
any such position, except in connection with the termination of his employment for disability, "cause," as a result of his death or by him
other than for "good reason," (2) a reduction in his base salary or any failure to pay him any compensation or benefits to which he is

average percentage increases granted to him during the three (3) most recent full years ended prior to a "change in control"; (4) the

reduction in his base salary; (ii) a material modification of his duties where such modification constitutes a demotion; or (iii) the

Sale Transaction Bonuses

        Neff Holdings LLC has a sale transaction bonus plan that entitles certain service providers, including each of the named executive
officers and certain of the non-employee directors, to receive cash payments upon the consummation of a "sale transaction" (which
includes a "change in control" of the Company), subject to the applicable executive or director's continued service with Neff
Holdings LLC or its subsidiaries (the "Company Group") on such "sale transaction." Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
named executive officer or applicable director's employment or service is terminated by the Company Group for any reason other than
"cause" (as defined in the plan) or due to death or total disability, then such executive or director (or his estate, as applicable) will remain
eligible to receive a payment under the plan, provided that the "sale transaction" is consummated within nine (9) months of such
termination other than for "cause" (or twelve (12) months of a termination due to death or total disability).

        In the event of a sale transaction, each of Mr. Hood, Mr. Irion, Mr. Parks, Mr. Continenza and Mr. Singer is entitled to receive a
payment of $2,606,522, $1,554,349, $717,391, $150,333 and $105,233, respectively, under this plan. The sale transaction bonuses will be
payable in a lump sum, depending on the terms of the specific award letter, either (i) on the thirtieth (30th) day following the
consummation of the "sale transaction" or (ii) on the closing date of the consummation of the sale transaction (or, if such payment is to be
made through the payroll system, on the first reasonably practicable day following such closing date on which such payment can be made
through the payroll system). The Merger will qualify as a sale transaction under the sale transaction bonus plan.

Neff Holdings 2014 Incentive Bonus Plan

        Pursuant to the Neff Holdings LLC 2014 Incentive Bonus Plan (the "2014 Plan"), certain service providers (including the named
executive officers and certain of the non-employee directors) were granted a contingent right to receive cash distribution awards in
connection with Wayzata Opportunities Fund II, L.P. and Wayzata Opportunities Fund Offshore II, L.P.'s (together, the "sponsor") receipt
of a specified level of proceeds in connection with the sale, disposition or transfer of its common units in Neff Holdings, LLC. The
proceeds received by the sponsor in connection with the Merger will exceed such specified level. In general, under this plan, once the
sponsor receives cash proceeds, dividends or

distributions (together, the "cash proceeds") of at least $81,000,000, Neff Rental LLC will fund an incentive pool of $2,100,000 and at
such time as the sponsor receives cash proceeds of at least $108,000,000, Neff Rental LLC will fund an additional incentive pool of
$2,100,000. The consummation of the Merger will cause the funding of both incentive pools. Each of Mr. Hood, Mr. Irion, Mr. Parks,
Mr. Continenza and Mr. Singer are eligible to receive 28.01%, 16.70%, 7.71%, 1.62% and 1.13% of the incentive pool, respectively, in a
single, lump sum payment within thirty (30) days of the applicable incentive pool establishment date, subject to continued employment or
service through the relevant date at which the incentive pool is established. In the event any award granted under the 2014 Plan is forfeited
as a result of a participant's termination of employment with (or service to) the Company or its affiliates, or otherwise, each remaining
participant in the 2014 Plan shall be entitled to an additional award equal to the percentage specified in the preceding sentence with respect
to such individual multiplied by the percentage applicable to forfeiting participant multiplied by the total incentive pool. Thus, each of
Mr. Hood, Mr. Irion, Mr. Parks, Mr. Continenza and Mr. Singer may receive a percentage of the incentive pools that is greater than the
percentages specified above.

Further Actions

        Parent and the Company have agreed that the Company may grant retention bonus awards to Company employees (including
executive officers) to incent retention. Awards would be payable in cash in connection with the closing of the Merger and/or service
following the closing of the Merger (but no earlier than July 14, 2018), subject to terms and conditions agreed upon by the Company and
Parent, as applicable. As of the date of this information statement, no determinations have been made as to any executive officer who will
receive awards or the amounts of such awards.

Indemnification, Expense Advancement, Exculpation and Insurance

        The Merger Agreement provides that, after the Effective Time and until the sixth anniversary of closing, Parent agrees to cause the
Company (as the surviving corporation) to indemnify and hold harmless each current and former director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or fiduciaries of the Company and its subsidiaries under any Company benefit plan against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising in whole or in part out of (i) the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or is or was a fiduciary of the Company or any of its subsidiaries under Company
benefit plans prior to the Effective Time and (ii) matters, acts, or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the documents referred therein, the transaction documents and this information statement and
the documents referred to herein to the same extent that such person is entitled to be indemnified as of the date of the Merger Agreement
under the Company's organizational documents and existing indemnification agreements. The Merger Agreement also provides that Parent
will cause the Company (as the surviving corporation) to advance expenses as incurred by any such indemnified party upon receipt of an
undertaking from such indemnified party to the same extent as such persons are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of the
Merger Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company's organizational documents and any indemnification agreements disclosed to
Parent.

        In addition, Parent will cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its subsidiaries (or a substitute with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts with
terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured in the aggregate) with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time for six years following the Effective Time. However, Parent will not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of
300% of the aggregate annual premium paid as of the date of the Merger Agreement by the Company for such insurance, but in such case
will purchase the maximum coverage available in the surviving corporation's good faith determination for such amount.

The Company may, in consultation with Parent, purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six (6) year prepaid "tail" policy providing
equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in
the aggregate, does not exceed 300% of the aggregate annual premium paid as of the date of the Merger Agreement by the Company for
such insurance. If such "tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent will no longer have any
further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance under the Merger Agreement.

Regulatory Waiting Periods

        Under the HSR Act, the Merger may not be completed until the Company and Parent have filed notification and report forms with the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and the applicable waiting period has expired
or been terminated. The Company and Parent each intend to file a Notification and Report Form with the Antitrust Division and the
Federal Trade Commission and request early termination of the waiting period.

        Under the Merger Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to obtain all required
governmental approvals and avoid any suit, action, proceeding brought by a governmental entity or investigation or injunctions or orders
therefrom, in each case, challenging the Merger Agreement or transactions contemplated thereby, including Parent and the Company's
agreement to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of assets; however, Parent is not required to agree to any sale or disposition of assets
or businesses that, individually or in the aggregate, constitute or contribute more than $25,000,000 of the consolidated revenues of the
Company and its subsidiaries, as estimated by the Company for the 2017 calendar year (provided, that the Company may not agree to any
such action without the approval of Parent and Parent will be entitled to determine the assets or businesses of Parent or the Company to be
sold, held separate or otherwise divested). Further, neither the Company nor Parent is required to pay or agree to pay any fee, penalty or
other consideration (other than the HSR Act filing fee), or modify any of its material contracts to obtain any consent, approval, clearance,
order, waiver or authorization in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Except as noted above with
respect to the required filings under the HSR Act, the expiration of 20 days from the mailing of this information statement to the
Company's stockholders and the filing of a certificate of merger (including the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the
surviving corporation to be attached thereto) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware at or before the effective time of the
Merger, we are unaware of any material federal, state or foreign regulatory requirements or approvals required for the execution of the
Merger Agreement or consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Merger Consideration

        Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, our stockholders will have the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, which is $25.00 in cash, without interest, less any deduction for withholding taxes required by
applicable law, for each share of Class A Common Stock that they own immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Merger
Consideration will not be paid in respect of (i) those shares of Class A Common Stock held by the Company in treasury, (ii) those shares
of Class A Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries and (iii) those shares
of Class A Common Stock to which appraisal rights have been properly perfected and not withdrawn or otherwise lost in accordance with

Delisting and Deregistration of Our Class A Common Stock

        If the Merger is completed, the Company's Class A Common Stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the
Exchange Act. After consummation of the Merger, the Company will no longer be required to file periodic reports with the SEC on
account of the Class A Common Stock or otherwise.

Directors and Officers; Certificates of Incorporation; Bylaws

        The parties to the Merger Agreement must take all necessary action to cause the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time to be the directors of the Company, as the surviving corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
surviving corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the officers of the surviving
corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation.

        At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company will be amended to be identical to the as agreed certificate of
incorporation at the time of the execution of the Merger Agreement, and, as so amended, will be the certificate of incorporation of the
surviving corporation. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the surviving corporation will be amended to read in their entirety as the
bylaws of Merger Sub immediately prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement (provided that the name of Merger Sub will be
replaced with the name of the surviving corporation).

Company Stock Options

        Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time of the Merger:

• each Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time will
be cancelled, will cease to be outstanding and will not be assumed by Parent with the holder of such Company Stock
Options becoming entitled to receive:

(i) the exercise price per share of Class A Common Stock applicable to the Company Stock Option (or portion
thereof) in respect of which such Substitute Stock Option was granted immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) the Exchange Ratio (with each Substitute Stock Option otherwise generally having, and being subject to, the
same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Company Stock Option in respect of which such Substitute
Stock Option was granted immediately prior to the Effective Time); and

• in the case of each vested Company Stock Option, Parent will cause the surviving corporation or one of its
subsidiaries to pay the holder thereof an amount of cash (less applicable tax withholdings) within ten days after the
closing date equal to the product of (a) the Merger Consideration, minus the per share exercise price for the Class A
Common Stock issuable under such Company Stock Option (or portion thereof), multiplied by (b) the number of
shares of Class A Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) as of the Effective
Time.

Each holder of vested Company Stock Options will be entitled to exercise his or her vested Company Stock Options prior to the Effective
Time in accordance with the terms of the applicable governing documents, in which case such holder will be treated as a holder of Class A
Common Stock for purposes of the Merger Agreement.

• each outstanding Company Restricted Stock Unit Award, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of the Effective
Time will be cancelled, will cease to be outstanding and will not be assumed by Parent, with the holder of such Company
Restricted Stock Unit Awards becoming entitled to receive: 

• in the case of each unvested Company Restricted Stock Unit Award, a Substitute RSU Award (which is time-vested)
relating to the number of URI Common Stock equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of Class A Common
Stock with respect to such Company Restricted Stock Unit Awards that were unvested as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (b) the Exchange Ratio (with each Substitute RSU Award generally being subject to the
same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, any time-based vesting schedule) as applied to the related
Company Restricted Stock Unit Award in respect of which such Substitute RSU Award was granted, provided that
any performance vesting condition will be waived); and 

• in the case of each vested Company Restricted Stock Unit Award, Parent will cause the surviving corporation or
one of its subsidiaries to pay the holder thereof an amount of cash (less applicable tax withholdings) within ten
(10) days after the closing date equal to the product of (a) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (b) the number
of shares of Class A Common Stock with respect to which such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award was so
vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        Payments incident to the cash out of equity awards will be made without interest and less any deduction for withholding taxes as
required by applicable law.

2014 Plan Amendment

        On August 16, 2017, the Board approved and adopted the 2014 Plan Amendment providing additional protections in the event of
termination without "cause" or resignation for "good reason" (each as defined in the 2014 Plan Amendment) after the consummation of the

Tax Deductions and Withholdings of Company Equity Awards

        Parent, the surviving corporation and their respective subsidiaries will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise
payable to the holders of the Company Equity Awards such amounts that Parent, the surviving corporation or their respective subsidiaries
are required to withhold from such holders pursuant to applicable tax laws and remit such withheld and deducted amounts to the applicable
government entity on behalf of the applicable holders of the Company Equity Awards. For all purposes of the Merger Agreement, such
withheld and deducted amounts remitted to any applicable government entity as required by applicable tax laws will be treated as having
been paid to the applicable holders of the Company Equity Awards.

Stockholders Seeking Appraisal

        The Merger Agreement provides that the shares of those stockholders who are entitled to demand and properly demand appraisal for
such shares will not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but will instead be entitled to such rights as are
granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. If a holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses his, her or its right to appraisal of shares of Common
Stock, or if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to appraisal rights, his, her or its shares will be
treated as if they had been converted into and are exchangeable for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement.
The Company must give Parent prompt notice of demands for appraisal or withdrawal of any such demand and the Company may not
voluntarily make, or commit or agree to make, any payment with respect to a demand for appraisal or settle any such demands without
Parent's prior written consent. The Company must give Parent the opportunity to participate in and control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands for appraisal.

        The fair value of shares of Common Stock as determined in accordance with Delaware law may be more or less than (or the same as)
the Merger Consideration to be paid to stockholders who choose not to exercise their appraisal rights. Stockholders who wish to exercise
appraisal rights must precisely follow specific procedures. Additional details on appraisal rights are described above in "Appraisal Rights."

Payment for the Shares

        Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to make payment of the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent will deposit with the paying
agent the funds appropriate to pay the Merger Consideration.

        As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten (10) calendar days after the Effective
Time, Parent must cause the paying agent to mail to each person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of
one or more certificates representing shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock or uncertificated shares of the Company's Class A
Common Stock represented by book-entry (other than any shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock owned by the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective direct or indirect subsidiaries, which will be automatically cancelled as of the Effective
Time), a letter of transmittal and instructions advising you how to surrender your certificates representing shares, or shares represented by
book-entry, of Class A Common Stock in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

        The paying agent will promptly pay you your Merger Consideration after you have (1) surrendered the certificate(s) representing your
shares of Class A Common Stock and provided to the paying agent a properly completed letter of transmittal and any other documents
reasonable required by the paying agent, or (2) if your shares of Class A Common Stock are held as book-entry shares, the paying agent

has received an "agent's message" or such other evidence of transfer as the paying agent may reasonably request. Interest will not be paid
or accrue in respect of cash payments. YOU SHOULD NOT SURRENDER YOUR SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK
WITHOUT A LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, AND YOU SHOULD NOT RETURN YOUR CERTIFICATES TO THE COMPANY AT
THIS TIME.

        After the Effective Time, we will close our stock transfer books and there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Company of the shares of the Company's Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        If any cash deposited with the paying agent remains undistributed to holders of certificates for one (1) year after the Effective Time,
such cash will be delivered to the surviving corporation. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not complied with the share
certificate exchange procedures in the Merger Agreement may thereafter only look to the surviving corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration, in each case, without interest thereon.

        If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered share
certificate or the transferred book-entry share, as applicable, is registered, the paying agent will promptly pay the Merger Consideration
after such person has (i) delivered a properly endorsed certificate that is otherwise in proper form for transfer or properly transferred such
book-entry share, and (ii) paid to the paying agent any transfer or other tax required as a result of such payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such certificate or book-entry share, as applicable, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the paying agent that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.

        The letter of transmittal will include instructions if the stockholder has lost the share certificate or if it has been stolen or destroyed.
The stockholder will have to provide an affidavit of that fact reasonably satisfactory to Parent and, if required by Parent, post a bond in
such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such share
certificate in order for the paying agent to deliver applicable Merger Consideration.

Representations and Warranties

        The Merger Agreement contains a number of representations and warranties made by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub. The
statements embodied in those representations and warranties were made for purposes of the contract among the parties and are subject to
qualifications and limitations agreed to by the parties in connection with negotiating the terms of that contract. Certain representations and
warranties were made as of the date of the Merger Agreement (or other dates specified in the Merger Agreement), may be subject to
contractual standards of materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders or may have been used for the purpose of
allocating risk by the parties rather than establishing matters of fact. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and
warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts because they are qualified as described above. Moreover, information concerning
the subject matter of the representations and warranties may have changed since the date of the Merger Agreement, and these changes may
or may not be fully reflected in the Company's or Parent's public disclosures. The Merger Agreement should not be read alone, but should
instead be read in conjunction with the other information regarding the Company, Parent and the Merger Sub that is contained in this
information statement, as well as in the filings that the Company and Parent will make and have made with the SEC. The representations
and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement may or may not have been accurate as of the date they were made and we make no
assertion herein that they are accurate as of the date of this information statement.

        In the Merger Agreement, the Company has made a number of representations and warranties that are subject, in some cases, to

Company Material Adverse Effect Definition

        Some of the Company's representations and warranties are qualified by a material adverse effect standard. For purposes of the Merger
Agreement, "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any event, circumstance, occurrence, fact, condition, development, effect or
change that (a) has a material adverse effect on the ability of Company to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement and to
consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or (b) would reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, be materially adverse to the business, properties, assets, results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of
the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any events, circumstances, occurrences, facts, conditions, developments, effects or
changes, alone or in combination, be deemed to constitute or be taken into account in determining whether there has been or may be a
Company Material Adverse Effect under clause (b) of the paragraph above to the extent arising out of, relating to or resulting from any of
the following, except, in certain instances, to the extent (and only to the extent) that any such event, circumstance, occurrence, fact,
condition, development, effect or change has a disproportionate adverse impact on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
relative to other similarly situated participants in the industry in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate:

• changes generally affecting the U.S. economy or U.S. political conditions, including the results of any primary or general
elections; 

• changes in general financial, debt, credit, capital or banking markets or conditions (including any disruption thereof) in the
United States; 

• changes in interest, currency or exchange rates or the price of any commodity, security or market index; 

• changes in legal or regulatory conditions, including changes or proposed changes in law, GAAP or other accounting
principles or requirements, or standards, interpretations or enforcement thereof or the failure of any such proposed,
discussed or contemplated changes to be implemented; 

• changes in the Company's and its subsidiaries' industry in general or customary seasonal fluctuations in the business of the
Company and its subsidiaries;

Adverse Effect has occurred);

Support Agreement and Stockholder Action by Written Consent

to which the Key Holders agreed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Support Agreement, to vote all their shares of
Common Stock (or execute and deliver a written consent with respect to such shares) in favor of (i) adoption of the Merger Agreement,
(ii) approval of the Merger and any other matters required to be approved or adopted in order to effect the Merger and (iii) the other
transactions contemplated hereby. The Support Agreement is further described in "The Support Agreement" beginning on page 77 of this
information statement.

        Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Key Holders also delivered the Stockholder Consent, adopting and
approving the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. Therefore, no further approval or consent
by the Company's stockholders is required or needed in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby.

Financing Cooperation

        Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, and will request their respective
representatives to, at Parent's sole cost and expense, use reasonable best efforts to provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent,
Merger Sub and their representatives in connection with arranging, marketing and consummating debt financing by Parent and Merger
Sub. Parent will, upon demand by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by the Company or any of its subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation, and Parent will indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its affiliates and their respective representatives from and against any and all damages suffered or incurred by them
in connection with the arrangement or marketing of the financing.

fee), or modify any of its material contracts to obtain any consent, approval, clearance, order, waiver or authorization in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Transaction Litigation 

        The Company will give Parent prompt notice of any action commenced against the Company or its subsidiaries or its or their
directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger. The Company will control
the defense of any such transactional litigation threatened against the Company or its subsidiaries, however, the Company agreed not to
settle, or offer to settle, any such transaction litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company is required give Parent the ability to participate in such transactional litigation and to
review and comment on all material filings or responses to be made by the Company and the Company will keep Parent reasonably and
promptly informed with respect to the status of such litigation.

Other Covenants 

        The Merger Agreement contains certain other covenants among Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, including covenants relating to
access to information both before and after the Effective Time, the preparation of this Information Statement, other governmental filings,
obtaining consents, exempting the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement from takeover statutes, and public announcements.

• immediately case and terminate any solicitation, cease and terminate any solicitation, encouragement, discussions or
negotiations with any persons with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or a potential Acquisition Proposal;

Company and its subsidiaries furnished by or on behalf of Company or any of its subsidiaries, and destroy all analyses and
other materials prepared by or on behalf of such person that contain, reflect or analyze such information, in each case, in

connection with or for the purpose of knowingly encouraging or knowingly facilitating an Acquisition Proposal;

        Nothing contained in the Merger Agreement prohibits the Company, the Board or the Special Committee from (i) disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14a-9 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act and Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect or an Acquisition Proposal, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders if in the good faith
judgment of the Board or the Special Committee, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable law or the disclosure is otherwise required under
applicable law. However, complying with such obligations or making such disclosure will not limit or modify the effect that any such
action has under the Merger Agreement (including whether such action constitutes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change).

        For the purposes of the Merger Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means other than the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, relating to, in a single transaction or series
of related transactions, any direct or indirect (a) acquisition of more than 20% of (i) the consolidated assets or (ii) the beneficial ownership
of the equity securities, in each case, of the Company or its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (b) a tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person or group beneficially owning more than 20% of the outstanding equity securities of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, (c) merger, consolidation or other business combination or other transaction involving (i) the Company or its
subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 20% of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) more than 20% of the aggregate equity securities of the Company or of the surviving entity,
(d) liquidation or dissolution of the Company or (e) any combination of the foregoing.

        For purposes of the Merger Agreement, "Company Adverse Recommendation Change" occurs if the Board or any committee thereof
(including the Special Committee) (A) fails to recommend to its stockholders that the requisite stockholder approval be given (the
"Company Board Recommendation"), (B) changes, qualifies, withholds, withdraws or modifies, or publicly proposes to change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (C) takes any formal action or make
any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer (other than a temporary "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or an express rejection of such tender offer or
exchange offer or reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation), (D) fails to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer
or exchange offer within ten (10) business days of the commencement of such offer, (E) adopts, approves, endorses or recommends, or
publicly proposes to approve or recommend to the stockholders of Company an Acquisition Proposal or (F) agrees to take any of the
foregoing actions.

Effect of Termination 

        Upon termination of the Merger Agreement, there will be no liability or obligation on the part of any party, except for (i) obligations
as to the confidence of information as provided by the confidentiality agreement, dated July 17, 2017, between United Rentals, Inc. and
Neff Holdings, (ii) any fees and expenses, including, if due and payable and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein,
the termination fees, (iii) certain other general provisions, which will survive termination, or (ii) any liability arising out of the Willful and
Material Breach (see below for the definition of "Willful and Material Breach") by either party of the Merger Agreement.

        Under the Merger Agreement, "Willful and Material Breach" means fraud with respect to the representations, warranties, covenants
or other agreements of such party set forth in the Merger Agreement or any other transaction document or an act or a failure to act by any
party with the actual or constructive knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such act could cause or result in a material
breach of the Merger Agreement or any other transaction document and does actually cause or result in a material breach the Merger
Agreement or any other transaction document.

Termination Fees 

        Upon termination of the Merger Agreement, under specified circumstances and on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
therein, the Company may be required to pay Parent a termination fee, the amount of which, if and when payable, would be $21,960,000
as follows:

• if an Acquisition Proposal is publicly disclosed or communicated to the Company, the Board or a duly authorized
committee of the Board or made directly to the Company's stockholders and not withdrawn prior to termination of the
Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement is terminated by either party due to the failure to consummate the Merger on or
before the Outside Date or by Parent due to a breach of representations, warranties or covenants by the Company, and
within twelve (12) months of such termination, a definitive agreement is entered into providing for the consummation of an
Acquisition Proposal (substituting 50% for the 20% threshold set forth in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal"), then the
Company shall pay Parent $21,960,000; or 

• if Parent terminates the Merger Agreement due to (x) a material breach by the Company of its obligations regarding non-
solicitation of alternative proposals or the Company (y) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change by the Board or
(z) the Company's entry into or announcement of entry into such a definitive agreement, then the Company shall pay Parent
$21,960,000

        In addition, the parties agree and acknowledge in the Merger Agreement that in the circumstances where Parent is entitled to receive
the termination fee from the Company, receipt of such payment (and, if applicable, any amounts due in connection therewith) shall be,
subject to the right of specific performance, if and solely to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement, the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent and Merger Sub against Company and its subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors,
partners, stockholders, managers, members or affiliates (the "Company Related Parties") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of
the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform under the Merger Agreement or otherwise, and upon payment of such
amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of the Merger
Agreement or the Merger, except in each case in respect of any Willful and Material Breach or as otherwise provided in any other
transaction document.

Indemnification, Expense Advancement, Exculpation and Insurance 

        After the Effective Time and until the sixth anniversary of closing, Parent has agreed to cause the Company (as the surviving
corporation) to indemnify and hold harmless each current and former director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or fiduciaries of the Company and its subsidiaries under any Company benefit plan against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) arising in whole or in part out of (i) the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or is or was a fiduciary of the Company or any of its subsidiaries under Company benefit plans prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) matters, acts, or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and the documents referred therein, the transaction documents and this information statement and the documents referred to
herein to the same extent that such person is entitled to be indemnified as of the date of the Merger Agreement under the Company's
organizational documents and existing indemnification agreements. Parent also agreed to cause the surviving corporation to advance
expenses as incurred by any such indemnified party upon receipt of an undertaking from such indemnified party to the same extent as such
persons are entitled to advancement of expenses as of the date of the Merger Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company's
organizational document and any indemnification agreements disclosed to Parent.

        Parent has agreed to cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its subsidiaries (or a substitute with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts with
terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured in the aggregate) with respect to matters arising on or before the
Effective Time for six years following the Effective Time. However, Parent will not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of
300% of the aggregate annual premium paid as of the date of the Merger Agreement by the Company for such insurance, but in such case
will purchase the maximum coverage available in the surviving corporation's good faith determination for such amount. The Company
may, in consultation with Parent, purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six (6) year prepaid "tail" policy providing equivalent coverage to
that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not
exceed 300% of the aggregate annual premium paid as of the date of the Merger Agreement by the company for such insurance. If such
"tail" prepaid policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent will no longer have any further obligation to
purchase or pay for insurance under the Merger Agreement.

Employee Matters 

        Parent has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each continuing employee receiving benefits under a new benefit plan that
replaces coverage under an existing benefit plan of the Company, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting
periods would apply under the analogous Company benefit plan, and (ii) for the plan year in which the closing occurs, provide each
continuing employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or deductibles paid under an analogous Company
benefit plan. Parent has also agreed to recognize all service of each continuing employee for all purposes in any new employee benefit
plan, except if such recognition would result in duplication of benefits, relate to defined benefit pension plans or retiree welfare benefits,
or relate to any frozen plan or plan that provides grandfathered benefits.

Section 16 Matters 

        Prior to the Effective Time, the Company must take such steps as required to cause to cause any disposition of shares of the
Company's Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in

respect of shares of the Company's Common Stock, including LLC Units and LLC Options, by an individual subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent possible.

Assignment 

        Neither the Merger Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations thereunder may be assigned by any of the parties thereto
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that prior to the Effective Time,
Merger Sub may, without the prior written consent of the Company, assign all or any portion of its rights under the Merger Agreement to
one or more of Parent's direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries or affiliates, and Parent and Merger Sub may collaterally assign their
rights to any financing sources; provided, however, that any such assignment will not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its
obligations under the Merger Agreement.

Specific Performance 

        In the event of a breach or threatened breach of any covenant or obligation in the Merger Agreement, the non-breaching party will be
entitled to seek to obtain an order of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation and
an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach, which will be in addition to any other remedy which the non-breaching party is
entitled at law or in equity, including monetary damages. The Merger Agreement also provides that Parent is responsible for the
performance by Merger Sub of its obligations under the Merger Agreement.

Modification or Amendment 

        Any provision of the Merger Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Company and Parent, or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective and any amendment or modification shall require authorization of the board of directors of Parent (or a duly authorized
committee thereof) with respect to Parent and the Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) with respect to the Company. In
addition, after the delivery of the Stockholder Consent, if any such amendment or waiver will require further approval of the stockholders
of the Company pursuant to applicable law, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver will be subject to such approval.

Fees and Expenses 

        Except as otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby will be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.

Governing Law 

        The Merger Agreement is governed by Delaware law.

Holding's basis in its assets and imputed interest. If the Merger is not consummated and the Tax Receivable Agreement is not terminated,
the Key Holders and the LLC Optionholders will continue to be entitled to receive certain payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement
that could exceed $300 million. As a result of the termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the Key Holders will forego the right to
receive any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement.

        As a result of the Exchanges and the termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement without any payment, the Key Holders will
receive the same per share consideration in the Merger as all other stockholders and will forego the right to receive any payments under
the Tax Receivable Agreement.

        Additionally, pursuant to the Exchange and Termination Agreements, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Registration Rights
Agreement will be terminated.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER 

        The following discussion is a summary of the material United States federal income tax consequences to holders of Class A Common
Stock whose shares are converted to cash in the Merger. This summary does not address any tax consequences of the Merger arising under
the laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction or United States federal laws other than United States federal income tax laws and does
not address tax considerations applicable to holders who receive cash pursuant to the exercise of appraisal rights. This discussion is based
on the Code, applicable United States Treasury Regulations, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), court
decisions and other applicable authorities, all as currently in effect as of the date hereof and all of which are subject to change or differing
interpretations (possibly with retroactive effect). This discussion does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxation that
may be applicable to holders of Class A Common Stock in light of their particular circumstances or holders of Class A Common Stock
subject to special treatment under United States federal income tax law, such as:

• entities treated as partnerships for United States federal income tax purposes, S corporations or other pass-through entities; 

• holders who hold Class A Common Stock as part of a straddle, hedging transaction, synthetic security, conversion
transaction or other integrated investment or risk reduction transaction; 

• holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; 

• United States expatriates; 

• holders who acquired Class A Common Stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as
compensation; 

• holders subject to the United States alternative minimum tax; 

• banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions; 

• regulated investment companies; 

• real estate investment trusts; 

• tax-exempt organizations; 

• brokers or dealers in securities or foreign currencies; and 

• traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment.

        Holders of Class A Common Stock should consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to
them of the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of the Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger (including the application
and effect of any state, local or non-United States income and other tax laws).

        If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) holds
Class A Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. Partners in a partnership holding shares of Class A Common Stock should consult their tax advisors regarding
the tax consequences of the Merger.

        This discussion applies only to holders that hold their shares of Class A Common Stock as a capital asset within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code.

Tax Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders

        The term "U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of Class A Common Stock that is:

• a citizen or individual resident of the United States; 

• a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, created or organized
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia or any entity otherwise treated as a
domestic corporation under the Code; 

• a trust if it (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States
persons (as defined under the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (ii) has a valid
election in effect under applicable United States Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person; or 

• an estate that is subject to United States federal income tax on its income regardless of its source.

        The exchange of shares of Class A Common Stock for cash in the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction to U.S. holders for
United States federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder whose shares of Class A Common Stock are converted to cash in the
Merger will recognize capital gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in such shares. A U.S. holder's
adjusted tax basis will generally equal the price the U.S. holder paid for such shares. Gain or loss will be determined separately for each
block of shares of Class A Common Stock (i.e., shares of Class A Common Stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) owned
by a U.S. holder. Such gain or loss will generally be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder's holding period for the
shares of Class A Common Stock exceeds one year at the time of the consummation of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of non-
corporate U.S. holders are generally subject to reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Capital
gains recognized by individuals, trusts and estates also may be subject to a 3.8% federal Medicare contribution tax.

Tax Consequences of the Merger to Non-U.S. Holders 

        The term "non-U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of Shares that is not a U.S. holder.

        Subject to the discussion below under "—Backup Withholding," any gain realized by a non-U.S. holder upon the exchange of shares
of Class A Common Stock for cash in the Merger will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

• such non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the
taxable year of the consummation of the Merger and certain other conditions are met, in which case such non-U.S. holder
may be subject to a 30% U.S. federal income tax (or a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty) on such non-
U.S. holder's net gain realized; or 

• the gain is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business of such non-U.S. holder (and, if an applicable income tax
treaty so provides, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such non-U.S. holder in the United States), in
which case such non-U.S. holder generally will be taxed in the same manner as a U.S. holder (as described above), except
that if such non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, an additional branch profits tax may apply at a rate of 30% (or a
reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty).

Backup Withholding 

        Under the "backup withholding" provisions of the Code, a holder (or beneficial owner) may be subject to information reporting and
backup withholding on any cash payments such holder receives in exchange for shares of Class A Common Stock in the Merger. However,
a holder (or beneficial owner) generally will not be subject to backup withholding if:

• in the case of a U.S. holder who is not exempt (as described below), such U.S. holder furnishes a correct taxpayer
identification number, certifies that it is not subject to backup withholding on a duly completed IRS Form W-9 (or
applicable successor form) included in the letter of transmittal and otherwise complies with all the applicable requirements
of the backup withholding rules; or 

• such holder provides proof that it is otherwise exempt from backup withholding (including, in the case of a corporation, by
providing a duly completed IRS Form W-9 (or applicable successor form) claiming exempt status or, in the case of a non-
U.S. holder, by providing a duly completed IRS Form W-8 (or applicable successor form) claiming foreign status).

        Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will generally be allowed as a
refund or credit against a holder's (or beneficial owner's) United States federal income tax liability, provided that such holder timely
furnishes the required information to the IRS. Each holder (or beneficial owner) of common shares should consult its own tax advisors as
to the qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such exemption.

        This summary of material United States federal income tax consequences is for general information only and is not tax
advice. You are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of United States federal income tax laws to your
particular situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the United States federal estate or gift tax rules, or under the
laws of any state, local, foreign or other taxing jurisdiction.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS 

        Under the DGCL, you have the right to demand appraisal in connection with the Merger and if the Merger is consummated, to receive
payment in cash for the "fair value" of your shares of Common Stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, together with
interest, if any, as determined by the court, but exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
Merger, in lieu of the Merger Consideration you would otherwise be entitled to pursuant to the Merger Agreement. These rights are known
as appraisal rights. Company stockholders electing to exercise appraisal rights must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL in order to perfect their rights. The Company will require strict compliance with the statutory procedures.

        The following is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of the Delaware statutory procedures required to be followed
properly and in a timely manner by a Company stockholder in order to dissent from the Merger and perfect appraisal rights.

        This summary, however, is not a complete statement of all applicable requirements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which appears in Annex F to this information statement. Failure to precisely follow any of the
statutory procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in a termination or waiver of your appraisal rights. All references in
Section 262 of the DGCL and in this summary to a "stockholder" or "holders of shares" are to the record holder of shares of Common
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time as to which appraisal rights are asserted, unless otherwise indicated.

        Under Section 262 of the DGCL, where a merger agreement relating to a proposed merger is adopted by stockholders acting by
written consent in lieu of a meeting of the stockholders, either the constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or the
surviving or resulting corporation, within 10 days after the effective date of the merger, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to
appraisal rights that the merger has been approved and that appraisal rights are available, and must include in each such notice a copy of
Section 262 of the DGCL. This information statement constitutes such notice of the approval of the Merger and the availability of
appraisal rights under Section 262 to the holders of shares of Common Stock as of September 7, 2017, the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to such notice and Section 262 of the DGCL is attached to this information statement as
Annex F. Any stockholder who wishes to exercise such appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve his, her or its right to do so should
review the following discussion and Annex F carefully, because failure to timely and properly comply with the procedures specified will
result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL.

        In addition, if the notice does not notify the stockholders of the effective date of the merger, either the corporation before the effective
date of the merger or the surviving corporation within 10 days after the effective date of the merger must notify the stockholders entitled to
appraisal of the effective date of the merger; provided, however, that if such notice of the effective date of the merger is sent more than
20 days following the sending of the first notice, the notice of the effective date of the merger need only be sent to each stockholder who is
entitled to appraisal rights and who has properly demanded appraisal of such stockholder's shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL. This information statement does not constitute notice of the effective date of the Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.
Accordingly, the surviving corporation will send a separate notice to stockholders entitled to receive notice of the effective date of the
Merger under Section 262 of the DGCL.

Written Demand by the Record Holder

        Holders of shares of Common Stock who desire to exercise their appraisal rights must deliver a written demand for appraisal of their
shares of the Company within 20 days after the date of mailing of this information statement and the notice attached hereto, which date is
October 1, 2017. A demand

for appraisal will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the Company of the identity of the stockholder and that such stockholder intends
thereby to demand appraisal of such stockholder's shares of Common Stock. If you wish to exercise your appraisal rights you must be the
record holder of such shares of Common Stock on the date the written demand for appraisal is made and you must continue to hold such
shares of Common Stock through the Effective Time. Accordingly, a stockholder who is the record holder of shares of Common Stock on
the date the written demand for appraisal is made, but who thereafter transfers such shares prior to the Effective Time, will lose any right
to appraisal in respect of such shares.

        All written demands for appraisal should be addressed to Neff Corporation, 3750 N.W. 87th Avenue, Suite 400, Miami, Florida 33178,
Attn: Chief Financial Officer.

        To be effective, a demand for appraisal by a Company stockholder must be made by, or in the name of, such registered Company
stockholder and must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the stockholder of record and that such stockholder intends
thereby to demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. Beneficial owners who do not also hold the shares of Common Stock of record may
not directly make appraisal demands to the Company. The beneficial holder must, in such cases, have the registered owner, such as a
brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares. If shares of Common Stock are owned
of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of a demand for appraisal should be made by or for
the fiduciary, and if the shares of Common Stock are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in
common, the demand should be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more
joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or
owners, and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, he or she is acting as agent for the record owner. A record owner,
such as a broker, who holds shares of Common Stock as a nominee for others, may exercise his or her right of appraisal with respect to the
shares of Common Stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial owners. In that case,
the written demand should state the number of shares of Common Stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no number of shares is
expressly stated, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares held in the name of the record owner.

        If you hold your shares of Common Stock in an account with a brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, and you wish to exercise
appraisal rights, you are urged to consult with your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures
for the making of a demand for appraisal.

        Within 120 days after the Effective Time of the Merger, any Company stockholder who has complied with the requirements for
exercise of appraisal rights will, upon written request to the surviving corporation, be entitled to receive a written statement setting forth
the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which demands for
appraisal have been received, and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of
Common Stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, request from the
surviving corporation the statement described in the previous sentence. Such written statement will be mailed to the requesting Company
stockholder within 10 days after such written request is received by the surviving corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the
period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

        Within 120 days after the Effective Time, but not thereafter, either the surviving corporation or any Company stockholder who has
complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition

in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares of Common Stock held by all such
stockholders. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such
person may, in such person's own name, file the petition described in the previous sentence. Upon the filing of the petition by a Company
stockholder, service of a copy of such petition must be made upon the Company, as the surviving corporation. The surviving corporation
has no obligation to file such a petition if Company stockholders demand appraisal. Accordingly, the failure of a Company stockholder to
file such a petition within the period specified could nullify the Company stockholder's previously written demand for appraisal. There is
no present intent on the part of the Company to file an appraisal petition, and Company stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights
should not assume that the Company will file such a petition or that the Company will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair
value of such shares. Accordingly, Company stockholders who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate any petitions necessary
for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.

        If a petition for appraisal is timely filed by a Company stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving
corporation, the surviving corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file with
the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all Company stockholders who have
demanded an appraisal of their shares, and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving
corporation. After notice is made to such Company stockholders as required by the Delaware Court of Chancery, the Delaware Court of
Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing upon the petition to determine those Company stockholders who have complied with
Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to the appraisal rights thereunder. Under Delaware law, the Delaware Court of
Chancery may require stockholders who have demanded appraisal of their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit
their stock certificates to the Delaware Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any
such stockholder who holds stock represented by certificates fails to comply with that direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may
dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder. Notwithstanding a stockholder's compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL, the Court will
dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares
entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the Merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million. Upon application by the surviving corporation or by any
Company stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its discretion, proceed to
trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the Company stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name
appears on the verified list filed by the surviving corporation and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register
in Chancery, if required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to
appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines which Company stockholders are
entitled to appraisal of their shares of Common Stock, the appraisal proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the
Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding, the Delaware
Court of Chancery will appraise the shares of Common Stock, determining the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value
arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be
the fair value. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may
pay to each Company stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest will accrue thereafter only upon the sum
of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery,
and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. The

Company and Parent have made no determination as to whether such a payment may be made if the Merger is consummated and the
Company and Parent reserve the right to make such a payment upon consummation of the Merger. When the fair value has been
determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value upon surrender by those Company stockholders of the
certificates representing their shares of Common Stock. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for
good cause shown, and except as provided above in the event that a payment is made by the surviving corporation before the entry of
judgment in the proceedings, interest from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be
compounded quarterly, and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge), as established from time to
time during the period between the closing date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. When the value is determined, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon accrued during the pendency of the proceeding, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery so determines, to Company stockholders entitled to receive the same (in the case of shares represented by
certificates, payment will be made upon surrender of such certificates).

        In determining fair value, and, if applicable, interest, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant
factors. In Weinberger v. UOP,  Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value
in an appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the
financial community and otherwise admissible in court" should be considered, and that "fair price obviously requires consideration of all
relevant factors involving the value of a company."

        Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the Merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow
exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising
from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to mean that
"elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and
not the product of speculation, may be considered."

        You should be aware that the fair value of your shares of Common Stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be
more than, the same as, or less than the value that you are entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement if you did not seek
appraisal of your shares. Investment banking opinions as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a
sale transaction, such as the Merger, are not opinions as to fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. No representation is made as to the
outcome of the appraisal of fair value by the Delaware Court of Chancery.

        Costs of the appraisal proceeding may be imposed upon the surviving corporation and Company stockholders participating in the
appraisal proceeding by the Delaware Court of Chancery as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon the application of a
Company stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any Company stockholder
in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts,
to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares entitled to appraisal.

        Any Company stockholder who had demanded appraisal rights will not, after the Effective Time, be entitled to vote shares subject to
that demand for any purpose, or to receive payments of dividends or any other distribution with respect to those shares, other than with
respect to payment as of a record date prior to the Effective Time. If any stockholder who demands appraisal of shares of Common Stock
under Section 262 of the DGCL fails to perfect, successfully withdraws or loses such

holder's right to appraisal with respect to such shares, such shares will be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into the
right to receive the cash payment provided pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Moreover, the Delaware Court of Chancery shall dismiss
the appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, and such stockholders will effectively lose
their appraisal rights, unless either (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or
series eligible for appraisal or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million.

        If no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective Time, or if a Company stockholder delivers a written
withdrawal of his, her or its demand for appraisal, and an acceptance of the terms of the Merger within 60 days after the Effective Time (or
thereafter with the written consent of the surviving corporation), then the right of that Company stockholder to appraisal will cease and
that Company stockholder will be entitled to receive the cash payment for shares of his, her or its shares of Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to
any Company stockholder without the prior approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware
Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this sentence will not affect the right of any Company
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw its demand for
appraisal, and to accept the cash that such holder would have received pursuant to the Merger Agreement, within 60 days after the
effective date of the Merger.

        In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, Company stockholders who may wish to dissent from the Merger and
pursue appraisal rights should consult their legal advisors.

MARKET PRICE OF THE CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION 

        The Class A Common Stock is traded on the NYSE under the symbol "NEFF." There is no established public trading market for our
Class B Common Stock. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the intra-day high and low sale prices of our Class A
Common Stock, as reported by the NYSE:

        The closing price of shares of Class A Common Stock on the NYSE on August 16, 2017, the last trading day prior to the
announcement of the Merger Agreement, was $26.15 per share. The closing price of Class A Common Stock on the NYSE on
September 8, 2017, the latest practicable trading date before the filing of this information statement, was $24.98 per share. As of
August 16, 2017, the Company had 8,897,535 shares of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding and 14,951,625 shares of Class B
Common Stock issued and outstanding, all of which will be cancelled as a result of the Exchanges pursuant to the amended and restated
certificate of incorporation.

        As of August 16, 2017, the Company had approximately 3 holders of record of Class A Common Stock and 2 holders of record of
Class B Common Stock. The number of holders is based upon the actual number of holders registered in our records at such date and

        1.4    Effects of the Merger.     At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to all the properties, assets, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises and be subject to all of the debts, liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of Company
and Merger Sub, and the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL, this Agreement and the
Certificate of Merger.

        1.5    Conversion of Capital Stock.     At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any shares of capital stock or Equity Interests of Parent, Merger Sub or Company:

        (a)   Each share of Company Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time after
giving effect to the Specified Exchange (as defined in the Exchange Agreements) (except for, in each case, shares (x) (i) held in the
treasury of Company or (ii) owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries and
(y) Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and automatically converted, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Agreement, into the right to receive an amount equal to $25.00 in cash, without interest thereon (the "Merger Consideration").

        (b)   Each share of Company Class B Common Stock outstanding or held in treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

        (c)   All the shares of Company Class A Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time,
and each certificate (each, an "Old Certificate", it being understood that any reference herein to "Old Certificate" shall be deemed
to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Class A Common Stock)
previously representing any such shares of Company Class A Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, shares of Company Common Stock or other Equity Interests of
Company shall have been increased, decreased or changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities
(other than the issuance of additional shares of capital stock of Company as permitted by this Agreement and the issuance of shares
of Company Class A Common Stock in connection with the Exchanges), including by reason of a reorganization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any other similar event, an
appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement to reflect such event.

Company), Parent or Merger Sub or their direct or indirect Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and neither the
Merger Consideration nor any other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

        1.7    Treatment of Company Equity Awards.     

        (a)   At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Class A Common Stock granted by Company, whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time (each, a "Company Stock Option") shall be
cancelled and shall cease to be outstanding and shall not be assumed.

        (b)   In consideration of the cancelation and termination of each Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and unvested as of the Effective Time, Parent shall issue an option to purchase United Rentals Common Shares (each,
a "Substitute Stock Option"). Each Substitute Stock Option generally shall have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to the Company Stock Option in respect of which such Substitute Stock Option was granted immediately prior
to the Effective Time (including any vesting provisions), provided that (i) each Substitute Stock Option shall be exercisable for that
number of whole United Rentals Common Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (w) the
number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock that were issuable upon the exercise of the Company Stock Option (or
portion thereof) in respect of which such Substitute Stock Option was granted immediately prior to the Effective Time and (x) the
Exchange Ratio and (ii) the per share exercise price for the United Rentals Common Shares issuable upon exercise of such
Substitute Stock Option shall equal the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) of (y) the exercise price per share of
Company Class A Common Stock applicable to the Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) in respect of which such Substitute
Stock Option was granted immediately prior to the Effective Time and (z) the Exchange Ratio.

        (c)   In consideration of the cancelation and termination of each Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and vested (based solely on the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option and without the exercise of any
discretion by Company or any other person) as of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries to pay the holder thereof an amount in cash (less applicable Tax withholdings) within ten (10) days after the Closing
Date equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, minus the per share exercise price for the Company Class A Common
Stock issuable under such Company Stock Option (or portion thereof), multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Class A
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) as of the Effective Time.

        (d)   At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of Company Class A Common Stock granted
by Company, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding as of the Effective Time (a "Company Restricted Stock Unit Award"
and, together with the Company Stock Options, the "Company Equity Awards") shall be canceled and shall cease to be outstanding
and shall not be assumed.

        (e)   In consideration of the cancelation and termination of each Company Restricted Stock Unit Award that is outstanding and
unvested as of the Effective Time, Parent shall issue an award of time-vesting restricted stock units (each a "Substitute RSU
Award") relating to the number of United Rentals Common Shares equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company
Class A Common Stock with respect to which such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award was unvested as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Each Substitute RSU Award issued pursuant to this Section 1.7(e) generally
shall be subject to the same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, any time-based vesting schedule) as applied to the
related Company Restricted Stock Unit Award in respect of which such Substitute RSU Award was granted, provided that any
performance vesting condition shall be waived.

        (f)    In consideration of the cancelation and termination of each Company Restricted Stock Unit Award that is outstanding
and vested (based solely on the terms of the applicable Company

Restricted Stock Unit Award and without the exercise of any discretion by Company or any other person) as of the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to pay the holder thereof an amount in cash within ten
(10) days after the Closing Date equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of
Company Class A Common Stock with respect to which such Company Restricted Stock Unit Award was so vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        (g)   Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Substitute Stock Options and the
Substitute RSU Awards will be revised to reflect that such awards are in respect of United Rentals Common Shares, and may
contain such modifications to the Company Equity Awards as Parent deems appropriate to reflect the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Company becoming a Subsidiary of Parent.

        (h)   Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take all actions necessary to cause the Company Equity Awards to be treated
as set forth in this Section 1.7, including, without limitation, the Company Board and its compensation committee, as applicable,
adopting any resolutions and taking all other actions (including providing any required notices and obtaining any required
consents) that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.7. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each
holder of vested Company Stock Options shall be entitled to exercise his or her vested Company Stock Options prior to the
Effective Time by tendering to Company a check in the full amount of their respective exercise price, in which case such holder
shall be treated as a holder of Company Class A Common Stock under Section 1.5. Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their
respective Subsidiaries shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable to the holders of the Company
Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement such amounts that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries is required to withhold from such holders in connection with such payments under the Code or any other provision of
Tax Laws. To the extent withheld and deducted, such amounts shall be remitted by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries to the applicable Governmental Entity on behalf of the applicable holders of the Company Equity
Awards and treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable holders of the Company Equity
Awards.

        1.8    Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.     At the Effective Time, (a) the certificate of
incorporation of Company shall be amended so as to read in its entirety as set forth on Exhibit B hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and (b) the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read in their
entirety as the bylaws of Merger Sub immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (provided that the name of Merger Sub shall be
replaced with the name of the Surviving Corporation).

        1.9    Directors of the Surviving Corporation.     Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time to be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified or
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION 

        2.1    Paying Agent; Surrender and Payment.     

        (a)   Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a paying agent agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Company with a paying agent designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to Company (the "Paying Agent"). At or
substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited by Merger Sub, with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, cash in an amount
sufficient to allow the Paying Agent to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of all of the shares of
Company Class A Common Stock represented by the Old Certificates, other than Dissenting Shares and shares to be cancelled and
retired pursuant to Sections 1.5(b) and (d) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Fund"). The Paying Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent, provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect
the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Old Certificates. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or as otherwise directed by Parent. As promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than ten (10) calendar days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each person who was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of one or more Old Certificates
representing shares of Company Class A Common Stock at the Effective Time (other than any shares to be cancelled and retired
pursuant to Sections 1.5(b) and (d)), a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery or transfer, as applicable, of the Old Certificates to
the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration (the "Letter of Transmittal"). For the avoidance of doubt, no amount payable in respect of the Company Equity
Awards shall be included in the Payment Fund.

        (b)   Each holder of shares of Company Class A Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (other than the Dissenting Shares and any shares cancelled and retired pursuant to Sections 1.5(b) and (d)) shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the shares of Company Class A Common Stock represented by an Old
Certificate as promptly as reasonably practicable following (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of an Old Certificate (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.1(f)), together with a duly completed and validly executed Letter of
Transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent (or receipt of an "agent's message" by
the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case of book-entry
shares, together with such other documents as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent). No interest will be paid or
accrued with respect to any property to be delivered upon surrender of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.1(b), each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
surrender, the Merger Consideration.

        (c)   If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered
or transferred Old Certificate, as applicable, is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such Old Certificate shall
be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer (in the case of a book-entry share, such Old Certificate shall
be properly transferred), and (ii) the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent in advance any transfer or
other similar Taxes required by reason of such payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Old Certificate, or
required for any

other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

        (d)   After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        (e)   Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of Company for one (1) year after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of Company who have not theretofore
exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of
the Merger Consideration, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common
Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.

        (f)    In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact (in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent) by the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required
by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, and following the Paying Agent's receipt of
Letter of Transmittal required by this Section 2.1 with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the Merger Consideration.

        2.2    Appraisal Rights.     Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock the holder of which has not voted in favor of, or otherwise consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and that
is entitled to and has properly perfected his, her or its right to dissent under Section 262 of the DGCL and has not effectively withdrawn or
lost such right as of the Effective Time with respect to such shares (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right
to receive the Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be entitled only to receive payment of the appraised value of

        (c)   Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material breach of any of the Company IP Contracts and neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has notified in writing any third party, and no third party has notified Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, of any such breach.

        (d)   Company and its Subsidiaries take, and have taken, commercially reasonable measures, generally consistent with
industry standards, to safeguard Company's and its Subsidiaries' Trade Secrets. To the knowledge of Company, (i) no employee,
independent contractor or agent of Company or any of its Subsidiaries has misappropriated any Trade Secrets of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in the course of his or her performance as an employee, independent contractor or agent and (ii) no employee,
independent contractor or agent of Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in material default or breach of any term of any
employment agreement, nondisclosure agreement, assignment of invention agreement or similar agreement or contract relating in
any way to the protection, ownership, development, use or transfer of Intellectual Property of Company or its Subsidiaries. Except

Owned Intellectual Property to any third party, other than pursuant to a written confidentiality agreement.

        (e)   The software, hardware, computer systems, telecommunications equipment and systems, and Internet and intranet sites
(collectively, the "Information Systems") that are used or relied on by Company and its Subsidiaries in the conduct of their business
are in good working condition (ordinary wear and tear excepted), fulfill the purposes for which they were acquired or developed
and have industry standard and commercially reasonable security, back-ups and disaster recovery arrangements in place, except as
would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Company
and its Subsidiaries have met or exceeded commercially reasonable industry standards to safeguard the availability, security and
integrity of the Information Systems and all data and information stored thereon, including from unauthorized access and infection
by unauthorized code, except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Information Systems of Company and its Subsidiaries have not, to Company's knowledge, suffered
any material security breach or material failure. No material included in the Company Owned Intellectual Property contains any
computer code or any other procedure, routine or mechanism which may cause any Company Owned Intellectual Property to be
subject to any Open License Term, except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

        (f)    Each of Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, has a valid and legal right (whether contractually, by Law or
otherwise) to access and use all Personal Information that is accessed and used by such Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the use and operation of the business of Company and its Subsidiaries. Company and each Subsidiary has
commercially reasonable safeguards in place to protect Personal Information in its possession or control from unauthorized access
by any third party, including the employees and contractors of Company and its Subsidiaries. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) there has been no unauthorized
access, use or disclosure of Personal Information in the possession or control of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
contractors, (ii) Company and its Subsidiaries have at all times complied with all applicable Laws relating to privacy, data
protection and the collection and use of personal information and user information including that of its customers and employees,
and they have the unrestricted right to transfer to Surviving Corporation all such information, and (iii) following the Closing Date,
Surviving Corporation shall have rights to use such information equivalent to the rights to use such information that Company and
its Subsidiaries had prior to the Closing Date. Neither the execution, delivery nor performance of this Agreement nor the

currently exists or existed at any time during which any of the Personal Information was collected or obtained.

contravene, conflict with or result in any limitation on the Surviving Corporation's right, title or interest in or to any Company
Owned Intellectual Property.

with Company or its Subsidiaries or has any material interest in any property used by Company or its Subsidiaries, in either case

        3.19    State Takeover Laws.     Assuming the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section 4.1(b) are
true and correct, the Company Board has approved this Agreement, the Transaction Documents (including the Support Agreement and the

that, as of the date thereof, based upon and subject to the factors, assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock,
excluding from such holders Parent and Wayzata Investment Partners LLC and their affiliates and executive officers of the Company. Such
opinion has not been amended, withdrawn or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement. Company has made available to Parent a true,
correct and complete copy of such opinion for informational purposes only.

        3.21    Company Information.     The Information Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) when filed with the SEC and
at the time it is mailed to holders of Company Common Stock and any other documents and financial statements of Company incorporated
by reference in the Information Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not

or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Parent or Merger Sub that such item has had or would reasonably be reasonably expected
to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a Section
of this Article IV shall be deemed to qualify (A) any other Section of this Article IV specifically referenced or cross-referenced and
(B) other sections of this Article IV to the extent it is reasonably apparent (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from
a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure is relevant to such other sections or (b) as disclosed in any Parent SEC Reports filed prior
to the date hereof (but disregarding disclosures contained under the heading "Risk Factors" or disclosures of risks set forth in any
"forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-
looking in nature), Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to Company as follows:

        4.1    Corporate Organization.     

        (a)   Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
the State of Delaware.

        (b)   None of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective controlled affiliates own, directly or indirectly, beneficially (as defined in

exchangeable or exercisable into Company Common Stock, and none of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective controlled affiliates
holds any rights to acquire or vote any shares of Company Common Stock except pursuant to this Agreement. During the three

with any other person, was at any time, or became, an "interested stockholder" of Company as defined in Section 203 of the
DGCL, or has taken any action that would cause the restrictions on business combinations with interested stockholders set forth in
Section 203 of the DGCL to be applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any transactions contemplated hereby.

        4.2    Ownership and Operations of Merger Sub.     Parent owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding Equity Interests of
Merger Sub. Merger Sub was incorporated solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger and has engaged in no other business activities
other than those relating to the Merger.

        4.3    Authority; No Violation.     

        (a)   Each of Parent and Merger Sub has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the Merger has been duly and validly approved by the unanimous vote of the Board of Directors of each of
Parent and Merger Sub, not subsequently rescinded or modified in any way as of the date hereof. The Board of Directors of each of
Parent and Merger Sub has determined that the Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the best
interests of such company and its stockholders. No other proceedings on the part of either Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to
approve this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and perform Parent's
obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and
(assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by Company) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and
Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms (except in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by
the Enforceability Exceptions).

        (b)   Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which Parent or Merger
Sub is a party by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, nor the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby,

constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a right of termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of this
clause (ii)(D)) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations, accelerations or creations which would
not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

consent would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, no consents or
approvals of or filings or registrations with any Governmental Entity are necessary in connection with (A) the execution and delivery by

specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Information Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) when filed

request, in each case other than any such matters that relate to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or (except as
required by Section 6.8) to transactions potentially competing with or alternative to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or proposals from other parties relating to any competing or alternative transactions. Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with Company's regular business operations during any such access. Upon
reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish or otherwise make
available to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, advisors and other representatives of Parent such information
concerning its businesses as is reasonably relevant to Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would, based on the advice of outside counsel, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of
such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any Law, fiduciary duty, or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.
Company will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

        (b)   Parent shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or representatives

        (c)   No investigation by Parent, Company or their respective representatives pursuant to this Section 6.1(c) shall affect or be
deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement is
intended to give either Parent or Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior
to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, it is intended that each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

        6.2    Information Statement.     

        (a)   Parent and Company shall cooperate and promptly prepare and Company shall promptly file with the SEC no later than
ten (10) calendar days after the date of this Agreement the Information Statement. The Information Statement shall contain (i) the
notice of action by written consent required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL and (ii) the notice of availability of appraisal rights
and related disclosure required by Section 262 of the DGCL.

        (b)   Parent and Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Information Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Parent agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it to Company in writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Information Statement will
when filed with the SEC and at the time it is mailed to holders of Company Common Stock, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading. Parent further agrees that if it becomes aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in
the Information Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to

comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to

Parent. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Information Statement has been cleared by the SEC or after ten
(10) calendar days have passed since the date of filing of the preliminary Information Statement with the SEC without notice from
the SEC of its intent to review the Information Statement, Company shall promptly file with the SEC the Information Statement in
definitive form as contemplated by Rule 14c-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act substantially in the form previously cleared or

presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions, and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party, hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act prior to their submission. In connection with the foregoing, with

with respect thereto; and (z) to the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the parties shall not agree to participate in any

provided, however, that (i) nothing in this Agreement will require, or be deemed to require, Parent to agree to any Divestiture
Action or Divestiture Actions with respect to assets or businesses that, individually or in the aggregate, constitute or contribute
more than $25,000,000 of the consolidated revenues of the Company and its Subsidiaries estimated by the Company as of the date

        6.4    Employee Matters.

(i) with respect to any New Plan that provides medical, dental, vision or prescription drug benefits, use commercially reasonable
efforts to (A) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to each such Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents under any New Plans that replaces
coverage under a Company Benefit Plan, except to the extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would
apply under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, and (B) for the plan year in which the Closing occurs, provide each such
Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments or deductibles paid under an analogous
Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year in which the Closing occurs through the Effective Time (to the same
extent that such credit was given under such Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the applicable New Plans for the plan year in which the Closing occurs; and
(ii) recognize all service of each such Continuing Employee with Company and its Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessors,
if applicable) for all purposes in any New Plan; provided that the foregoing service recognition shall not apply (x) to the extent it
would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of services, (y) for purposes of any defined benefit pension plan or
benefit plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, or (z) to any benefit plan that is a frozen plan or provides grandfathered benefits.

        (b)   Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director or consultant of Company or any of its

Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall

program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or

or arrangement after the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
person, other than the parties hereto, including any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

        6.5    Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.     

        (a)   From and after the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary thereof, Parent agrees to cause Surviving Corporation
to indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director, officer or employee of Company and its Subsidiaries or
fiduciaries of Company or any of its Subsidiaries under Company Benefit Plans (in each case, when acting in such capacity)
(collectively, the "Company Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising in
whole or in part out of (i) the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or is or was a fiduciary of Company or any of its Subsidiaries under Company Benefit Plans, in each case at or prior to the
Effective Time or (ii) matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the Merger and
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the Information Statement and the documents
referenced herein and therein, in each case to the same extent (and solely to such extent) as such persons are indemnified as of the
date of this Agreement by Company pursuant to the Charter Documents and any indemnification agreements in existence as of the
date hereof that are set forth on Section 6.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and Parent shall also cause the Surviving
Corporation to advance expenses as incurred by such Company Indemnified Party to the same extent as such persons are entitled to
advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by Company pursuant to the Charter Documents and any
indemnification agreements in existence as of the date hereof that are set forth on Section 6.5 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule; provided, however, that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking
consistent with the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, the governing or organizational documents of any Subsidiary of
Company or any such indemnification agreements, as applicable, and applicable Law to repay such amounts if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. Until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall
not, and shall not permit the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify any provision in the
Surviving Corporation's or its Subsidiaries' certificate of formation, certificate of incorporation, articles of incorporation, operating
agreement, by-laws or equivalent governing documents as in effect as of the date hereof relating to the exculpation or
indemnification (including fee advancement) of any Company Indemnified Party in a manner that would adversely affect the rights
of any Company Indemnified Party thereunder.

        (b)   Subject to the following sentence, until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by Company (provided, that the
Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured in the aggregate) with respect to claims
against the present and former officers and directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which
occurred at or before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that the
Parent and Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the
aggregate annual premium paid as of the date hereof by Company for such

insurance (the "Premium Cap"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporation's good faith
determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing,
Company, in consultation with Parent may (and at the request of Parent, Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at
or prior to the Effective Time a six (6) year "tail" policy under Company's existing directors and officers insurance policy
providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an

any Law or Order in effect at the time of such termination that permanently enjoins or otherwise prohibits or makes illegal

the part of Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by Company, which breach or
failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or
warranties to be true), would give rise to, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.2(a) or (b) or Section 7.3(a) or (b), as the case may be, and which is not cured within the earlier of the Outside Date and
thirty (30) days following written notice to Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or to Parent, in the case of a
termination by Company, or by its nature or timing is incapable of being cured during such period; provided, that the terminating
party (or Merger Sub, in the case of a termination by Parent) is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
agreement, covenant or other obligation contained herein which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate
with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would give rise to or constitute,
if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or (b) or Section 7.3(a) or (b),
as the case may be;

        (d)   by Parent, if: (i) the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; (ii) Company

Company Board or the Special Committee shall have publicly announced its intention to do any of the foregoing;

        (e)   by Company, if (i) all of the conditions to Closing set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied and

termination, capable of being satisfied),

GENERAL PROVISIONS 

        10.1    Nonsurvival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements.     None of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement (other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall survive in accordance with its terms) shall survive the Effective Time, except for Section 6.5, Section 6.6 and for those other
covenants and agreements contained herein and therein which by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the
Effective Time which shall survive until performed.

        10.2    Amendment.     Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented solely
by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by, the board of directors of Parent (or duly authorized committees thereof), with
respect to Parent, and the Company Board (or duly authorized committees thereof), with respect to Company; provided, however, that after
Requisite Company Vote, there may not be any amendment, modification or supplement of this Agreement that requires further approval
under applicable Law without such approval having first been obtained. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented
in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment
hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the time of the amendment.

        10.3    Extension; Waiver.     At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Company, on the

further approval of such stockholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any portion thereof that requires further approval
under applicable Law without such approval having first been obtained. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect
to, any subsequent or other failure.

        10.4    Expenses.     Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3 and Section 8.2, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with

Article II, which shall be enforceable by the stockholders of Company and holders of Company Equity Awards to the extent necessary to
receive the consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Article II. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are
the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. In some instances, the representations and

the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and
warranties in this Agreement or characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

remedy at law in the event that any of the obligations of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including

monetary damages. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law
would be adequate, (b) an award of performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity, and (c) any requirement
under any Law to post security or a bond or similar undertaking as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

        10.13    Severability.     The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision
or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such
jurisdiction or the application of that provision, in any other jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in
such jurisdiction such that a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted for that provision in order to carry out, so far as may be
valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision.

        10.14    Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission.     This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in
connection with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a
facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or
instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in
person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf"
format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument
was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.

enforcement of any agreement), any amendment or restatement of the Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws, or any
other action (or failure to act), to the extent such agreement, amendment or restatement or other action or failure to act is

        (b)   Each Stockholder agrees not to enter into any agreement or commitment with any Person the effect of which would

agreements set forth in this Article II.

        Section 2.2    Irrevocable Proxy.     

        (a)   As security for and in furtherance of the Stockholders' agreements in Section 2.1 of this Agreement, each Stockholder
hereby appoints Parent and Parent's designees, and each of them individually, as such Stockholder's proxy and attorney-in-fact
(with full power of substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of such Stockholder, to vote, prior to the termination of this
Agreement, all Stockholder Owned Shares owned by such Stockholder (at any meeting of the Company's stockholders (or any
adjournment or postponement thereof), however called), or to execute one or more written consents in respect of such Stockholder
Owned Shares, in either case solely with respect to the matters described in Section 2.1(a) of this Agreement and in the manner
expressly provided in Section 2.1(a). The foregoing proxy granted by each Stockholder shall become immediately and
automatically exercisable by Parent (and Parent's designees) if, and only if, (x) such Stockholder fails for any reason to comply
with any of its voting and other obligations set forth in Section 2.1(a) above and (y) such Stockholder shall have failed to so
comply within one (1) business day after receipt by such Stockholder of written notice of demand for compliance from Parent,
whereupon Parent shall then immediately and automatically have the right to cause to be present or vote such Stockholder's
Stockholder Owned Shares, or to execute one or more written consents in respect of such Stockholder's Stockholder Owned
Shares, solely with respect to the meeting or matter for which such Stockholder failed to be present, vote or consent (as applicable)
in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1(a).

        (b)   The proxy granted by each Stockholder pursuant to Section 2.2(a) shall (i) be valid and irrevocable until the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with (or as otherwise provided in) Section 5.1 hereof and (ii) automatically terminate
and be deemed revoked upon the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with (or as otherwise provided in) Section 5.1
hereof. Each Stockholder represents that any and all other proxies and powers of attorney heretofore given in respect of the
Stockholder Owned Shares owned by such Stockholder that are currently in effect are revocable, and that such other proxies have
been revoked. Each Stockholder affirms that the proxy granted by such Stockholder pursuant to Section 2.2(a) is: (x) given (A) in
connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement and (B) to secure the performance of such Stockholder's obligations under
Section 2.1(a), (y) coupled with an interest and may not be revoked or terminated except as otherwise provided in this Agreement
and (z) intended to be irrevocable prior to valid termination of this Agreement. All authority conferred by each Stockholder to
Parent and Parent's designees pursuant to Section 2.2(a) shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of such Stockholder.
Subject to the other terms and provisions of this Agreement, each Stockholder shall retain the right to vote or cause to be voted all
of such Stockholder's Stockholder Owned Shares in its sole discretion on all matters not described in Section 2.1(a). Each
Stockholder agrees that it will not take any action that would render invalid the valid exercise of the proxy granted by each
Stockholder pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in accordance with its terms by Parent and Parent's designees.

assign or otherwise dispose of (including, without limitation, any Constructive Disposition) (collectively, a "Transfer"), or enter

Shares or Stockholder Owned Units (or any right, title or interest thereto or therein);

        (b)   deposit any of such Stockholder's Stockholder Owned Shares or Stockholder Owned Units into a voting trust or grant any
proxies or enter into a voting agreement, power of attorney or voting trust with respect to any of such Stockholder's Stockholder
Owned Shares or Stockholder Owned Units;

        (c)   acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, directly or indirectly, by purchase or otherwise, any material assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

        (d)   make, or in any way participate in, directly or indirectly, any "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are used in the
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission) to vote any voting securities of the Company to (i) not adopt the Merger
Agreement or (ii) approve any other matter that if approved would reasonably be expected to interfere, impair or delay the
consummation of the Merger;

        (e)   make any public announcement with respect to, or submit a proposal for, or offer for (with or without conditions), any
extraordinary transaction involving the Company or its securities or material assets, except as required by Law;

        (g)   agree (whether or not in writing) to take any of the actions referred to in this Section 3.1.

its Stockholder Owned Shares and/or Stockholder Owned Units with any custodian, broker, nominee or other Person who holds such
Stockholder's Stockholder Owned Shares or Stockholder Owned Units on behalf of such Stockholder solely for purposes of facilitating the
Specified Exchange (as defined in the Key Holders Exchange Agreement) provided that such Stockholder maintains the sole power to
direct the vote and disposition of such Stockholder Owned Shares and Stockholder Owned Units.

accordance with Section 5.1 hereof, each Stockholder shall promptly notify Parent of the number of Company Shares or LLC Units, if any,
as to which such Stockholder acquires record or beneficial ownership after the date hereof, except for any Company Shares acquired by
such Stockholder in the Specified Exchange. Any Company Shares or LLC Units as to which such Stockholder acquires record or
beneficial ownership after the date hereof and prior to termination of this Agreement (including Company Shares acquired by such
Stockholder in the Specified Exchange) shall be Stockholder Owned Shares or Stockholder Owned Units, as applicable, for purposes of

constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or (E) otherwise knowingly facilitate an
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) shall promptly (and in any case within one (1) business day) notify Parent or its Representatives in
writing of such Stockholder's receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for discussions or negotiations with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, and provide Parent with copies of all documents and other written communications received by such

their capacities as such) will be deemed not to be a Representative of any such Stockholder. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) nothing
in this Section 3.3 shall affect in any way the obligations of any Person (including the Company and its Representatives) under the
Merger Agreement, and (ii) the Company is not a Representative of any Stockholder.

Stockholder or any of its properties or assets may be bound or affected, except for, in the case of clause (b)(ii), any such violations,
conflicts, losses, defaults, terminations, cancellations or accelerations that would not reasonably be expected to prevent the performance by
such Stockholder of its obligations under this Agreement.

such Stockholder's knowledge, threatened against or involving or affecting, such Stockholder, its Company Shares or its LLC Units that

Stockholders, (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms and (iii) the consummation of the Merger.
In addition, subject to Section 5.1(b), this Agreement shall terminate upon the election of the Stockholders if there shall be any

remedies (at Law or in equity) against any other party hereto for such party's willful and material breach of any of the terms of this
Agreement prior to such termination. For purposes of this Agreement, the "willful and material breach" by any party hereto of the
terms of this Agreement shall mean an act or a failure to act by such party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act or
failure to take such act is reasonably likely to cause or result in a material breach of this Agreement and does actually cause or
result in a material breach of this Agreement. The provisions of this Article V and Article VI hereof shall survive the termination of
this Agreement. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 5.1(a), the obligations of the Stockholders
hereunder shall apply whether or not the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any action described herein is recommended by the
Company Board (or any committee thereof).

and to the extent such Stockholder becomes aware that any such information has become false or misleading in any material respect. Each
Stockholder agrees not to issue any press release or make any other public statement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby without the prior written consent of Parent, except for filings required under the
Exchange Act or such publication or disclosure as may be required by applicable Law, provided, that, to the extent practicable, Parent shall
be afforded a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such proposed filing, publication or disclosure.

        Section 6.3    Further Actions.    From time to time, at the reasonable request of Parent and without further consideration, prior to the
termination of this Agreement, each Stockholder shall execute and deliver such additional documents and instruments and take all such
further action as may be reasonably required to consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

        Section 6.4    Amendments and Waivers.    Except for amendments to Schedule I hereto in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise,
except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. No
failure on the part of any party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or of any other power, right, privilege or remedy. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

        Section 6.5    Counterparts.    This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (including by facsimile or other
electronic means, including signatures received as a .pdf attachment to electronic mail), all of which shall be considered one and the same

        Section 6.11    Specific Performance.     The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached and that the parties may not have an
adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the obligations of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific
terms or otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, including monetary damages. Each of the parties hereby
further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate, (b) an award of
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity, and (c) any requirement under any Law to post security or a
bond or similar undertaking as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

        Section 6.12    Fees and Expenses.    Except as otherwise provided herein, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
costs and expenses.

        Section 6.13    Ownership Interest.    Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect
ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Stockholder Owned Shares or Stockholder Owned Units. All rights,
ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Stockholder Owned Shares and the Stockholder Owned Units shall remain vested
in and belong to the Stockholders, and Parent shall have no authority to direct the Stockholders in the voting or disposition of any of the
Stockholder Owned Shares or the Stockholder Owned Units, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

        Section 6.14    Capacity.    Parent acknowledges that nothing herein shall limit or affect any Affiliate of any Stockholder who serves
as an officer, manager or director of the Company or any of its subsidiaries solely to the extent acting in its capacity as an officer, manager
or director of the Company or any such subsidiaries, and no actions or omissions of any such Affiliate acting in such capacity shall be
deemed a breach of this Agreement by any Stockholder. For purposes of this Section 6.14, the term Affiliate shall be deemed to include,
with respect to either Stockholder, the directors, managers, officers, members, partners, stockholders and employees of such Stockholder
or any Affiliate or Related Fund of such Stockholder.

        Section 6.15    Non-Recourse.     Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this Agreement, and notwithstanding
the fact that the Stockholders may be partnerships, the parties hereto covenant, agree and acknowledge that no recourse under this
Agreement shall be had against any former, current or future directors, officers, agents, Affiliates, limited partners, general partners,
members, managers, employees, stockholders or equity holders of any Stockholder, or any former, current or future directors, officers,
agents, Affiliates, employees, general or limited partners, members, managers, employees, stockholders or equity holders of any of the
foregoing, as such (any such Person, a "No Recourse Party"), whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no liability
whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any No Recourse Party for any obligation of any Stockholder under
this Agreement for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their creation.

        Section 6.16    Obligations Several.     The obligations of the Stockholders under this Agreement shall be several and not joint and
several.

all of the LLC Units owned by each of the Stockholders (as set forth next to such Stockholder's name on Exhibit A) shall be

        (b)   Immediately prior to the Effective Time and simultaneous with the consummation of the Specified Exchange, Company
shall (i) issue to each of the Stockholders the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock set forth next to such
Stockholder's name on Exhibit A, and (ii) duly deliver to each Stockholder a certificate issued in the name of such Stockholder

consummate any Exchange or Redemption.

        2.    Terminations.    

        (a)   Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, without the requirement for any further action by any of the Parties,

respective Subsidiaries relating thereto shall be irrevocably cancelled, extinguished and waived. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Tax Receivable Agreement (including Sections 4.1(b) and 4.3 thereof), none of the Stockholders, the Management
Representative, the LLC Optionholders, Company, the Surviving Corporation, Holdings, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall have any payment or other obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement resulting from the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or otherwise. Each of the Stockholders hereby

Receivable Agreement pursuant hereto and it is doing so voluntarily and with a full understanding that it is foregoing such benefits
without receipt of any payments or other consideration therefor. Each of Company and Parent hereby acknowledges and agrees
that the substantial economic, financial and pecuniary benefits that the Stockholders are foregoing as a result of the termination of
the Tax Receivable Agreement pursuant hereto is conferring substantial economic, financial and pecuniary benefits to Company

        (b)   Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, without the requirement for any further action by any of the Parties,
the Registration Rights Agreement shall be irrevocably terminated at no cost to the Stockholders, the Management Representative,
the LLC Optionholders, Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries and shall be of no
further force or effect, and all liabilities of the Stockholders, the Management Representative, the LLC Optionholders, Company,
the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective Subsidiaries relating thereto shall be irrevocably cancelled, extinguished and
waived.

        (c)   Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, without the requirement for any further action by any of the Parties, all
agreements (other than (i) the Holdings LLC Agreement, (ii) the Support Agreement, (iii) this Agreement, (iv) the Indemnity
Agreements set forth in Section 6.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (v) the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws,

parenthetical being referred to herein as the "Excepted Agreements")) between the Stockholders or their affiliates, on the one hand,
and Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand (such agreements, the "Related Party Agreements"), shall be
irrevocably terminated at no cost to the Stockholders, Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and shall be of no further force or effect, and all liabilities of the Stockholders, Company and the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries relating thereto shall be irrevocably cancelled, extinguished and waived. Schedule 1

indenture, deed of trust, license, permit, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which such Stockholder is a party, or
by which such Stockholder or any of its properties or assets may be bound or affected, except for, in the case of clause (ii)(C), any
such violations, conflicts, losses, defaults, terminations, cancellations or accelerations that would not reasonably be expected to
prevent the performance by such Stockholder of its obligations under this Agreement.

        (d)    Absence of Litigation.    As of the date hereof, there is no suit, action, investigation, claim or proceeding pending or, to
such Stockholder's knowledge, threatened against or involving or affecting, such Stockholder, its shares of Company Class B
Common Stock or its LLC Units that would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of such Stockholder to perform fully its
obligations hereunder or to consummate on a timely basis the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated by such
Stockholder.

        (e)    Brokers.    No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial
advisor's or other similar fee or commission that is payable by Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
such Stockholder (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any such broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person
retained or engaged by Company).

such Party's knowledge, threatened against or involving or affecting, such Party that would reasonably be expected to impair the
ability of such Party to perform fully its obligations hereunder or to consummate on a timely basis the transactions contemplated
hereby to be consummated by such Party.

consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, among the assets of Holdings in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
(the "Allocation"). The Allocation shall be part of this Agreement. Following the Closing Date, neither Parent, Company nor
Holdings shall amend or otherwise modify the Allocation without the prior written consent of the Stockholders.

        (c)   Following the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and, subject to the remaining provisions of
this Section 6(c), file or cause to be filed prior to the due date therefor, all Tax Returns for Holdings and its Subsidiaries for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, or any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the
Closing Date, in either such case that are filed after the Closing Date, and the appropriate officer of Holdings or such Subsidiary
shall sign and timely file same. All Tax Returns to be prepared by Parent pursuant to this Section 6(c) shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the pre-Closing practices of Holdings and its Subsidiaries. With respect to all Tax Returns to be prepared by Parent
pursuant to this Section 6(c), (i) Parent shall provide the Stockholders with drafts of such Tax Returns at least forty-five (45) days
prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns, (ii) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax

independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Parent and the Stockholders for resolution on a basis consistent with the pre-
Closing practices of Holdings and its Subsidiaries with respect to such items, calculations or other matters.

        (d)   The Parties acknowledge and agree that any deductions or other Tax benefits attributable to Holdings and/or any of its
Subsidiaries and related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including any deductions or other Tax benefits
attributable to the payment of any amounts to employees or other service providers, lenders or otherwise, whether or not any such
amounts are actually paid on the Closing Date) will be reported on Holdings' final partnership Tax Return for its taxable period
ending on the Closing Date.

        (e)   Parent and Company shall not initiate any claim for refund or amend any Tax Return in a manner which could adversely
affect any of the Stockholders without the prior written consent of the Stockholders.

        (f)    If (i) there shall be any inquiry, claim, assessment, audit, administrative or judicial proceeding, or similar event with
respect to the Allocation or Taxes or any Tax matter relating, or with respect to, any taxable period of Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries ending on or before the Closing Date, or any taxable period of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries beginning before
the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (any of the foregoing, a "Tax Matter"), and (ii) any such Tax Matter (or the
resolution thereof) could adversely affect any of the Stockholders, then Parent shall (x) keep the Stockholders reasonably and
timely informed with respect to such Tax Matter, (y) in good faith, allow the Stockholders to make comments to Parent regarding
the conduct of or positions taken in any such Tax Matter and (z) not enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to such

and third sentences of Section 9.01 of the Holdings LLC Agreement as in effect as of the date hereof (such obligations,
collectively, the "Surviving Reporting Obligation"). Effective immediately following the Effective Time, Company, the Surviving
Corporation and Holdings shall have no further obligations or liabilities (other than obligations and/or liabilities under or with
respect to the Continuing Provisions) to the Stockholders pursuant to or in respect of the Holdings LLC

Agreement and the Surviving Company may amend, restate or terminate the Holdings LLC Agreement in its sole discretion;
provided, however, that the Continuing Provisions shall continue in full force and effect, and the Stockholders and their respective
Releasing Representatives, shall continue to have the benefits thereof, notwithstanding any such amendment, restatement or
termination.

        (h)   The Parties agree to file all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594 or any other applicable form) consistently with this
Section 6.

        (i)    The Parties acknowledge and agree that the fair market value of the shares of Company Class A Common Stock to be
received in the Specified Exchange shall be determined based upon the dollar amount of the Merger Consideration and that the
"Common Unit Redemption Price" (as defined in the Holdings LLC Agreement) is inapplicable to a Share Settlement (as defined
in the Holdings LLC Agreement).

        7.    Miscellaneous.    

        (a)    Term.    This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect unless and until the Support Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms (except for a termination of the Support Agreement on account of the consummation of the Merger). In
the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (i) this Agreement shall automatically and
immediately terminate and be of no further force and effect, all without the need for any further action of the part of (or notice to)
any person and (ii) there shall be no liability or obligation hereunder on the part of any Party or any of their respective affiliates, or
any of their respective managers, directors, stockholders, members, partners, officers, employees, agents, consultants, accountants,
attorneys, investment bankers, financial advisors, representatives, successors or assigns. Without limiting the immediately
preceding sentence, if this Agreement is terminated then the Stockholders shall not be required to consummate the Specified
Exchange. None of the representations or warranties made by any Party in Section 3 or Section 5 hereof, as applicable, shall
survive the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time.

        (b)    Further Actions.    Following the date hereof, the Parties shall take all actions reasonably necessary and execute and
deliver all documents and instruments to each other and third parties (including Company's stock transfer agent) reasonably
requested by a Party to give effect to the transactions contemplated hereby immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Parties
agree that the Effective Time shall not occur until such time as all of the transactions contemplated by Sections 1 and 2 have
become effective.

        (c)    Amendments and Waivers.    Except for amendments to Exhibit A as contemplated by Section 1 (a), this Agreement may
not be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in
writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the Parties. No failure on the part of any Party
to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any Party in exercising any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no
single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right, privilege or remedy. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such Party, but such waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

        (d)    Counterparts.    This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (including by facsimile or other
electronic means, including signatures received as a .pdf attachment to

arising out of or relating hereto shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles thereof. Each Party agrees that any action or proceeding in respect of any claim
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought, heard, tried and determined

accordance with Section 7(f) or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, shall be valid, effective and sufficient
service thereof. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE
EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND

SUCH ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS

assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and any transferee
of LLC Units owned by either of the Stockholders. Any transferee in a Permitted Transfer (as defined in the Support Agreement)
of LLC Units owned by either of the Stockholders shall execute and deliver to Parent a written agreement, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, obligating such transferee to be bound by the terms of this Agreement with respect to such LLC
Units. This Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to and does not confer upon
any Person (other than the Parties and, solely with respect to Section 7(k) hereof, the No Recourse Parties (as defined below)) any
rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein.

        (i)    Severability.    The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable. Whenever possible, each provision or
portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law,
but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect
under any applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or
portion of any provision in such jurisdiction or the application of that provision, in any other jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall
be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such that a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted for that
provision in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable
provision.

        (j)    Enforcement.    The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached and that the Parties may not have an adequate remedy
at Law in the event that any of the obligations of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof,
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, including monetary damages. Each of the Parties
hereby further waives (i) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate, (ii) an award

terminated by the parties thereto, (b) the Registration Rights Agreement to be terminated by the parties thereto, and (c) (i) the LLC

number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock.

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in
this Agreement, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

        1.    Exchange and Exercise.     

        (a)   Immediately prior to the Effective Time (but immediately after the Specified LLC Option Exercise (as defined below))
and pursuant to Sections 11.01 through 11.03 of the Holdings LLC Agreement, all of the LLC Units owned by each of the LLC
Optionholders (after giving effect to the Specified LLC Option Exercise) shall be exchanged directly with Company on a one-for-
one basis for shares of Company Class A Common Stock (the "Resulting Shares") (each such Exchange shall be collectively
referred to herein as the "Specified Exchange").

        (b)   Immediately prior to the Effective Time and simultaneous with the consummation of the Specified Exchange, Company
shall (i) issue to each of the LLC Optionholders such LLC Optionholder's Resulting Shares and (ii) duly deliver to each LLC
Optionholder a certificate issued in the name of such LLC Optionholder representing such LLC Optionholder's Resulting Shares,

of such LLC Optionholder. Company covenants that all shares of Company Class A Common Stock issuable to the LLC
Optionholders in the Specified Exchange will, upon issuance, be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, free and clear of all
taxes and Liens of any kind (except for transfer restrictions of general applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act
and state securities laws).

        (c)   The LLC Optionholders, Holdings and Company hereby (i) agree that this Agreement shall constitute the Redemption

Interests of Holdings outstanding other than such LLC Options and LLC Units owned by the Stockholders.

        (f)    H&E Termination.    Prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Parties, the H&E Termination occurred
and became effective.

        5.    Tax Matters.     

        Company shall and, following the Merger, Parent will cause Company and the Surviving Corporation to, comply with the obligations
of Company under (i) Section 8.03 of the Holdings LLC Agreement as in effect as of the date hereof and (ii) the second and third
sentences of Section 9.01 of the Holdings LLC Agreement as in effect as of the date hereof (such obligations, collectively, the "Surviving
Reporting Obligation"). Effective immediately following the Effective Time, Company, the Surviving Corporation and Holdings shall
have no further obligations or liabilities (other than obligations and/or liabilities under or with respect to the Continuing Provisions) to
the LLC Optionholders or the Management Representative pursuant to or in respect of the Holdings LLC Agreement and the Surviving
Company may amend, restate or terminate the Holdings LLC Agreement in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the Continuing
Provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

        6.    Miscellaneous.     

        (a)    Term.    This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect unless and until the Support Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms (except for a termination of the Support Agreement on account of the consummation of the Merger). In
the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, (i) this Agreement shall automatically and
immediately terminate and be of no further force and effect, all without the need for any further action of the part of (or notice to)
any person and (ii) there shall be no liability or obligation hereunder on the part of any Party or any of their respective affiliates, or
any of their respective managers, directors, stockholders, members, partners, officers, employees, agents, consultants, accountants,
attorneys, investment bankers, financial advisors, representatives, successors or assigns. Without limiting the immediately
preceding sentence, if this Agreement is terminated then the Stockholders shall not be required to consummate the Specified
Exchange. None of the representations or warranties made by any Party in Section 3 or Section 4 hereof, as applicable, shall
survive the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time.

        (b)    Further Actions.    Following the date hereof, the Parties shall take all actions reasonably necessary and execute and
deliver all documents and instruments to each other and third parties (including Company's stock transfer agent) reasonably
requested by a Party to give effect to the transactions contemplated hereby immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Parties
agree that the Effective Time shall not occur until such time as all of the transactions contemplated by Sections 1 and 2 have
become effective.

course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on
behalf of each of the Parties. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, and no delay on the part of any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall
operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege

the part of a Party to any such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party, but such
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

regard to any applicable conflicts of law principles thereof. Each Party agrees that any action or proceeding in respect of any claim
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought, heard, tried and determined
exclusively in the Chosen Courts, and, solely in connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are
the subject of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts,

accordance with Section 6(f) or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, shall be valid, effective and sufficient
service thereof. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE

EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS

Table of Contents

        (g)    Entire Agreement.    This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) constitutes the
entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings.

        (h)    Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries; Transferees.    Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of
the other Parties; provided that Parent may assign this Agreement to one or more of its direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries. No assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment in
contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement (including the
documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to and does not confer upon any Person (other than the Parties and,
solely with respect to Section 6(k) hereof, the No Recourse Parties (as defined below)) any rights or remedies hereunder, including
the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein.

        (i)    Severability.    The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed severable. Whenever possible, each provision or
portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law,
but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect
under any applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or
portion of any provision in such jurisdiction or the application of that provision, in any other jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall
be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such that a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted for that
provision in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable
provision.

        (j)    Enforcement.    The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached and that the Parties may not have an adequate remedy
at Law in the event that any of the obligations of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof,
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, including monetary damages. Each of the Parties
hereby further waives (i) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate, (ii) an award
of performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity, and (iii) any requirement under any Law to post
security or a bond or similar undertaking as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

        (k)    Non-Recourse.    Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this Agreement, and notwithstanding the
fact that the Stockholders may be partnerships, the Parties covenant, agree and acknowledge that no recourse under this Agreement
shall be had against any former, current or future directors, officers, agents, affiliates, limited partners, general partners, members,
managers, employees, stockholders or equity holders of any Stockholder, or any former, current or future directors, officers, agents,
affiliates, employees, general or limited partners, members, managers, employees, stockholders or equity holders of any of the
foregoing, as such (any such Person, a "No Recourse Party"), whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged
that no liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any No Recourse Party for any obligation of
any Stockholder under

        (m)    Certain Acknowledgments.    Parent, Holdings and Company hereby irrevocably acknowledge and agree that:

          (i)  the consummation of the Specified Exchange by each of the LLC Optionholders shall be exempt from the
operation of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act; and

         (ii)  the fair market value of each of the LLC Units owned each of the LLC Optionholders that are exchanged for
shares of Company Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Specified Exchange is equal to the Merger Consideration and,
as such, there is no profit or gain realized by any of the LLC Optionholders upon the sale or other disposition of any such
shares of Company Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Merger.

Annex E 

August 16, 2017

Board of Directors
Neff Corporation
3750 N.W. 87th Avenue, Suite 400
Miami, FL 33178

Gentlemen:

        Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ("Deutsche Bank") has acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of Neff Corporation (the
"Company") in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 13, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), among the
Company, United Rentals (North America), Inc. ("Parent"), and UR Merger Sub II Corporation, a subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub")
which provides, among other things, for the merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the Company, as a result of which the
Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "Transaction"). In connection with the Transaction, (i) each of the
common units (the "LLC Units") of Neff Holdings LLC not owned by the Company will be exchanged immediately prior to the Merger on
a one-for-one basis for shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Company Common Stock"), of the Company,
(ii) each of the options to purchase LLC Units (the "LLC Options") not owned by the Company will be exercised into LLC Units (net of
withholding taxes) and such LLC Units will be exchanged immediately prior to the Merger on a one-for-one basis for shares of Company
Common Stock, (iii) each share of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class B Common Stock"), of the Company will
be cancelled simultaneous with the exchange of LLC Units for shares of Company Common Stock described above, (iv) the Tax
Receivable Agreement (as defined below) will be terminated immediately prior to the Merger without payment, and (v) as a result of the
Merger, each share of Company Common Stock (including shares issued in the exchanges referred to in clauses (i) and (ii)) other than
(A) shares held in the treasury of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (B) shares owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub
and their respective subsidiaries and (C) dissenting shares, will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined
below). For purposes of this opinion, "Merger Consideration" means $25.00 in cash, without interest thereon. The Merger Consideration
will be the sole consideration given to and received by the holders of LLC Units, LLC Options, Class B Common Stock, Company
Common Stock and the counterparties under the Tax Receivable Agreement in connection with the Transaction.

        You have requested our opinion, as investment bankers, as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a financial point of view,
to the holders of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, excluding Parent and its affiliates and executive officers of the
Company.

        In connection with our role as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company, and in arriving at our opinion, we reviewed
certain publicly available financial and other information concerning the Company, and certain internal analyses, financial forecasts and
other information relating to the Company prepared by management of the Company. We have also held discussions with certain senior
officers and other representatives of the Company regarding the businesses and prospects of the Company. In addition, we have
(i) reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock, (ii) compared certain financial and stock market
information for the Company with, to the extent publicly available, similar information for certain other companies we considered relevant
whose securities are publicly traded, (iii) reviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain business combinations
which we deemed relevant, (iv) reviewed a draft dated August 13, 2017 of the Merger Agreement and certain related documents, including
the Tax Receivable Agreement, dated as of November 26, 2014 (as amended, the "Tax Receivable Agreement"), by and among the
Company, Wayzata Opportunities Fund II, L.P. ("Opportunities Fund"), Wayzata

Opportunities Fund Offshore II, L.P. ("Opportunities Fund Offshore"), the Management Representative (as defined therein) and the LLC
Optionholders (as defined therein), a draft dated August 13, 2017 of the Exchange and Termination Agreement by and among the
Company, Parent, Opportunities Fund, and Opportunities Fund Offshore, a draft dated August 13, 2017 of the Exchange and Termination
Agreement by and among the Company, Parent, the Management Representative (as defined therein) and the LLC Optionholders (as
defined therein), and a draft dated August 13, 2017 of the Support Agreement by and among Parent, Opportunities Fund and Opportunities
Fund Offshore (collectively, the "Ancillary Agreements"), and (v) performed such other studies and analyses and considered such other
factors as we deemed appropriate.

        We have not assumed responsibility for independent verification of, and have not independently verified, any information, whether
publicly available or furnished to us, concerning the Company, including, without limitation, any financial information considered in
connection with the rendering of our opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of our opinion, we have, with your knowledge and permission,
assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information. We have not conducted a physical inspection of any of
the properties or assets, and have not prepared, obtained or reviewed any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or
liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or off-balance-sheet assets or liabilities), of the Company or Parent or any of their
respective subsidiaries, nor have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company, Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries
under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. With respect to the financial forecasts made available to us and used in
our analyses, we have assumed with your knowledge and permission that such forecasts have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting
the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the matters covered thereby. In rendering
our opinion, we express no view as to the reasonableness of such forecasts and projections or the assumptions on which they are based.
Our opinion is necessarily based upon economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as
of, the date hereof. We expressly disclaim any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting
our opinion of which we become aware after the date hereof.

        For purposes of rendering our opinion, we have assumed with your knowledge and permission that, in all respects material to our
analysis, the Transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
without any waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement that would be material to our analysis. We also have
assumed with your knowledge and permission that all material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required in
connection with the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained and that in connection with obtaining any necessary governmental,
regulatory or other approvals and consents, no restrictions, terms or conditions will be imposed that would be material to our analysis. We
are not legal, regulatory, tax or accounting experts and have relied on the assessments made by the Company and its other advisors with
respect to such issues. Representatives of the Company have informed us, and we have further assumed with your knowledge and
permission, that the final terms of the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements will not differ materially from the terms set forth
in the drafts we have reviewed.

        This opinion has been approved and authorized for issuance by a Deutsche Bank fairness opinion review committee and is addressed
to, and is for the use and benefit of, the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the
Transaction. This opinion is limited to the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company
Common Stock (other than Parent and its affiliates and executive officers of the Company) as of the date hereof. This opinion does not
address any other terms of the Transaction, the Merger Agreement or any other agreement entered into or to be entered into in connection
with the Transaction. You have not asked us to, and this opinion does not, address the fairness of the

Transaction, or any consideration received in connection therewith, to the other holders of any securities, creditors or other constituencies
of the Company, nor does it address the fairness of the contemplated benefits of the Transaction. We express no opinion as to the merits of
the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any
alternative transactions or business strategies. Nor do we express an opinion, and this opinion does not constitute a recommendation, as to
how any holder of shares of Company Common Stock should vote with respect to the Transaction. In addition, we do not express any view
or opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or to be received by any of the
Company's officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction relative to the Merger
Consideration to be received by the holders of Company Common Stock.

        We were not requested to, and we did not, solicit third party indications of interest in the possible acquisition of all or part of the
Company, nor were we requested to consider, and our opinion does not address, the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any
alternative transactions or business strategies.

        Deutsche Bank will be paid a fee for its services as financial advisor to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which becomes payable upon delivery of this opinion (or would have become
payable if Deutsche Bank had advised the Board of Directors that it was unable to render this opinion) and a substantial portion of which
is contingent upon consummation of the Transaction. The Company has also agreed to reimburse Deutsche Bank for its expenses, and to
indemnify Deutsche Bank against certain liabilities, in connection with its engagement. We are an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG (together
with its affiliates, the "DB Group"). One or more members of the DB Group have, from time to time, provided, and are currently
providing, investment banking (including Parent's July 31, 2017 bond offering, for which a member of the DB Group served as joint
bookrunner), commercial banking (including extension of credit) and other financial services to Parent or its affiliates for which they have
received, and in the future may receive, compensation. The DB Group may also provide investment and commercial banking services to
Parent, the Company or their respective affiliates in the future, for which we would expect the DB Group to receive compensation. In the
ordinary course of business, members of the DB Group may actively trade in the securities and other instruments and obligations of
Parent, the Company and their respective affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. Accordingly, the DB
Group may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, instruments and obligations.

        Based upon and subject to the foregoing assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions, it is Deutsche Bank's opinion as
investment bankers that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company
Common Stock, excluding Parent and its affiliates and executive officers of the Company.

Very truly yours,

Annex F 

GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE 

§ 262 Appraisal rights 

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of
the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in
this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include
what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository
representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the
depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)
(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall
be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date
fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further
provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the
merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger
or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything
except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository
receipts in respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or
depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be
either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a.
and b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional
depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or
§ 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior

to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title,
appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set
forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the
words "merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or "surviving
or resulting corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in
which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of
incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance
with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this
section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice
a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each
stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the
vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if
it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A
stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the
effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each
constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or
consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within
10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to
appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by
§ 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be

sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to
demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or
consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to
appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a
second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is
sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this
title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending
of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has
demanded appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary
or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence
of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either
notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the
notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date
shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder
who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw
such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this
section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the
consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be
mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or
resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this
section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such
stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from
the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by
the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the
surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein

stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by
mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold
stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the
appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to
which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders
of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for
such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the
Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair
value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,
and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall
be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time
to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of
judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case
interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion,
proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose
name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted
such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is
finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated
stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates
representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such
surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal

proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against
the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided
in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective
date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in
subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such
stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the
right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery
shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this
section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been
converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or
resulting corporation.
