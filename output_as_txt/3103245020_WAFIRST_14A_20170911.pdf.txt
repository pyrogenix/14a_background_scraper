MERGER AND SHARE ISSUANCE PROPOSED — YOUR VOTE IS NEEDED

Dear Stockholder:

On May 15, 2017, Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation (which we refer to as “Sandy Spring”), WashingtonFirst
Bankshares, Inc., a Virginia corporation (which we refer to as “WashingtonFirst”), and Touchdown Acquisition, Inc., a Virginia
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sandy Spring (which we refer to as “Merger Sub”), entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (which we refer to as the “merger agreement”) that provides for the combination of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, (i) Merger Sub will merge with and into WashingtonFirst (which we refer to as the “first-step
merger”), with WashingtonFirst continuing as the surviving corporation in the first-step merger and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Sandy Spring, (ii) immediately following the completion of the first-step merger, WashingtonFirst will merge with and into Sandy
Spring (which we refer to as the “second-step merger” and, together with the first-step merger, the “integrated mergers”), with Sandy
Spring continuing as the surviving corporation in the second-step merger, and (iii) immediately following the completion of the
integrated mergers, WashingtonFirst Bank, a Virginia state-chartered bank and a wholly-owned subsidiary of WashingtonFirst, will
merge with and into Sandy Spring Bank, a Maryland state-chartered trust company with commercial banking powers and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Sandy Spring, with Sandy Spring Bank being the surviving bank (which we refer to as the “bank merger” and,
together with the integrated mergers, the “Transactions”).

At the effective time of the first-step merger, each outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
WashingtonFirst (which we refer to as “WashingtonFirst common stock”) and each share of WashingtonFirst Series A non-voting
common stock (which we refer to as the “WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock”), except for (i) specified shares of
WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock owned by WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring and
(ii) shares of WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock whose holders have validly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights
under Virginia law (which we collectively refer to as the “excluded shares”), will be converted into the right to receive 0.8713 shares
(such number being referred to as the “exchange ratio”) of the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Sandy Spring (which we
refer to as the “Sandy Spring common stock”), together with cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to adjustment if the volume-
weighted average price of Sandy Spring common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, for the twenty trading day period ending
on the fifth trading day before the day of completion of the first-step merger (which we refer to as the “Sandy Spring volume-weighted
average price”), is more than $50.15 or less than $37.07 per share. As a result, the number of shares of Sandy Spring common stock
that WashingtonFirst stockholders will receive in the merger may fluctuate with the market price of Sandy Spring common stock and
will not be known at the time that WashingtonFirst stockholders vote on the merger agreement. If the Sandy Spring volume-weighted
average price is less than $34.00, WashingtonFirst may terminate the merger agreement unless Sandy Spring adjusts the merger
consideration by either (i) increasing the exchange ratio to equal $32.30 divided by the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price or
(ii) adding a cash amount to bring the total value of the merger consideration to $32.30 per share. In this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, we refer to the number of shares of Sandy Spring common stock that a WashingtonFirst stockholder will receive
in the merger, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares, as the “merger consideration.”

On May 15, 2017, the last full trading day before the public announcement of the Transactions, the closing price of Sandy Spring
common stock was $42.72, and on August 31, 2017, the most recent trading day practicable before the printing of this proxy
statement/prospectus, the closing price of Sandy Spring common stock was $38.57. If $42.72 was the Sandy Spring volume-weighted
average price, WashingtonFirst stockholders would receive merger consideration of 0.8713 shares of Sandy Spring common stock for
each of their shares of WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock, and if $38.57 was the Sandy
Spring volume-weighted average price, WashingtonFirst stockholders would receive merger consideration of 0.8713 shares of Sandy
Spring common stock for each of their shares of WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock, in
each case with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. Based on an

Table of Contents

exchange ratio of 0.8713 and the number of shares of WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock
outstanding on August 31, 2017 (which includes the number of shares of WashingtonFirst common stock underlying WashingtonFirst’s
restricted stock awards as of August 31, 2017), the maximum number of shares of Sandy Spring common stock estimated to be
issuable at the effective time of the first-step merger is 11,398,870. We urge you to obtain current market quotations for Sandy
Spring (trading symbol “SASR”) and WashingtonFirst (trading symbol “WFBI”).

Sandy Spring will hold a special meeting of its stockholders (which we refer to as the “Sandy Spring special meeting”) in
connection with the issuance of the shares of Sandy Spring common stock representing the merger consideration (which we refer to as
the “Sandy Spring share issuance”). At the Sandy Spring special meeting, the holders of Sandy Spring common stock (which we refer
to as “Sandy Spring stockholders”) will be asked to vote to approve the Sandy Spring share issuance. Approval of the Sandy Spring
share issuance requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by the Sandy Spring stockholders at the Sandy Spring
special meeting.

WashingtonFirst will hold a special meeting of its stockholders (which we refer to as the “WashingtonFirst special meeting”) in
connection with the first-step merger. At the WashingtonFirst special meeting, the holders of WashingtonFirst common stock (which
we refer to as “WashingtonFirst stockholders”) will be asked to vote to approve the merger agreement and related matters as described
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Under Virginia law and WashingtonFirst’s organizational documents, approval of the merger
agreement requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by WashingtonFirst stockholders entitled to vote at the
WashingtonFirst special meeting.

The Sandy Spring special meeting will be held on October 18, 2017, at Sandy Spring’s corporate headquarters located at 17801
Georgia Avenue, Olney, Maryland 20832, at 9:00 a.m., local time. The WashingtonFirst special meeting will be held on October 18,
2017, at WashingtonFirst’s corporate headquarters located at 11921 Freedom Drive, Suite 250, Reston, Virginia 20190, at 10:00 a.m.,
local time.

The Sandy Spring board of directors unanimously recommends that Sandy Spring stockholders vote “FOR” the Sandy
Spring share issuance and “FOR” the adjournment of the Sandy Spring special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies in favor of the Sandy Spring share issuance.

The WashingtonFirst board of directors unanimously recommends that WashingtonFirst stockholders vote “FOR” the
approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the first-step merger, and “FOR” the
adjournment of the WashingtonFirst special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of the
approval of the merger agreement.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus describes the WashingtonFirst special meeting, the Sandy Spring special meeting, the
Transactions, the Sandy Spring share issuance, the documents related to the Transactions and other related matters. Please carefully
read this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 26, for a
discussion of the risks relating to the proposed merger and the Sandy Spring share issuance. You can also obtain information
about Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst from documents that each has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (which we
refer to as the “SEC”).

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

The following are some questions that you, as a Sandy Spring stockholder or a WashingtonFirst stockholder, may have about the
Transactions, the Sandy Spring share issuance, the Sandy Spring special meeting or the WashingtonFirst special meeting, as
applicable, and brief answers to those questions. We urge you to read carefully the remainder of this joint proxy statement/prospectus
because the information in this section does not provide all of the information that might be important to you with respect to the
Transactions, the Sandy Spring share issuance, the Sandy Spring special meeting or the WashingtonFirst special meeting, as
applicable. For details about where you can find additional important information, please see the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 150.

Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to “Sandy Spring” refer to Sandy Spring
Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and its subsidiaries, and references to “WashingtonFirst” refer to WashingtonFirst
Bankshares, Inc., a Virginia corporation, and its subsidiaries.

 
Q: What are the Transactions?
 

A: Sandy Spring, WashingtonFirst and Merger Sub entered into the merger agreement on May 15, 2017. The first-step merger is the
first step in a series of transactions to combine Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst, and their respective subsidiary banks, Sandy
Spring Bank and WashingtonFirst Bank.

Under the terms of the merger agreement:
 

 
•  Merger Sub will merge with and into WashingtonFirst, with WashingtonFirst continuing as the surviving corporation in such

merger and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sandy Spring (which we refer to as the “first-step merger”).
 

 
•  Immediately following the completion of the first-step merger, WashingtonFirst, as the surviving corporation in the first-step

merger, will merge with and into Sandy Spring, with Sandy Spring being the surviving corporation (which we refer to as the
“second-step merger” and, together with the first-step merger, the “integrated mergers”).

 

 
•  Immediately following the completion of the integrated mergers, WashingtonFirst Bank will merge with and into Sandy

Spring Bank, with Sandy Spring Bank being the surviving bank (which we refer to as the “bank merger,” and together with
the integrated mergers, the “Transactions”).

A copy of the merger agreement is included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

The integrated mergers cannot be completed unless, among other things:
 

 
•  The holders (which we refer to as the “Sandy Spring stockholders”) of the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of

Sandy Spring (which we refer to as the “Sandy Spring common stock”) approve the issuance of the shares of Sandy Spring
common stock in connection with the first-step merger (which we refer to as the “Sandy Spring share issuance”).

 

 

•  The holders (which we refer to as the “WashingtonFirst stockholders”) of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
WashingtonFirst (which we refer to as the “WashingtonFirst common stock”) approve the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the first-step merger (which we refer to as the “WashingtonFirst merger
proposal”).

The completion of the integrated mergers is subject to the fulfillment of additional customary conditions, which are discussed in
the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to Complete the Integrated
Mergers” beginning on page 109.

A: We are delivering this document to you because it is a joint proxy statement being used by both the Sandy Spring board of
directors (which we refer to as the “Sandy Spring board”) and the WashingtonFirst board of directors (which we refer to as the
“WashingtonFirst board”) to solicit proxies of the stockholders of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst, as applicable, in connection
with approval of the Sandy Spring share issuance and the first-step merger, as applicable, and related matters.

In order to approve the Sandy Spring share issuance, Sandy Spring has called a special meeting of the Sandy Spring stockholders
(which we refer to as the “Sandy Spring special meeting”). In order to approve the merger agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, including the first-step merger, WashingtonFirst has called a special meeting of the WashingtonFirst
stockholders (which we refer to as the “WashingtonFirst special meeting”). This document also serves as a notice of the Sandy
Spring special meeting and the WashingtonFirst special meeting, and describes the proposals to be presented at each special
meeting.

In addition, this document is also a prospectus that is being delivered to WashingtonFirst stockholders because Sandy Spring is
offering shares of Sandy Spring common stock to WashingtonFirst stockholders in connection with the first-step merger.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the Transactions. This document also contains
important information about the proposals being voted on at the Sandy Spring special meeting and the WashingtonFirst special
meeting, respectively. You should read this document carefully and in its entirety. The enclosed materials allow you to have your
shares voted by proxy without attending your special meeting. Your vote is important. We encourage you to submit your proxy
as soon as possible.

 
Q: In addition to the Sandy Spring share issuance, what else are Sandy Spring stockholders being asked to vote on at the

Sandy Spring special meeting?
 

A: In addition to voting on the Sandy Spring share issuance (which we refer to as the “Sandy Spring share issuance proposal”),
Sandy Spring is soliciting proxies from the Sandy Spring stockholders with respect to a proposal to adjourn the Sandy Spring
special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in favor of the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal
(which we refer to as the “Sandy Spring adjournment proposal”). Completion of the integrated mergers is not conditioned upon
approval of the Sandy Spring adjournment proposal.

 
Q: In addition to the approval of the merger agreement and the first-step merger, what else are WashingtonFirst stockholders

being asked to vote on at the WashingtonFirst special meeting?
 

A: In addition to voting on the WashingtonFirst merger proposal, WashingtonFirst is soliciting proxies from the WashingtonFirst
stockholders with respect to a proposal to adjourn the WashingtonFirst special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies in favor of the WashingtonFirst merger proposal (which we refer to as the “WashingtonFirst adjournment
proposal”). Completion of the integrated mergers is not conditioned upon approval of the WashingtonFirst adjournment proposal.

 
Q: What will WashingtonFirst stockholders be entitled to receive in the first-step merger?
 

A: If the first-step merger is completed, each outstanding share of WashingtonFirst common stock and each share of WashingtonFirst
non-voting common stock, except for (i) specified shares of WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst non-voting
common stock owned by WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring and (ii) shares of WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock whose
holders have validly exercised and

perfected their appraisal rights under Virginia law (which we collectively refer to as the “excluded shares”), will be converted into
the right to receive 0.8713 shares (such number being referred to as the “exchange ratio”) of Sandy Spring common stock,
together with cash in lieu of fractional shares, and subject to adjustment if the volume-weighted average price of Sandy Spring
common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, for the twenty trading day period ending on the fifth trading day before the
day of completion of the first-step merger (which we refer to as the “Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price”), is more than
$50.15 or less than $37.07 per share (which we refer to as the “merger consideration”). WashingtonFirst stockholders who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Sandy Spring common stock upon the completion of the first-step merger will
instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) based on the final exchange ratio.

 
Q: What will Sandy Spring stockholders be entitled to receive in the first-step merger?
 

A: Sandy Spring stockholders will not be entitled to receive any merger consideration and will continue to hold the shares of Sandy
Spring common stock that they held immediately prior to the completion of the first-step merger.

 
Q: How will the first-step merger affect WashingtonFirst equity awards?
 

A: The WashingtonFirst equity awards will be affected as follows:

Restricted Stock Awards: At the effective time of the first-step merger (which we refer to as the “effective time”), each restricted
stock award granted by WashingtonFirst will become fully vested and each holder of such restricted stock awards will be entitled
to receive the per share merger consideration for each share of WashingtonFirst common stock held by such holder.

Stock Options: Also at the effective time, all outstanding and unexercised options to purchase shares of WashingtonFirst common
stock will be canceled and will be cashed out for an amount equal to the value of the per share merger consideration less the
option exercise price, assuming for purposes of this calculation that all such options were 100% vested as of the effective time.
The value of the per share merger consideration for this purpose will be the exchange ratio multiplied by the Sandy Spring
volume-weighted average price.

 
Q: Will the value of the merger consideration change between the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the time

that the first-step merger is completed?
 

A: Perhaps. The value of the merger consideration may fluctuate between the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the
closing date because the market value for Sandy Spring common stock fluctuates.

 
Q: How does the Sandy Spring board recommend that I vote at the Sandy Spring special meeting?
 

A: The Sandy Spring board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal and “FOR” the
Sandy Spring adjournment proposal.

 
Q: How does the WashingtonFirst board recommend that I vote at the WashingtonFirst special meeting?
 

A: The WashingtonFirst board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the WashingtonFirst merger proposal and “FOR” the
WashingtonFirst adjournment proposal.

 
Q: When and where are the meetings?
 

A: The Sandy Spring special meeting will be held at Sandy Spring’s corporate headquarters located at 17801 Georgia Avenue, Olney,
Maryland 20832 on October 18, 2017, at 9:00 a.m., local time.

The WashingtonFirst special meeting will be held at WashingtonFirst’s corporate headquarters located at 11921 Freedom Drive,
Suite 250, Reston, Virginia 20190 on October 18, 2017, at 10:00 a.m., local time.

Q: What do I need to do now?
 

A: Please carefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. After you have carefully read this joint proxy statement/prospectus and have decided how you wish to vote
your shares, please vote your shares promptly as described under “— Q: How do I vote?” immediately below. In order to assure
that your shares are represented and voted at your special meeting, please submit your proxy as instructed on the accompanying
proxy card even if you currently plan to attend your special meeting in person.

 
Q: How do I vote?
 

A: You may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” on any proposal. The procedures for voting are as follows:

Voting by Proxy:

If you hold your shares in your name as a stockholder of record, you may vote by mail, through the Internet or by telephone.
 

 
•  To vote by mail, you must complete, sign, date and mail your proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid return envelope as

soon as possible. Please respond promptly to ensure your proxy card is mailed sufficiently in advance to ensure receipt prior
to your special meeting.

 

 
•  To vote through the Internet, please follow the instructions on the accompanying proxy card as soon as possible. The

instructions in the enclosed proxy card contain the applicable deadlines and other information about voting your shares
through the Internet.

 

 
•  To vote by telephone, please follow the instructions on the accompanying proxy card as soon as possible. The instructions in

the enclosed proxy card contain the applicable deadlines and other information about voting your shares by telephone.

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a bank or broker, you must direct your bank or broker how to vote in accordance
with the instructions you have received or will receive from your bank or broker.

If your special meeting is postponed or adjourned for any reason, at any subsequent reconvening of your special meeting all
proxies will be voted in the same manner as the proxies would have been voted at the original convening of your special meeting,
except for any proxies that have at that time effectively been revoked or withdrawn, even if the proxies had been effectively voted
on the same or any other matter at a previous meeting.

Voting in Person at Your Special Meeting:

If you hold your shares in your name as a stockholder of record and wish to attend your special meeting and vote in person, you
may request a ballot when you arrive. “Street name” stockholders who wish to vote in person at their special meeting will need to
obtain a legal proxy from the institution that holds their shares.

 
Q: What constitutes a quorum for the Sandy Spring special meeting?
 

A: The presence at the Sandy Spring special meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders representing at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Sandy Spring common stock entitled to be voted at the Sandy Spring special meeting will constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business at the Sandy Spring special meeting. Once a share is represented for any purpose at the
Sandy Spring special meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the Sandy Spring special meeting or
for any adjournment(s) thereof. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will be included in determining the number of shares
present at the meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

•  Standard: Approval of the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes

cast by the holders of Sandy Spring common stock at the Sandy Spring special meeting.
 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy, fail to submit a proxy or fail to vote in

person at the Sandy Spring special meeting, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the Sandy
Spring share issuance proposal, it will have no effect on the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal.

cast by the holders of Sandy Spring common stock at the Sandy Spring special meeting.

Table of Contents

Q: Why is my vote important?
 

A: If you do not vote, it will be more difficult for Sandy Spring or WashingtonFirst to obtain the necessary quorum to hold their
respective special meetings. If you are a Sandy Spring stockholder, your failure to submit a proxy or vote in person, or failure to
instruct your bank or broker how to vote, or abstention with respect to the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal will not be
counted as a vote cast and will have no effect on the approval of such proposal, even though such approval is a condition to the
completion of the integrated mergers. If you are a WashingtonFirst stockholder, your failure to submit a proxy or vote in person,
or failure to instruct your bank or broker how to vote, or abstention with respect to the WashingtonFirst merger proposal will have
the same effect as a vote against the proposal, even though such approval is a condition to the completion of the integrated
mergers. The Sandy Spring share issuance must be approved by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the total votes cast by
the Sandy Spring stockholders at the Sandy Spring special meeting. The merger agreement must be approved by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of WashingtonFirst common stock entitled to vote at the WashingtonFirst special
meeting. The Sandy Spring board unanimously recommends that the Sandy Spring stockholders vote “FOR” the Sandy Spring
share issuance proposal and the WashingtonFirst board unanimously recommends that the WashingtonFirst stockholders vote
“FOR” the WashingtonFirst merger proposal.

 
Q: If my shares of common stock are held in “street name” by my bank or broker, will my bank or broker automatically vote

my shares for me?
 

A: No. Your bank or broker cannot vote your shares without instructions from you. You should instruct your bank or broker how to
vote your shares in accordance with the instructions provided to you. Please check the voting form used by your bank or broker.

 
Q: Can I attend the meeting and vote my shares in person?
 

A: Yes. All stockholders of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst, including stockholders of record and stockholders who hold their
shares “in street name” through banks, brokers, nominees or any other holder of record, are invited to attend their respective
meetings. Holders of record of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst common stock can vote in person at the Sandy Spring special
meeting and WashingtonFirst special meeting, respectively. If you are not a stockholder of record, you must obtain a proxy,
executed in your favor, from the record holder of your shares, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, to be able to vote in person
at your meeting. If you plan to attend your special meeting, you must hold your shares in your own name or have a letter from the
record holder of your shares confirming your ownership. In addition, you must bring a form of personal photo identification with
you in order to be admitted. Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst reserve the right to refuse admittance to anyone without proper
proof of share ownership or without proper photo identification. The use of cameras, sound recording equipment, communications
devices or any similar equipment during the special meetings is prohibited without Sandy Spring’s or WashingtonFirst’s express
written consent, respectively.

 
Q: Can I change my vote?
 

A: Sandy Spring stockholders: Yes. If you are a holder of record of Sandy Spring common stock, you may change your vote or
revoke any proxy at any time before it is voted by (i) signing and returning a proxy card with a later date, (ii) delivering a written
revocation letter to Sandy Spring’s corporate secretary, (iii) attending the Sandy Spring special meeting in person, notifying the
corporate secretary and voting by ballot at the Sandy Spring special meeting or (iv) voting through the Internet or by telephone at
a later time. Attendance at the Sandy Spring special meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy. A revocation or later-dated
proxy received by Sandy Spring after the vote will not affect the vote. Sandy Spring’s corporate secretary’s mailing address is:
Corporate Secretary, 17801 Georgia Avenue, Olney, Maryland 20832.

WashingtonFirst stockholders: Yes. If you are a holder of record of WashingtonFirst common stock, you may change your vote or
revoke any proxy at any time before it is voted by (i) signing and returning a proxy with a later date, (ii) delivering a written
revocation letter to WashingtonFirst’s corporate secretary, (iii) attending the WashingtonFirst special meeting in person, notifying
the corporate secretary and voting by ballot at the WashingtonFirst special meeting or (iv) voting through the Internet or by
telephone at a later time. Attendance at the WashingtonFirst special meeting by itself will not automatically revoke your proxy. A
revocation or later-dated proxy received by WashingtonFirst after the vote will not affect the vote. WashingtonFirst’s corporate
secretary’s mailing address is: Corporate Secretary, 11921 Freedom Drive, Reston, Virginia 20190.

If you hold your shares of Sandy Spring common stock or WashingtonFirst common stock in “street name” through a bank or
broker, you should contact your bank or broker to change your vote or revoke your proxy.

 
Q: Will Sandy Spring be required to submit the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal to its stockholders even if the Sandy

Spring board has withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation?
 

A: No, Sandy Spring will not be required to submit the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal to its stockholders if the Sandy Spring
board has withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation.

 
Q: Will WashingtonFirst be required to submit the WashingtonFirst merger proposal to its stockholders even if the

WashingtonFirst board has withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation?
 

A: No, WashingtonFirst will not be required to submit the WashingtonFirst merger proposal to its stockholders if the WashingtonFirst
board has withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation.

 
Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the integrated mergers to WashingtonFirst stockholders?
 

A: The obligations of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring to complete the integrated mergers are subject to, among other customary
closing conditions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the receipt by each of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring of
the opinion of its counsel to the effect that the integrated mergers together will be treated as an integrated transaction that qualifies
as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which we refer to
as the “Code”). Assuming that the integrated mergers qualify as a reorganization under the Code, holders of WashingtonFirst
common stock generally will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on the exchange of shares of
WashingtonFirst common stock for shares of Sandy Spring common stock, except with respect to any cash received instead of
fractional shares of Sandy Spring common stock.

You should read the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Integrated Mergers” beginning on page 116 for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
integrated mergers. Tax matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the integrated mergers to you will depend on
your particular tax situation. You should consult your tax advisor to determine the tax consequences of the integrated mergers to
you.

 
Q: Are WashingtonFirst stockholders entitled to dissenters’ rights?
 

A: Holders of shares WashingtonFirst common stock are not entitled to exercise dissenters’ rights in connection with the
WashingtonFirst merger proposal. However, holders, of shares of WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock are entitled to
exercise dissenters’ rights in connection with the WashingtonFirst merger proposal. For further information, see “The
Transactions — Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 92.

Q: If I am a WashingtonFirst stockholder, should I send in my WashingtonFirst stock certificates now?
 

A: No. Please do not send in your WashingtonFirst stock certificates with your proxy. Promptly following the completion of the first-
step merger, an exchange agent will send you instructions for exchanging WashingtonFirst stock certificates for the merger
consideration. See “The Merger Agreement — Conversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates” beginning on page 97.

 
Q: What should I do if I hold my shares of WashingtonFirst common stock in book-entry form?
 

A: You are not required to take any special additional actions if your shares of WashingtonFirst common stock are held in book-entry
form. Promptly following the completion of the first-step merger, shares of WashingtonFirst common stock held in book-entry
form automatically will be exchanged for shares of Sandy Spring common stock in book-entry form and cash to be paid in
exchange for fractional shares, if any.

 
Q: Whom may I contact if I cannot locate my WashingtonFirst stock certificate(s)?
 

A: If you are unable to locate your original WashingtonFirst stock certificate(s), you should contact Computershare Investor
Services, WashingtonFirst’s transfer agent, at (800) 368-5948 or P.O. Box 43078, Providence, Rhode Island 02940-3078.

 
Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 

A: Sandy Spring stockholders and WashingtonFirst stockholders may receive more than one set of voting materials, including
multiple copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you
hold shares of Sandy Spring and/or WashingtonFirst common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a
separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold such shares. If you are a holder of record of Sandy
Spring common stock or WashingtonFirst common stock and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive
more than one proxy card. In addition, if you are a holder of both Sandy Spring common stock and WashingtonFirst common
stock, you will receive one or more separate proxy cards or voting instruction cards for each company. Please complete, sign, date
and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive or otherwise follow the voting instructions set forth in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus to ensure that you vote every share of Sandy Spring common stock and/or WashingtonFirst
common stock that you own.

 
Q: When do you expect to complete the Transactions?
 

A: Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst currently expect to complete the Transactions in the fourth quarter of 2017. However, neither
Sandy Spring nor WashingtonFirst can assure you of when, or if, the Transactions will be completed. The completion of the
integrated mergers is subject to the fulfillment of customary closing conditions, including the approval by the Sandy Spring
stockholders of the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal, the approval by the WashingtonFirst stockholders of the
WashingtonFirst merger proposal and the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.

 
Q: What happens if the first-step merger is not completed?
 

A: If the first-step merger is not completed, WashingtonFirst stockholders will not receive any consideration for their shares in
connection with the first-step merger. Instead, WashingtonFirst will remain an independent publicly traded company and its
common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, if the merger agreement is
terminated in certain circumstances, a termination fee may be required to be paid by either Sandy Spring or WashingtonFirst. For

In the First-Step Merger, WashingtonFirst Stockholders will be Entitled to Receive the Merger Consideration (page 95)

Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst are proposing a strategic merger. If the first-step merger is completed, each outstanding
share of WashingtonFirst common stock, except for the excluded shares, will be converted into the right to receive a number of
shares of Sandy Spring common stock based on the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price. Specifically, at the effective
time of the first-step merger, each share of WashingtonFirst common stock and each share of WashingtonFirst non-voting common
stock, except for the excluded shares, will be converted into shares of Sandy Spring common stock as follows:
 

 •  if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is greater than $53.23, the exchange ratio will equal 0.8210;
 

 
•  if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is greater than $50.15 and equal to or less than $53.23, the exchange

ratio will equal the quotient of $43.70 divided by the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price;
 

 
•  if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is equal to or greater than $37.07 and equal to or less than $50.15,

the exchange ratio will equal 0.8713;
 

 
•  if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is equal to or greater than $34.00 and less than $37.07, the exchange

ratio will equal the quotient of $32.30 divided by the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price; and
 

 •  if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is less than $34.00, the exchange ratio will equal 0.9500.

Table of Contents

The following table illustrates the value of the merger consideration based on the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average
price. Because the market value of Sandy Spring common stock will fluctuate, the value of the merger consideration may have a
value as of the date the WashingtonFirst stockholders receive their shares that is less than, or greater than, the value of merger
consideration on the date that the exchange ratio is determined.

Sandy Spring will not issue any fractional shares of Sandy Spring common stock in the first-step merger. WashingtonFirst
stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Sandy Spring common stock upon the completion
of the first-step merger will instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent, determined by
multiplying the fraction of a share of Sandy Spring common stock to which the holder would otherwise be entitled by the Sandy
Spring volume-weighted average price.

What Holders of WashingtonFirst Equity-Based Awards will be Entitled to Receive (page 87)

The WashingtonFirst equity awards will be affected as follows:

Restricted Stock Awards: At the effective time, each restricted stock award granted by WashingtonFirst will become fully
vested and each holder of such restricted stock awards will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration for each share
of WashingtonFirst common stock held by such holder.

Stock Options: Also at the effective time, all outstanding and unexercised options to purchase shares of WashingtonFirst
common stock will be canceled and will be cashed out for an amount equal to the value of the per share merger consideration less
the option exercise price, assuming for purposes of this calculation that all such options were 100% vested as of the effective time.
The value of the per share merger consideration for this purpose will be the exchange ratio multiplied by the Sandy Spring
volume-weighted average price.

Spring stockholders at the Sandy Spring special meeting. If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy, fail to submit a proxy or fail to

the “WashingtonFirst record date”), will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the WashingtonFirst special meeting. Each share of
WashingtonFirst common stock is entitled to one vote on each proposal to be considered at the WashingtonFirst special meeting.

WashingtonFirst special meeting are voted in favor of such proposal at the WashingtonFirst special meeting. If you mark
“ABSTAIN” on your proxy, fail to submit a proxy or fail to vote in person at the WashingtonFirst special meeting or fail to instruct

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Integrated Mergers (page 116)

The obligations of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring to complete the integrated mergers are subject to, among other
customary closing conditions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the receipt by each of WashingtonFirst and Sandy
Spring of the opinion of its counsel to the effect that the integrated mergers together will be treated as an integrated transaction that
qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Assuming that the integrated mergers qualify as
a reorganization, holders of WashingtonFirst common stock generally will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income
tax purposes on the exchange of shares of WashingtonFirst common stock for shares of Sandy Spring common stock, except with
respect to any cash received instead of fractional shares of Sandy Spring common stock.

Certain WashingtonFirst Directors and Executive Officers Have Financial Interests in the Transactions that Differ from
Your Interests (page 87)

In considering the recommendation of the WashingtonFirst board to adopt the merger agreement, WashingtonFirst
stockholders should be aware that certain directors and executive officers of WashingtonFirst have employment and other
compensation agreements or plans that give them interests in the Transactions that are different from, or in addition to, their
interests as WashingtonFirst stockholders. The WashingtonFirst board was aware of these circumstances at the time it approved the
merger agreement. These interests include:
 

 

•  The awards of stock options that WashingtonFirst has made to its executive officers and directors under its equity
incentive plan. As a result of the first-step merger, each stock option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the closing will be canceled and will be cashed out for an amount equal to the value of
the per share merger consideration less the option exercise price, assuming for purposes of this calculation that all such
options were 100% vested as of the effective time. The value of the per share merger consideration for this purpose will
be the exchange ratio multiplied by the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price;

 

 

•  The awards of restricted stock that WashingtonFirst has made to its executive officers and directors under its equity
incentive plans. As a result of the first-step merger, each restricted stock award that is outstanding immediately prior to
closing will fully vest and each holder will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration for each share of
WashingtonFirst common stock held by such holder;

 

 

•  The employment agreements with Shaza L. Andersen, President and Chief Executive Officer of WashingtonFirst Bank,
and Michael J. Rebibo, Executive Vice President of WashingtonFirst Bank and President of 1st Portfolio Wealth
Advisors and WashingtonFirst Mortgage, which provide for a cash severance payment (and, for Ms. Andersen, payment
of premiums for continued health benefits for 12 months) in the event of a termination of employment without cause
following a change in control;

 

 

•  The severance payment agreements with George W. Connors, IV, President and Chief Credit Officer of WashingtonFirst
Bank, Richard D. Horn, General Counsel of WashingtonFirst Bank, and Matthew R. Johnson, Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer of WashingtonFirst Bank, which provide for a cash severance payment and payment of
COBRA costs for continued health benefits for up to 12 months in the event of a termination of employment without
cause following a change in control;

 

 

•  The supplemental executive retirement agreements with Shaza L. Andersen, George W. Connors, IV, Richard D. Horn,
Matthew R. Johnson, and Joseph S. Bracewell, Chairman of the Board of WashingtonFirst, which provide each
executive with a vested benefit upon a separation from service following a change in control of WashingtonFirst or
WashingtonFirst Bank; and

 

 

•  That, pursuant to the merger agreement, Shaza L. Andersen, Joseph S. Bracewell and two additional members of
WashingtonFirst’s board of directors are to be appointed as members of the Sandy Spring and Sandy Spring Bank boards
of directors and Shaza L. Andersen and Joseph S. Bracewell are to be appointed to the executive committee of the Sandy
Spring board.

It is anticipated that Ms. Andersen will enter into a consulting and separation agreement with Sandy Spring that will set forth
Ms. Andersen’s entitlements and continuing obligations in connection with her termination of employment with WashingtonFirst
and WashingtonFirst Bank following the effective time of the first-step merger and her service as a non-employee director of and
consultant to Sandy Spring. It is also anticipated that

Mr. Connors will negotiate and enter into a bonus award and release agreement that will provide for certain payments in lieu of the
lump sum cash payment under his severance payment agreement and an employment agreement with Sandy Spring that will set
forth his new position at Sandy Spring following the effective time of the first-step merger. All arrangements entered into with
Sandy Spring will be effective as of the effective time of the first-step merger.

Holders of WashingtonFirst Common Stock Are NOT Entitled to Assert Dissenters’ Rights (page 92)

Under the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, the holders of WashingtonFirst common stock will not have any dissenters’ rights
with respect to the WashingtonFirst merger proposal. However, the holders of shares of WashingtonFirst non-voting common
stock will have dissenters’ rights with respect to the WashingtonFirst merger proposal. For further information, see “The
Transactions — Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 92.

Completion of the Transactions; Conditions That Must Be Fulfilled For the Integrated Mergers To Occur (page 109)

Currently, WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring expect to complete the Transactions in the fourth quarter of 2017. As more
fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreement, the completion of the integrated mergers
depends on a number of customary closing conditions being satisfied or, where legally permissible, waived. These conditions
include:
 

 
•  approval of the merger agreement by the WashingtonFirst stockholders and approval of the issuance of shares of Sandy

Spring common stock in connection with the first-step merger by Sandy Spring stockholders;
 

 
•  authorization for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market of the shares of Sandy Spring common stock to be issued in

the first-step merger;
 

 

•  the receipt of required regulatory approval, including the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (which we refer to as the “Federal Reserve Board”), the Maryland Office of the Commissioner of Financial
Regulation and the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions, and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods and the
absence of any materially burdensome conditions on any regulatory approvals;

 

 •  the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part;
 

 
•  the absence of any order, injunction or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the integrated mergers or

making the completion of the integrated mergers illegal;
 

 
•  subject to the materiality standards provided in the merger agreement, the accuracy of the representations and warranties

of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst in the merger agreement;
 

 
•  performance in all material respects by each of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst of its obligations under the merger

agreement; and
 

 •  receipt by each of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst of an opinion from its counsel as to certain tax matters.

Neither WashingtonFirst nor Sandy Spring can be certain when, or if, the conditions to the integrated mergers will be
satisfied or waived, or that the integrated mergers will be completed.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 110)

The merger agreement can be terminated at any time prior to the completion of the first-step merger in the following
circumstances:
 

 •  by mutual written consent, if Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst so determine;

•  by either Sandy Spring or WashingtonFirst, if the required vote of WashingtonFirst stockholders needed to approve the

merger agreement or the required vote of Sandy Spring stockholders needed to approve the Sandy Spring share issuance
is not received;

 

 

•  by either Sandy Spring or WashingtonFirst, if (i) any governmental entity denies any requisite regulatory approval in
connection with the Transactions and such denial has become final and non-appealable, or (ii) any governmental entity
of competent jurisdiction has issued a final and non-appealable order prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, unless the failure to obtain a requisite regulatory approval is due
to the failure of the terminating party to perform or observe its obligations under the merger agreement;

 

 

•  by either Sandy Spring or WashingtonFirst, if the integrated mergers have not been consummated on or before May 15,
2018, the one year anniversary of the date of the merger agreement (which we refer to as the “termination date”), unless
the failure of the integrated mergers to be consummated by such date is due to the failure of the terminating party to
perform or observe its obligations under the merger agreement;

 

 

•  by either Sandy Spring or WashingtonFirst (except that the terminating party cannot then be in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement), if the other party breaches
any of its obligations or any of its representations and warranties set forth in the merger agreement (or any such
representation or warranty ceases to be true) which either individually or in the aggregate would constitute, if occurring
or continuing on the closing date, the failure of a closing condition of the terminating party and such breach is not cured
within 30 days following written notice to the party committing such breach, or such breach cannot be cured during such
period;

 

 

•  by WashingtonFirst, prior to the time that the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal is approved, if the Sandy Spring
board (i) fails to recommend in this joint proxy statement/prospectus that the Sandy Spring stockholders approve the
Sandy Spring share issuance, or takes certain adverse actions with respect to such recommendation, or (ii) breaches
certain obligations, including with respect to calling a meeting of its stockholders and recommending that they approve
the Sandy Spring share issuance, in any material respect;

 

 

•  by Sandy Spring, prior to the time that the WashingtonFirst merger proposal is approved, if the WashingtonFirst board
(i) fails to recommend in this joint proxy statement/prospectus that the WashingtonFirst stockholders approve the merger
agreement, or takes certain adverse actions with respect to such recommendation, (ii) fails to recommend against
acceptance of a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding WashingtonFirst common stock that has been publicly
disclosed (other than by Sandy Spring or an affiliate of Sandy Spring) within 10 business days after the commencement
of such tender or exchange offer, (iii) recommends or endorses an alternative acquisition proposal, or (iv) breaches
certain obligations, including with respect to alternative acquisition proposals or calling a meeting of its stockholders
and recommending that they approve the merger agreement, in any material respect; or

 

 

•  by WashingtonFirst, if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is less than $34.00, subject to Sandy Spring’s
right to adjust the merger consideration by either (i) increasing the exchange ratio to equal $32.30 divided by the Sandy
Spring volume-weighted average price or (ii) adding a cash amount to bring the total value of the merger consideration
to $32.30 per share.

WashingtonFirst board or changes in the recommendation of the Sandy Spring board, WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring, as
applicable, may be required to pay to the other party a termination fee equal to $18.5 million (which we refer to as the
“termination fee”). The termination fee could discourage other companies from seeking to acquire or merge with WashingtonFirst
or Sandy Spring.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Integrated Mergers and the Bank Merger (page 93)

Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, both WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring have agreed to cooperate with each
other and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals or waivers necessary or advisable to complete the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These include approvals from the Federal Reserve Board, the Maryland
Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation and the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions. Sandy Spring submitted
applications to the Federal Reserve Board on June 29, 2017 and to the Maryland Office of the Commissioner of Financial
Regulation and the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions on July 5, 2017. As of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions has approved the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and the remainder of these applications remain outstanding. Although neither Sandy Spring nor WashingtonFirst knows
of any reason why the applications should not be approved in a timely manner, Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst cannot be
certain when, or if, the applications will be approved.

The Rights of WashingtonFirst Stockholders Will Change as a Result of the First-Step Merger (page 131)

Sandy Spring is incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland and WashingtonFirst is incorporated under the laws of
the Commonwealth of Virginia. Accordingly, Maryland law governs the Sandy Spring stockholders and Virginia law governs the
WashingtonFirst stockholders. As a result of the first-step merger, WashingtonFirst stockholders will become stockholders of
Sandy Spring. Thus, following the completion of the first-step merger, the rights of WashingtonFirst stockholders who become
Sandy Spring stockholders in the first-step merger will be governed by the corporate law of the State of Maryland and will also
then be governed by Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation and bylaws, rather than by the corporate law of the Commonwealth
of Virginia and WashingtonFirst’s articles of incorporation and bylaws.

See “Comparison of Stockholders’ Rights” for a description of the material differences in stockholders’ rights under the laws
of the State of Maryland, the Commonwealth of Virginia and each of the Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst governing documents.

services through its subsidiary, 1st Portfolio Wealth Advisors, and mortgage banking services through WashingtonFirst Bank’s
subsidiary, WashingtonFirst Mortgage Corporation.

WashingtonFirst’s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “WFBI.”

WashingtonFirst’s principal executive office is located at 11921 Freedom Drive, Suite 250, Reston, Virginia 20190 and its
telephone number at that location is (703) 840-2410. Additional information about WashingtonFirst and its subsidiaries is included
in documents incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 150.

Litigation Related to the Transactions

On August 1, 2017, Paul Parshall, a purported stockholder of WashingtonFirst, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against WashingtonFirst, the members of the WashingtonFirst
board and Sandy Spring on behalf of all WashingtonFirst public stockholders. The lawsuit alleges that Sandy Spring’s registration
statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, omitted certain material information, which
rendered the registration statement false and misleading. The relief sought in the lawsuit includes preliminary and permanent
injunction against the consummation of the Transactions, rescission or rescissory damages if the Transactions are completed, costs
and attorney’s fees. The defendants believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against the suit vigorously.
However, at this time, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the lawsuit or the impact on Sandy Spring, WashingtonFirst or
the Transactions.

SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL DATA

The following table shows selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data about the financial condition and
results of operations of Sandy Spring giving effect to the Transactions.

With respect to the Transactions, the selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information assumes that
the Transactions will be accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting with Sandy Spring treated as the acquirer.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the identifiable assets and identifiable liabilities of WashingtonFirst, as of the
effective date of the Transactions, will be recorded by Sandy Spring at their respective estimated fair values and the excess of the
merger consideration over the estimated fair value of WashingtonFirst’s net identifiable assets will be allocated to goodwill.

The pro forma financial condition data set forth in the table below assumes that the Transactions became effective on June
30, 2017. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statements for the periods ending December 31,
2016 and June 30, 2017 present the pro forma results of operations of Sandy Spring giving effect to the Transactions assuming that
the Transactions became effective on January 1, 2016.

The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data has been derived from and should be read in
conjunction with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, including the notes thereto, which is
included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus under the section entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Statements.” The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data is presented for illustrative purposes only and
does not necessarily indicate the financial results of the combined companies had the companies actually been combined at the
beginning of the periods presented. The selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data also does not consider
any potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues, potential revenue enhancements, anticipated cost savings and
expense efficiencies, or asset dispositions, among other factors. Further, as explained in more detail in the notes accompanying the
more detailed unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included under “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Statements” beginning on page 121, the pro forma allocation of purchase price reflected in the selected
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is subject to adjustment and may vary from the actual purchase
price allocation that will be recorded at the time the Transactions are completed. Additionally, the adjustments made in the
unaudited pro forma condensed financial information, which are described in those notes, are preliminary and may be revised.

UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE DATA

Presented below for Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst is historical, unaudited pro forma combined and pro forma equivalent
per share financial data. The information presented below should be read together with the historical consolidated financial
statements of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst, including the related notes, filed with the SEC and incorporated by reference
into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information.” The unaudited pro forma combined and
pro forma equivalent per share information gives effect to the Transactions as if they had been effective on June 30, 2017 in the
case of the book value data, and as if the Transactions had been effective as of the beginning of the periods presented in the case of
the earnings per share and the cash dividends data. The unaudited pro forma earnings per share data combines the historical results
of WashingtonFirst into Sandy Spring’s consolidated statement of income. While certain adjustments to the book value data were
made for the estimated impact of fair value adjustments and other acquisition-related activity, they are not indicative of what could
have occurred had the acquisition taken place as of the beginning of the period presented. In addition, the unaudited pro forma data
includes adjustments that are preliminary and may be revised. The unaudited pro forma data, while helpful in illustrating the
financial characteristics of the combined company under one set of assumptions, does not reflect the impact of factors that may
result as a consequence of the Transactions or consider any potential impacts of current market conditions or the Transactions on
revenues, expense efficiencies, asset dispositions and share repurchases, among other factors, nor the impact of possible business
model changes. As a result, unaudited pro forma data is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not represent an attempt
to predict or suggest future results.

RISK FACTORS

In addition to general investment risks and the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed under the section “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements” beginning on page 32 you should carefully consider the following risk factors in deciding how to vote for the proposals
presented in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You should also consider the other information in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and the other documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See the section of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 150.

Because the market price of Sandy Spring common stock may fluctuate, WashingtonFirst stockholders cannot be certain of the
precise value of the merger consideration they will be entitled to receive.

Upon completion of the first-step merger, each outstanding share of WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst non-
voting common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.8713 of a share of Sandy Spring common stock, together with cash in
lieu of fractional shares, subject to adjustment if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is more than $50.15 or less than
$37.07 per share. There will be a lapse of time between each of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the date of the Sandy
Spring special meeting, the date of the WashingtonFirst special meeting and the date on which WashingtonFirst stockholders entitled to
receive the merger consideration actually receive the merger consideration. The market value of Sandy Spring common stock may
fluctuate during these periods as a result of a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in Sandy
Spring’s businesses, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are outside of the control of Sandy
Spring and WashingtonFirst. Consequently, at the time WashingtonFirst stockholders must decide whether to approve the merger
agreement, they will not know the actual market value of the shares of Sandy Spring common stock they may receive when the first-
step merger is completed. The value of the merger consideration will depend on the market value of shares of Sandy Spring common
stock on the date the merger consideration is received. This value will not be known at the time of the WashingtonFirst special meeting
and may be more or less than the current price of Sandy Spring common stock or the price of Sandy Spring common stock at the time
of the WashingtonFirst special meeting.

The market price of Sandy Spring common stock after the first-step merger is completed may be affected by factors different from
those affecting the market price of WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring common stock currently.

Upon completion of the first-step merger, WashingtonFirst stockholders will become Sandy Spring stockholders. Sandy Spring’s
business differs in important respects from that of WashingtonFirst, and, accordingly, the results of operations of the combined
company and the market price of Sandy Spring common stock after the completion of the first-step merger may be affected by factors
different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst. For a
discussion of the businesses of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst and of some important factors to consider in connection with those
businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and referred to under “Where You
Can Find More Information” beginning on page 150.

Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently
anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Transactions.

Before the Transactions can be completed, Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst must obtain approvals from the Federal Reserve
Board, the Maryland Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation and the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions. Sandy
Spring submitted applications to the Federal Reserve Board on June 29, 2017 and to the Maryland Office of the Commissioner of
Financial Regulation and the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions on July 5, 2017. As of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions has approved the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and the remainder

of these applications remain outstanding. In determining whether to approve these applications, the regulatory agencies consider a
variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party and the factors described under the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Transactions —Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transactions” beginning on page 93. An
adverse development in either party’s regulatory standing or these factors could result in an inability to obtain approval or delay their
receipt. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the Transactions or require changes to the terms of the
Transactions. Such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the Transactions or imposing
additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the completion of the Transactions, any of which
might have an adverse effect on the combined company following the completion of the Transactions. For more information, see the
section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Transactions — Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transactions”
beginning on page 93.

Combining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost
savings of the Transactions may not be realized.

Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst have operated and, until the completion of the Transactions, will continue to operate,
independently. The success of the Transactions, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on Sandy Spring’s
ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst in a manner that permits growth
opportunities and does not materially disrupt existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is
possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company’s ongoing businesses or
inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain
relationships with clients, customers, depositors, employees and other constituents or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost
savings of the Transactions. The loss of key employees could adversely affect Sandy Spring’s ability to successfully conduct its
business, which could have an adverse effect on Sandy Spring’s financial results and the value of its common stock. If Sandy Spring
experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Transactions may not be realized fully or at all, or
may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause
Sandy Spring and/or WashingtonFirst to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from Sandy Spring and/or
WashingtonFirst and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts between the two companies will also
divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of WashingtonFirst and
Sandy Spring during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the Transactions on the combined
company. In addition, the actual cost savings of the Transactions could be less than anticipated.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in this document are preliminary. The actual financial
condition and results of operations of Sandy Spring after the completion of the Transactions may differ materially.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements in this joint proxy statement/prospectus are presented for
illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what Sandy Spring’s actual financial condition or results of operations
would have been had the Transactions been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements reflect adjustments to illustrate the effect of the Transactions had they been completed on the dates indicated. Such
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are based upon preliminary estimates to record the WashingtonFirst
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The purchase price allocation for
the first-step merger reflected in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is preliminary, and final allocation of the purchase price will be
based upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable assets and identifiable liabilities of WashingtonFirst as of the
date of the completion of the Transactions. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may differ materially from the
pro forma adjustments reflected in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. For more information, see the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements” beginning on page 121.

Certain WashingtonFirst directors and executive officers have interests in the Transactions that may differ from the interests of
WashingtonFirst stockholders.

The WashingtonFirst stockholders should be aware that certain WashingtonFirst directors and executive officers have interests in
the Transactions and have arrangements that are different from, or in addition to, those of WashingtonFirst stockholders generally. The
WashingtonFirst board was aware of these interests and considered these interests, among other matters, when making its decision to
approve the merger agreement, and in recommending that WashingtonFirst stockholders vote in favor of the WashingtonFirst merger
proposal and certain related matters and against alternative transactions.

The material interests considered by the WashingtonFirst board were as follows:
 

 

•  The awards of stock options that WashingtonFirst has made to its executive officers and directors under its equity incentive
plan. As a result of the first-step merger, each stock option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the closing will be canceled and will be cashed out for an amount equal to the value of the per share
merger consideration less the option exercise price, assuming for purposes of this calculation that all such options were
100% vested as of the effective time. The value of the per share merger consideration for this purpose will be the exchange
ratio multiplied by the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price;

 

 

•  The awards of restricted stock that WashingtonFirst has made to its executive officers and directors under its equity
incentive plans. As a result of the first-step merger, each restricted stock award that is outstanding immediately prior to
closing will fully vest and each holder will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration for each share of
WashingtonFirst common stock held by such holder;

 

 

•  The employment agreements with Shaza L. Andersen, President and Chief Executive Officer of WashingtonFirst Bank, and
Michael J. Rebibo, Executive Vice President of WashingtonFirst Bank and President of 1st Portfolio Wealth Advisors and
WashingtonFirst Mortgage, which provide for a cash severance payment (and, for Ms. Andersen, payment of premiums for
continued health benefits for 12 months) in the event of a termination of employment without cause following a change in
control;

 

 

•  The severance payment agreements with George W. Connors, IV, President and Chief Credit Officer of WashingtonFirst
Bank, Richard D. Horn, General Counsel of WashingtonFirst Bank, and Matthew R. Johnson, Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer of WashingtonFirst Bank, which provide for a cash severance payment and payment of COBRA
costs for continued health benefits for up to 12 months in the event of a termination of employment without cause following
a change in control;

 

 

•  The supplemental executive retirement agreements with Shaza L. Andersen, George W. Connors, IV, Richard D. Horn,
Matthew R. Johnson and Joseph S. Bracewell, Chairman of the Board of WashingtonFirst, which provide each executive
with a vested benefit upon a separation from service following a change in control of WashingtonFirst or WashingtonFirst
Bank; and

 

 

•  That, pursuant to the merger agreement, Shaza L. Andersen, Joseph S. Bracewell and two additional members of
WashingtonFirst’s board of directors are to be appointed as members of the Sandy Spring and Sandy Spring Bank boards of
directors and Shaza L. Andersen and Joseph S. Bracewell are to be appointed to the executive committee of the Sandy
Spring board.

For a more complete description of these interests, see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The
Transactions — Interests of Certain WashingtonFirst Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions” beginning on page 87.

It is anticipated that Ms. Andersen will enter into a consulting and separation agreement with Sandy Spring that will set forth Ms.
Andersen’s entitlements and continuing obligations in connection with her termination of employment with WashingtonFirst and
WashingtonFirst Bank following the effective time of the first-step merger and her service as a non-employee director of and consultant
to Sandy Spring. It is also anticipated that

Mr. Connors will negotiate and enter into a bonus award and release agreement that will provide for certain payments in lieu of the
lump sum cash payment under his severance payment agreement and an employment agreement with Sandy Spring that will set forth
his new position at Sandy Spring following the effective time of the first-step merger. All arrangements entered into with Sandy Spring
will be effective as of the effective time of the first-step merger.

Termination of the merger agreement could negatively impact WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring.

If the merger agreement is terminated, there may be various consequences. For example, WashingtonFirst’s or Sandy Spring’s
businesses may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other opportunities due to management’s focus on the
Transactions, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Transactions. Additionally, if the merger agreement is
terminated, the market price of WashingtonFirst common stock or Sandy Spring common stock could decline to the extent that the
current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Transactions will be completed. If the merger agreement is terminated under
certain circumstances, WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring may be required to pay to the other party a termination fee of $18.5 million.

Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Transactions are
pending.

Uncertainty about the effect of the Transactions on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on WashingtonFirst or
Sandy Spring. These uncertainties may impair WashingtonFirst’s or Sandy Spring’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel
until the Transactions are completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring to seek to
change existing business relationships with WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring. Retention of certain employees by WashingtonFirst or
Sandy Spring may be challenging while the Transactions are pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their
future roles with Sandy Spring. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a
desire not to remain with WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring, WashingtonFirst’s business or Sandy Spring’s business could be harmed. In
addition, subject to certain exceptions, WashingtonFirst has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course prior to closing, and
each of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring has agreed to certain restrictive covenants. See the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement — Covenants and Agreements” beginning on page 101 for a description of the
restrictive covenants applicable to WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring.

Litigation relating to the Transactions could require us to incur significant costs and suffer management distraction, as well as
delay and/or enjoin the Transactions.

On August 1, 2017, Paul Parshall, a purported stockholder of WashingtonFirst, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against WashingtonFirst, the members of the WashingtonFirst board and Sandy
Spring on behalf of all WashingtonFirst public stockholders. The lawsuit alleges that Sandy Spring’s registration statement on Form S-
4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, omitted certain material information, which rendered the registration
statement false and misleading. The relief sought in the lawsuit includes preliminary and permanent injunction against the
consummation of the Transactions, rescission or rescissory damages if the Transactions are completed, costs and attorney’s fees. The
defendants believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against the suit vigorously. However, at this time, it is not
possible to predict the outcome of the lawsuit or the impact on Sandy Spring, WashingtonFirst or the Transactions.

A negative outcome in this suit could have a material adverse effect on WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring if it results in
preliminary or permanent injunctive relief or rescission of the merger agreement. Such action may also create additional uncertainty
relating to the Transactions, and defending such actions may be costly and distracting to management. Neither WashingtonFirst nor
Sandy Spring is currently able to predict the outcome of the suit with any certainty. Additional suits arising out of or relating to the
Transactions may be filed in the

future. If additional similar complaints are filed, absent new or different allegations that are material, WashingtonFirst and Sandy
Spring will not necessarily announce such additional filings.

If the Transactions are not completed, Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst will have incurred substantial expenses without realizing
the expected benefits of the Transactions.

Each of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation
and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of filing, printing and
mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the first-step merger. If
the Transactions are not completed, Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the
expected benefits of the Transactions.

The merger agreement limits WashingtonFirst’s ability to pursue alternative acquisition proposals and requires either company to
pay a termination fee of $18.5 million under limited circumstances, including circumstances relating to acquisition proposals for
WashingtonFirst. Additionally, certain provisions of WashingtonFirst’s articles of incorporation and bylaws may deter potential
acquirers.

The merger agreement prohibits WashingtonFirst from initiating, soliciting, knowingly encouraging or knowingly facilitating
certain third-party acquisition proposals. For more information, see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The
Merger Agreement — Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers” beginning on page 108. The merger agreement also provides that Sandy
Spring or WashingtonFirst must pay a termination fee in the amount of $18.5 million in the event that the merger agreement is
terminated under certain circumstances, including WashingtonFirst’s failure to abide by certain obligations not to solicit acquisition
proposals. See the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Merger Agreement —Termination Fee” beginning on
page 112. These provisions might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant
part of WashingtonFirst from considering or proposing such an acquisition. Each director of WashingtonFirst, solely in his or her
capacity as a WashingtonFirst stockholder has entered into a separate voting agreement with Sandy Spring, pursuant to which each
such director has agreed to vote all shares of WashingtonFirst common stock over which he or she exercises sole disposition and voting
rights in favor of the WashingtonFirst merger proposal and certain related matters, and against alternative transactions. In addition,
Endicott has entered into a similar voting agreement with Sandy Spring, pursuant to which Endicott has agreed to vote all shares of
WashingtonFirst common stock over which it exercises sole disposition and voting rights in favor of the WashingtonFirst merger
proposal and certain related matters, and against alternative transactions. As of the WashingtonFirst record date, (i) the WashingtonFirst
directors that are party to these voting agreements exercised sole disposition and voting rights with respect to 1,089,796 shares of
WashingtonFirst common stock, representing 8.72% of the outstanding shares of WashingtonFirst common stock and (ii) Endicott
exercised sole disposition and voting rights with respect to 1,199,032 shares of WashingtonFirst common stock, representing 9.59% of
the outstanding shares of WashingtonFirst common stock. For more information see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus
entitled “The Merger Agreement — WashingtonFirst Voting Agreements” beginning on page 113. Additionally, certain provisions of
WashingtonFirst’s articles of incorporation or bylaws or of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (which we refer to as the “VSCA”)
could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of WashingtonFirst or may discourage a potential competing acquirer.

The shares of Sandy Spring common stock to be received by WashingtonFirst stockholders as a result of the first-step merger will
have different rights from shares of WashingtonFirst common stock.

The rights of WashingtonFirst stockholders are currently governed by the Virginia Stock Corporation Act, WashingtonFirst’s
articles of incorporation and WashingtonFirst’s bylaws. Upon completion of the first-step merger, WashingtonFirst stockholders will
become Sandy Spring stockholders and their rights as stockholders will then be governed by the Maryland General Corporation Law,
Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation and

Sandy Spring’s bylaws. The rights associated with WashingtonFirst common stock are different from the rights associated with Sandy
Spring common stock. See the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Comparison of Stockholder Rights” beginning
on page 131 for a discussion of the different rights associated with Sandy Spring common stock.

Holders of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring common stock will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the first-step
merger and will exercise less influence over management.

Holders of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring common stock currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of
directors and on other matters affecting WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring, respectively. Upon the completion of the first-step merger,
each WashingtonFirst stockholder who receives shares of Sandy Spring common stock will become a Sandy Spring stockholder with a
percentage ownership of Sandy Spring that is smaller than the stockholder’s percentage ownership of WashingtonFirst. It is currently
expected that the former WashingtonFirst stockholders as a group will receive shares in the first-step merger constituting approximately
32% of the outstanding shares of Sandy Spring common stock immediately after the first-step merger. As a result, current Sandy Spring
stockholders as a group will own approximately 68% of the outstanding shares of Sandy Spring common stock immediately after the
first-step merger. Because of this reduced ownership percentage, WashingtonFirst stockholders may have less influence on the
management and policies of Sandy Spring than they now have on the management and policies of WashingtonFirst, and current Sandy
Spring stockholders may have less influence than they now have on the management and policies of Sandy Spring. Upon
consummation of the Transactions, Sandy Spring has agreed to increase the size of the Sandy Spring board and the board of directors
of Sandy Spring Bank to fifteen members and appoint Shaza L. Andersen, Joseph S. Bracewell and two other current members of the
WashingtonFirst board to the Sandy Spring board and the board of directors of Sandy Spring Bank.

Holders of WashingtonFirst common stock do not have dissenters’ or appraisal rights with respect to the WashingtonFirst merger
proposal.

Dissenters’ rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary
transaction, such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value of their shares as determined by a court in a judicial
proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Virginia law
provides that a stockholder is not entitled to demand the fair value of his or her shares of stock in any transaction if the stock is listed
on a national securities exchange. Because the WashingtonFirst common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the holders of
WashingtonFirst common stock are not entitled to dissenters’ or appraisal rights in the first-step merger. However, the shares of
WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock are not listed on any exchange, and this exception does not apply to holders of
WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock. Therefore, the holders of WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock will have dissenters’
rights with respect to the WashingtonFirst merger proposal.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may include:
management plans relating to the Transactions; the expected timing of the completion of the Transactions; the ability to complete the
Transactions; the ability to obtain any required regulatory, stockholder or other approvals; any statements of the plans and objectives of
management for future operations, products or services, including the execution of integration plans relating to the Transactions; any
statements of expectation or belief; projections related to certain financial metrics; and any statements of assumptions underlying any
of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,”
“outlook,” “estimate,” “forecast,” “project” and other similar words and expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to
numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time and are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements speak
only as of the date they are made. Neither Sandy Spring nor WashingtonFirst assumes any duty and does not undertake to update
forward-looking statements. Because forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions and uncertainties, actual results or future
events could differ, possibly materially, from those that Sandy Spring or WashingtonFirst anticipated in its forward-looking statements
and future results could differ materially from historical performance. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences
include, but are not limited to, those included under Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Sandy Spring’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, those
included under Item 1A “Risk Factors” in WashingtonFirst’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, those disclosed in Sandy Spring’s and
WashingtonFirst’s respective other periodic reports filed with the SEC, as well as the possibility: that expected benefits of the
Transactions may not materialize in the timeframe expected or at all, or may be more costly to achieve; that the Transactions may not
be timely completed, if at all; that prior to the completion of the Transactions or thereafter, Sandy Spring’s and WashingtonFirst’s
respective businesses may not perform as expected due to transaction-related uncertainty or other factors; that the parties are unable to
successfully implement integration strategies relating to the Transactions; that required regulatory, stockholder or other approvals are
not obtained or other customary closing conditions are not satisfied in a timely manner or at all; that Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst
may face reputational risks and the reaction of the companies’ customers, employees and other constituents to the Transactions; and
that management’s time may be diverted to merger-related matters. For any forward-looking statements made in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus or in any documents, Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-
looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

stockholder, on or about September 12, 2017. This joint proxy statement/prospectus is accompanied by a notice of the WashingtonFirst
special meeting and a form of proxy card that the WashingtonFirst board is soliciting for use at the WashingtonFirst special meeting
and at any adjournments of the WashingtonFirst special meeting.

Date, Time and Place of the WashingtonFirst Special Meeting

The WashingtonFirst special meeting will be held at WashingtonFirst’s corporate headquarters located at 11921 Freedom Drive,
Suite 250, Reston, Virginia 20190 at 10:00 a.m., local time, on October 18, 2017. On or about September 12, 2017, WashingtonFirst

At the WashingtonFirst special meeting, you, as a WashingtonFirst stockholder, will be asked to consider and vote upon the
following matters:
 

 •  the WashingtonFirst merger proposal; and
 

 •  the WashingtonFirst adjournment proposal.

Recommendation of the WashingtonFirst Board

The WashingtonFirst board has determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the
first-step merger, are advisable and in the best interests of WashingtonFirst and its stockholders, has unanimously approved the merger
agreement and unanimously recommends that the WashingtonFirst stockholders vote “FOR” the WashingtonFirst merger proposal and
“FOR” the WashingtonFirst adjournment proposal. See the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Transactions
—WashingtonFirst’s Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the WashingtonFirst Board” beginning on page 53 for a more
detailed discussion of the WashingtonFirst board’s recommendation.

WashingtonFirst Record Date and Quorum

The WashingtonFirst board has fixed the close of business on August 31, 2017, as the WashingtonFirst record date for
determining the WashingtonFirst stockholders entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the WashingtonFirst special meeting.

As of the WashingtonFirst record date, there were 12,509,766 shares of WashingtonFirst common stock outstanding and entitled
to notice of, and to vote at, the WashingtonFirst special meeting held by 429 holders of record. Each share of WashingtonFirst common
stock entitles the holder to one vote at the WashingtonFirst special meeting on each proposal to be considered at the WashingtonFirst
special meeting.

The presence at the WashingtonFirst special meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders representing at least a majority of the
issued and outstanding shares of WashingtonFirst common stock entitled to be voted at the WashingtonFirst special meeting will
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the WashingtonFirst special meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any,
will be treated as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for all matters voted on at the
WashingtonFirst special meeting.

Table of Contents

Required Vote; Treatment of Abstentions, Broker Non-Votes and Failure to Vote

WashingtonFirst merger proposal:
 

 
•  Standard: Approval of the WashingtonFirst merger proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding

shares of WashingtonFirst common stock entitled to vote at the WashingtonFirst special meeting.
 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy, fail to submit a proxy or fail to vote in

person at the WashingtonFirst special meeting, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the
WashingtonFirst merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote against the WashingtonFirst merger proposal.

WashingtonFirst adjournment proposal:
 

 
•  Standard: Approval of the WashingtonFirst adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes

cast by WashingtonFirst stockholders entitled to vote at the WashingtonFirst special meeting.
 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy, fail to submit a proxy or fail to vote in

person at the WashingtonFirst special meeting, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the
WashingtonFirst adjournment proposal, it will have no effect on the WashingtonFirst adjournment proposal.

Shares Held by Officers, Directors and Certain Stockholders

As of the WashingtonFirst record date, the directors and executive officers of WashingtonFirst and their affiliates beneficially
owned and were entitled to vote approximately 2,697,307 shares of WashingtonFirst common stock, representing approximately
21.57% of the shares of WashingtonFirst common stock outstanding on that date.

Each of WashingtonFirst’s directors, in his or her capacity as a WashingtonFirst stockholder, has entered into a separate voting
agreement with Sandy Spring, pursuant to which each such director has agreed to vote all shares of WashingtonFirst common stock
over which he or she exercises sole disposition and voting rights in favor of the WashingtonFirst merger proposal and certain related
matters and against alternative transactions. As of the WashingtonFirst record date, (i) the WashingtonFirst directors that are party to
these voting agreements exercised sole disposition and voting rights with respect to 1,089,796 shares of WashingtonFirst common
stock, representing 8.72% of the outstanding shares of WashingtonFirst common stock. In addition, Endicott has also entered into a
voting agreement with Sandy Spring pursuant to which Endicott has agreed to vote all shares of WashingtonFirst common stock over
which it exercises sole disposition and voting rights in favor of the WashingtonFirst merger proposal and certain related matters and
against alternative transactions. As of the WashingtonFirst record date, Endicott exercised sole disposition and voting rights with
respect to 1,199,032 shares of WashingtonFirst common stock, representing 9.59% of the outstanding shares of WashingtonFirst
common stock. For more information regarding the voting agreements, see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled
“The Merger Agreement — WashingtonFirst Voting Agreements” beginning on page 113. As of the WashingtonFirst record date,
Sandy Spring did not beneficially hold any shares of WashingtonFirst common stock.

Voting by Proxy or In Person; Incomplete Proxies

Any WashingtonFirst stockholder may vote by proxy or in person at the WashingtonFirst special meeting.

If you hold your shares of WashingtonFirst common stock in your name as a stockholder of record and wish to attend your special
meeting and vote in person, you may request a ballot when you arrive.

If you hold your shares of WashingtonFirst common stock in your name as a stockholder of record, you may vote by proxy by
mail, through the Internet, or by telephone:
 

 
•  To vote by mail, you must complete, sign, date and mail your proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid return envelope as

soon as possible. Please respond promptly to ensure your proxy card is mailed sufficiently in advance to ensure receipt prior
to your special meeting.

 

 
•  To vote through the Internet, please follow the instructions on the accompanying proxy card as soon as possible. The

instructions in the enclosed proxy card contain the applicable deadlines and other information about voting your shares
through the Internet.

 

 
•  To vote by telephone, please follow the instructions on the accompanying proxy card as soon as possible. The instructions in

the enclosed proxy card contain the applicable deadlines and other information about voting your shares by telephone.

WashingtonFirst requests that WashingtonFirst stockholders vote as soon as possible by completing and signing the
accompanying proxy card and returning it to WashingtonFirst in the enclosed postage-paid envelope , through the Internet, or by
telephone. When the accompanying proxy card is returned properly executed, you will be appointing the “proxies” named in the proxy
card to vote your shares for you at the WashingtonFirst special meeting. The shares of WashingtonFirst common stock represented by
your properly executed proxy card will be voted at the WashingtonFirst special meeting in accordance with the instructions contained
on the proxy card. If any proxy card is returned without indication as to how to vote, the shares of WashingtonFirst common stock
represented by the proxy card will be voted (i) “FOR” the WashingtonFirst merger proposal and (ii) “FOR” the WashingtonFirst
adjournment proposal.

If you vote through the Internet or by telephone, you do not need to sign and return a proxy card. Under Virginia law, you will be
appointing the proxies to vote your shares on the same terms as are described above and with the same authority as if you completed,
signed and returned a proxy card. The authority you will be giving the proxies is described in the proxy card.

Every WashingtonFirst stockholder’s vote is important. Accordingly, each WashingtonFirst stockholder should sign, date and
return the enclosed proxy card, or vote through the Internet or by telephone, whether or not the WashingtonFirst stockholder plans
to attend the WashingtonFirst special meeting in person. Sending in your proxy card or voting on the Internet will not prevent you
from voting your shares personally at the meeting, since you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted.

Shares Held in “Street Name”

If you are a WashingtonFirst stockholder and your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other holder of
record, you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote the shares. Please follow the voting
instructions provided by the bank or broker. WashingtonFirst’s stockholders should check the voting form used by that firm to
determine whether you may vote by telephone or the Internet. You may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card
directly to WashingtonFirst or by voting in person at the WashingtonFirst special meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your
broker, bank or other nominee. Furthermore, brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares of WashingtonFirst common stock on
behalf of their customers will not vote your shares of WashingtonFirst common stock or give a proxy to WashingtonFirst to vote those
shares with respect to the WashingtonFirst merger proposal without specific instructions from you, as brokers, banks and other
nominees do not have discretionary voting power on such proposal.

To ensure that your shares are represented at the WashingtonFirst special meeting and voted in the manner you desire, it is
important that you instruct your bank, broker or other holder of record as to how it should vote your shares.

Revocability of Proxies and Changes to a WashingtonFirst Stockholder’s Vote

If you are the record holder of shares of WashingtonFirst common stock, you have the power to change your vote at any time
before your shares of WashingtonFirst common stock are voted at the WashingtonFirst special meeting by:
 

 •  attending and voting in person at the WashingtonFirst special meeting;
 

 •  giving notice of revocation of the proxy at the WashingtonFirst special meeting;
 

 
•  delivering to the Corporate Secretary of WashingtonFirst at 11921 Freedom Drive, Suite 250, Reston, Virginia 20190 (i) a

written notice of revocation or (ii) a duly executed proxy card relating to the same shares, bearing a date later than the proxy
card previously executed; or

 

 
•  if you appointed the proxies through the Internet or by telephone, you can go to the same Internet website or use the same

telephone number that you previously used to appoint the proxies, and then change your voting instructions.

The proxies will follow the last voting instructions received from you before the WashingtonFirst special meeting. Attendance at
the WashingtonFirst special meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of proxy.

If you choose to send a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card, the new proxy card must be
received before the beginning of the WashingtonFirst special meeting. If your shares are held in “street name” and you have instructed
a bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares of WashingtonFirst common stock, you must follow the directions you receive
from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to change or revoke your vote.

Solicitation of Proxies

This solicitation is made on behalf of the WashingtonFirst board, and WashingtonFirst will pay for the solicitation of proxies from
the WashingtonFirst stockholders. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, Laurel Hill Advisory Group, LLC, WashingtonFirst’s proxy
solicitor, will assist WashingtonFirst in soliciting proxies from the WashingtonFirst stockholders. WashingtonFirst has agreed to pay
$6,000, plus expenses, for these services. WashingtonFirst will, upon request, reimburse brokers, banks and other nominees for their
expenses in sending proxy materials to their customers who are beneficial owners and obtaining their voting instructions. Additionally,
directors, officers and employees of WashingtonFirst may solicit proxies personally and by telephone. None of these persons will
receive additional or special compensation for soliciting proxies.

Attending the WashingtonFirst Special Meeting

All WashingtonFirst stockholders, including holders of record and WashingtonFirst stockholders who hold their shares through
banks, brokers, nominees or any other holder of record are invited to attend the WashingtonFirst special meeting. WashingtonFirst
stockholders of record can vote in person at the WashingtonFirst special meeting. If you are not a WashingtonFirst stockholder of
record, you must obtain a proxy executed in your favor from the record holder of your shares, such as a broker, bank or other nominee,
to be able to vote in person at the WashingtonFirst special meeting. If you plan to attend the WashingtonFirst special meeting, you must
hold your shares in your own name or have a letter from the record holder of your shares confirming your ownership. In addition, you
must bring a form of personal photo identification with you in order to be admitted. WashingtonFirst reserves the right to refuse
admittance to anyone without proper proof of share ownership and without proper photo identification. The use of cameras, sound
recording equipment, communications devices or any similar equipment during the WashingtonFirst special meeting is prohibited
without WashingtonFirst’s express written consent.

THE WASHINGTONFIRST PROPOSALS

Proposal 1 — WashingtonFirst Merger Proposal

WashingtonFirst is asking its stockholders to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including
the first-step merger. WashingtonFirst stockholders should read this joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety,
including the annexes, for more detailed information concerning the merger agreement and the Transactions. A copy of the merger
agreement is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A.

After careful consideration, the WashingtonFirst board unanimously approved the merger agreement, having determined that the
merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the first-step merger, were advisable and in the best interests of
WashingtonFirst and WashingtonFirst’s stockholders. See the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The
Transactions — WashingtonFirst’s Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the WashingtonFirst Board” beginning on page
53 for a more detailed discussion of the WashingtonFirst board’s recommendation.

The WashingtonFirst board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the WashingtonFirst merger proposal.

Proposal 2 — WashingtonFirst Adjournment Proposal

The WashingtonFirst special meeting may be adjourned to another time or place, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the WashingtonFirst special meeting to approve the WashingtonFirst merger
proposal. If, at the WashingtonFirst special meeting, the number of shares of WashingtonFirst common stock present or represented by
proxy and voting in favor of the WashingtonFirst merger proposal is insufficient to approve the WashingtonFirst merger proposal,
WashingtonFirst intends to move to adjourn the WashingtonFirst special meeting in order to enable the WashingtonFirst board to solicit
additional proxies for approval of the WashingtonFirst merger proposal. In that event, WashingtonFirst will ask its stockholders to vote
upon the WashingtonFirst adjournment proposal, but not the WashingtonFirst merger proposal.

In this proposal, WashingtonFirst is asking its stockholders to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the WashingtonFirst
board on a discretionary basis to vote in favor of adjourning the WashingtonFirst special meeting to another time and place for the
purpose of soliciting additional proxies, including the solicitation of proxies from WashingtonFirst stockholders who have previously
voted.

The WashingtonFirst board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the WashingtonFirst adjournment proposal.

THE SANDY SPRING SPECIAL MEETING

This section contains information for Sandy Spring stockholders about the Sandy Spring special meeting that Sandy Spring has
called to allow its stockholders to consider and vote on the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal and the Sandy Spring adjournment
proposal. Sandy Spring is mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to you, as a Sandy Spring stockholder, on or about
September 12, 2017. This joint proxy statement/prospectus is accompanied by a notice of the Sandy Spring special meeting and a form
of proxy card that the Sandy Spring board is soliciting for use at the Sandy Spring special meeting and at any adjournments or
postponements of the Sandy Spring special meeting.

Date, Time and Place of the Sandy Spring Special Meeting

The Sandy Spring special meeting will be held at Sandy Spring’s corporate headquarters located at 17801 Georgia Avenue, Olney,
Maryland 20832, at 9:00 a.m., local time, on October 18, 2017. On or about September 12, 2017, Sandy Spring commenced mailing
this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the enclosed form of proxy card to its stockholders to vote at the Sandy Spring special
meeting.

Matters to Be Considered at the Sandy Spring Special Meeting

At the Sandy Spring special meeting, you, as a Sandy Spring stockholder, will be asked to consider and vote upon the following
matters:
 

 •  the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal; and
 

 •  the Sandy Spring adjournment proposal.

Recommendation of the Sandy Spring Board

The Sandy Spring board has unanimously approved the merger agreement and unanimously recommends that Sandy Spring
stockholders vote “FOR” the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal and “FOR” the Sandy Spring adjournment proposal. See the
section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Transactions — Sandy Spring’s Reasons for the Transactions;
Recommendation of the Sandy Spring Board” beginning on page 70 for a more detailed discussion of the Sandy Spring board’s
recommendation.

Sandy Spring Record Date and Quorum

The Sandy Spring board has fixed the close of business on August 31, 2017, as the Sandy Spring record date for determining the
Sandy Spring stockholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Sandy Spring special meeting.

As of the Sandy Spring record date, there were 24,178,652 shares of Sandy Spring common stock outstanding and entitled to
notice of, and to vote at, the Sandy Spring special meeting held by approximately 2,124 holders of record. Each share of Sandy Spring
common stock entitles the holder to one vote at the Sandy Spring special meeting on each proposal to be considered at the Sandy
Spring special meeting.

The presence at the Sandy Spring special meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders representing at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Sandy Spring common stock entitled to be voted at the Sandy Spring special meeting will constitute a quorum for
the transaction of business at the Sandy Spring special meeting. Once a share is represented for any purpose at the Sandy Spring special
meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the Sandy Spring special meeting or for any adjournment(s)
thereof. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will be included in determining the number of shares present at the meeting for the
purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

Table of Contents

Required Vote; Treatment of Abstentions, Broker Non-Votes and Failure to Vote

Sandy Spring share issuance proposal:
 

 
•  Standard: Approval of the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes

cast by the holders of Sandy Spring common stock at the Sandy Spring special meeting.
 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy, fail to submit a proxy or fail to vote in

person at the Sandy Spring special meeting, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the Sandy
Spring share issuance proposal, it will have no effect on the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal.

•  Standard: Approval of the Sandy Spring adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes

cast by the holders of Sandy Spring common stock at the Sandy Spring special meeting.
 

 
•  Effect of abstentions and broker non-votes: If you mark “ABSTAIN” on your proxy, fail to submit a proxy or fail to vote in

person at the Sandy Spring special meeting, or fail to instruct your bank or broker how to vote with respect to the Sandy
Spring adjournment proposal, it will have no effect on the Sandy Spring adjournment proposal.

Shares Held by Officers, Directors and Certain Stockholders

As of the Sandy Spring record date, the directors and executive officers of Sandy Spring and their affiliates beneficially owned
and were entitled to vote approximately 636,647 shares of Sandy Spring common stock representing approximately 2.64% of the
shares of Sandy Spring common stock outstanding on that date.

Each of Sandy Spring’s directors, in his or her capacity as a Sandy Spring stockholder, has entered into a separate voting
agreement with WashingtonFirst, pursuant to which each such director has agreed to vote all shares of Sandy Spring common stock
over which he or she exercises sole disposition and voting rights in favor of the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal. As of the Sandy
Spring record date, the Sandy Spring directors that are party to these voting agreements exercised sole disposition and voting rights
with respect to 254,220 shares of Sandy Spring common stock, representing 1.06% of the outstanding shares of Sandy Spring common
stock. For more information regarding the voting agreements, see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The
Merger Agreement — Sandy Spring Voting Agreements” beginning on page 114. As of the Sandy Spring record date, WashingtonFirst
did not beneficially hold any shares of Sandy Spring common stock.

Voting by Proxy or in Person; Incomplete Proxies

Any Sandy Spring stockholder may vote by proxy or in person at the Sandy Spring special meeting.

If you hold your shares of Sandy Spring stock in your name as a stockholder of record and wish to attend your special meeting
and vote in person, you may request a ballot when you arrive.

If you hold your shares of Sandy Spring stock in your name as a stockholder of record, you may vote by proxy by mail, through
the Internet, or by telephone:
 

 
•  To vote by mail, you must complete, sign, date and mail your proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid return envelope as

soon as possible. Please respond promptly to ensure your proxy card is mailed sufficiently in advance to ensure receipt prior
to your special meeting.

Table of Contents

 
•  To vote through the Internet, please follow the instructions on the accompanying proxy card as soon as possible. The

instructions in the enclosed proxy card contain the applicable deadlines and other information about voting your shares
through the Internet.

 

 
•  To vote by telephone, please follow the instructions on the accompanying proxy card as soon as possible. The instructions in

the enclosed proxy card contain the applicable deadlines and other information about voting your shares by telephone.

Sandy Spring requests that Sandy Spring stockholders vote as soon as possible by completing and signing the accompanying
proxy card and returning it to Sandy Spring in the enclosed postage-paid envelope, through the Internet, or by telephone. When the
accompanying proxy card is returned properly executed, you will be appointing the “proxies” named in the proxy card to vote your
shares for you at the Sandy Spring special meeting. The shares of Sandy Spring common stock represented by your properly executed
proxy card will be voted at the Sandy Spring special meeting in accordance with the instructions contained on the proxy card. If any
proxy card is returned without indication as to how to vote, the shares of Sandy Spring common stock represented by the proxy card
will be voted (i) “FOR” the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal and (ii) “FOR” the Sandy Spring adjournment proposal.

If you vote through the Internet or by telephone, you do not need to sign and return a proxy card. Under Maryland law, you will
be appointing the proxies to vote your shares on the same terms as are described above and with the same authority as if you
completed, signed and returned a proxy card. The authority you will be giving the proxies is described in the proxy card.

Every Sandy Spring stockholder’s vote is important. Accordingly, each Sandy Spring stockholder should sign, date and return
the enclosed proxy card, or vote through the Internet or by telephone, whether or not the Sandy Spring stockholder plans to attend
the Sandy Spring special meeting in person. Sending in your proxy card or voting on the Internet will not prevent you from voting
your shares personally at the meeting, since you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted.

Shares Held in “Street Name”

If you are a Sandy Spring stockholder and your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other holder of record,
you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote the shares. Please follow the voting instructions
provided by the bank or broker. Sandy Spring’s stockholders should check the voting form used by that firm to determine whether you
may vote by telephone or the Internet. You may not vote shares held in street name by returning a proxy card directly to Sandy Spring
or by voting in person at the Sandy Spring special meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your broker, bank or other nominee.
Furthermore, brokers, banks or other nominees who hold shares of Sandy Spring common stock on behalf of their customers will not
vote your shares of Sandy Spring common stock or give a proxy to Sandy Spring to vote those shares with respect to the Sandy Spring
share issuance proposal without specific instructions from you, as brokers, banks and other nominees do not have discretionary voting
power on such proposal.

To ensure that your shares are represented at the Sandy Spring special meeting and voted in the manner you desire, it is
important that you instruct your bank, broker or other holder of record as to how it should vote your shares.

Revocability of Proxies and Change to a Sandy Spring Stockholder’s Vote

If you are the record holder of shares of Sandy Spring common stock, you have the power to change your vote at any time before
your shares of Sandy Spring common stock are voted at the Sandy Spring special meeting by:
 

 •  attending and voting in person at the Sandy Spring special meeting;

previously executed; or

 

 
•  if you appointed the proxies through the Internet or by telephone, you can go to the same Internet website or use the same

telephone number that you previously used to appoint the proxies, and then change your voting instructions.

The proxies will follow the last voting instructions received from you before the Sandy Spring special meeting. Attendance at the
Sandy Spring special meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocable proxy.

If you choose to send a completed proxy card bearing a later date than your original proxy card, the new proxy card must be
received before the beginning of the Sandy Spring special meeting. If you have instructed a bank, broker or other nominee to vote your
shares of Sandy Spring common stock, you must follow the directions you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to
change or revoke your vote.

Solicitation of Proxies

This solicitation is made on behalf of the Sandy Spring board, and Sandy Spring will pay for the solicitation of proxies from the
Sandy Spring stockholders. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, Laurel Hill Advisory Group, LLC, Sandy Spring’s proxy solicitor,
will assist Sandy Spring in soliciting proxies from the Sandy Spring stockholders. Sandy Spring has agreed to pay $6,000, plus
expenses, for these services. Sandy Spring will, upon request, reimburse brokers, banks and other nominees for their expenses in

If, at the Sandy Spring special meeting, the number of shares of Sandy Spring common stock present or represented by proxy and
voting in favor of the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal is insufficient to approve the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal, Sandy
Spring intends to move to adjourn the Sandy Spring special meeting in order to enable the Sandy Spring board to solicit additional

Sandy Spring adjournment proposal, but not the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal.

THE TRANSACTIONS

The following discussion contains certain information about the Transactions. The discussion is subject, and qualified in its
entirety by reference, to the merger agreement attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated by
reference. We urge you to read carefully this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the merger agreement attached as Annex
A, for a more complete understanding of the Transactions.

Structure of the Transactions

Each of the Sandy Spring board and WashingtonFirst board has unanimously approved the merger agreement. The merger

corporation in the first-step merger and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sandy Spring, (ii) immediately following the first-step merger,

Sandy Spring common stock, subject to adjustment if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is more than $50.15 or less
than $37.07 per share. No fractional shares of Sandy Spring common stock will be issued in connection with the first-step merger, and

entitled “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 95 for additional and more detailed information regarding the legal documents
that govern the Transactions, including information about the conditions to the completion of the integrated mergers and the provisions
for terminating or amending the merger agreement.

Background of the Transactions

From time to time, the boards of directors and senior management of both Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst have independently
conducted reviews of their respective corporate strategies, business objectives and long-term prospects to assess whether there were
opportunities to better maximize stockholder value and the overall success of their organizations. The directors and senior management
teams would consider, without limitation, the historical and projected future financial performance of each organization, including
projected organic growth; the state of the banking industry, generally and in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area
specifically, including consolidation trends and likely opportunities for acquisitive growth; the state of the national and local
economies; the business cycle and stock market performance; and the current and prospective regulatory environment and related
compliance costs. These reviews included periodic assessment of whether the organizations’ corporate strategies, business objectives
and long-term prospects could be advanced through business combinations or similar strategic transactions.

Around the time of WashingtonFirst’s tenth anniversary in April 2014, Joseph Bracewell, WashingtonFirst’s Chairman, and Shaza
Andersen, WashingtonFirst’s President and Chief Executive Officer, discussed WashingtonFirst’s future plans for continued growth and
improved profitability. Ms. Andersen and Mr. Bracewell also discussed the desirability of beginning to think about the range of
strategic alternatives available to WashingtonFirst. Although there was no immediate plan to pursue a potential transaction,
Ms. Andersen and Mr. Bracewell felt it would be appropriate to begin getting acquainted with executives of

banks that had expressed an interest in expansion in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Over the next two and a half years
Ms. Andersen and Mr. Bracewell met informally with senior leadership of a number of financial institutions. The primary purpose of
these meetings was for all parties to get acquainted with one another on a face-to-face basis. No specific or confidential information
was discussed or and no proposals were made at any of these meetings.

During 2016, market multiples for bank stocks steadily increased, and merger activity in WashingtonFirst’s market area continued
to remain robust. In August 2016, one of WashingtonFirst’s principal competitors announced that it was being acquired. That
transaction represented a multiple of tangible book value that prompted management of WashingtonFirst to assess whether it might be
timely to consider seeking a larger merger partner.

Through the fourth quarter of 2016, market multiples for bank stocks had continued to climb, especially after the November
elections. On November 10, 2016, representatives of KBW, an investment banking firm that was subsequently engaged to act as
WashingtonFirst’s financial advisor in a sale of WashingtonFirst, met with Ms. Andersen and Mr. Bracewell to discuss potential
strategic alternatives, including potential acquirers for WashingtonFirst. At this meeting, Ms. Andersen and Mr. Bracewell told the
representatives of KBW that they believed the timing was right for WashingtonFirst to evaluate its strategic options.

Since mid-2014, Ms. Andersen, Mr. Bracewell and other senior leadership of WashingtonFirst met several times with
management of a financial institution, which we refer to herein as “Bank A.” Because of these extensive contacts, Bank A’s expressed
desire to expand in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area market with the WashingtonFirst team as flagship market leaders,
Bank A’s history of successfully executing acquisitions, and the fact that Bank A’s loan portfolio was not overly concentrated in
commercial real estate loans, Ms. Andersen and Mr. Bracewell authorized KBW to approach Bank A. Representatives of KBW met
with Bank A in November, 2016. Bank A responded that it was not in a position to engage in negotiations with WashingtonFirst at that
time; however, Bank A reiterated that the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan market, and WashingtonFirst in particular, would be
high on its priority list once Bank A was in a position to engage.

In December 2016, the senior management of WashingtonFirst, consisting of Ms. Andersen, Messrs. Bracewell and Johnson and
Richard Horn, General Counsel, who we collectively refer to herein as the “WashingtonFirst Executives,” engaged in discussions with
representatives of KBW concerning a potential sale of WashingtonFirst. The WashingtonFirst Executives and the representatives of
KBW discussed, among other things, potential merger partners, the desirability of an in-market versus out-of-market combination,
market timing, the overall economic outlook for the financial services sector in particular and the regional economy in general,
valuation considerations, possible deal points, and the risks associated with a sale strategy.

On December 14, 2016, Daniel J. Schrider, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sandy Spring, contacted Ms. Andersen and
asked to schedule a meeting.

During the latter part of December 2016 and into January 2017, WashingtonFirst established a virtual data room to be utilized by
potential acquirers for the purpose of conducting the diligence necessary to prepare written expressions of interest to acquire
WashingtonFirst.

In early February 2017, the WashingtonFirst Executives and KBW discussed a list of the financial institutions, including Sandy
Spring, to be contacted by KBW to gauge their potential interest in a business combination transaction with WashingtonFirst. The list
of financial institutions was developed with key input from Mr. Bracewell and Ms. Andersen, based in large measure on the positive
feedback and interest received during their meetings with bankers over the prior two years.

On February 9, 2017, Ms. Andersen and Mr. Schrider met for lunch in Reston, Virginia. Ms. Andersen did not disclose at this
lunch meeting that WashingtonFirst was considering a sale of the organization; rather, the two

discussed in more general terms the local and regional banking market generally, and Mr. Schrider’s continuing interest in
WashingtonFirst as a potential strategic partner, effectively continuing a theme of discussion that had begun several years earlier when
Mr. Schrider and Ms. Andersen were first introduced.

At the direction of WashingtonFirst, KBW contacted the potential acquirers approved by the WashingtonFirst Executives, and
invited each of them to execute a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA, as a precondition to learning WashingtonFirst’s identity and
receiving confidential information about WashingtonFirst and the acquisition opportunity. Following the signing of an NDA, a
Confidential Information Memorandum which had been prepared by WashingtonFirst, with KBW’s assistance, during January and
early February was provided to the potential acquirers. The Confidential Information Memorandum contained detailed instructions for
submitting written expressions of interest to acquire WashingtonFirst, as well as summary information about WashingtonFirst,
including an historical overview, performance highlights, loan and deposit detail, capitalization, forecasted earnings and an analysis of
cost savings to be achieved in a merger.

In all, KBW contacted 18 financial institutions that were approved by the WashingtonFirst Executives, including Bank A and
Sandy Spring. KBW’s initial communications provided general information about the nature of WashingtonFirst, but did not identify
WashingtonFirst by name. Nine of the 18 institutions signed NDAs, including Bank A and Sandy Spring, and were provided with the
Confidential Information Memorandum and access to WashingtonFirst’s virtual data room to conduct preliminary due diligence. Per
the instructions contained in the Confidential Information Memorandum, interested parties were requested to submit their written
expressions of interest to acquire WashingtonFirst by March 7, 2017.

On March 1, 2017, Mr. Schrider, together with Philip J. Mantua, Sandy Spring’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial
Officer, and representatives of The Kafafian Group, Inc. (which we refer to as The Kafafian Group), Sandy Spring’s financial advisor,
reviewed financial aspects of a possible acquisition of WashingtonFirst with the Sandy Spring board’s Executive and Governance
Committee, which approved the submission of a non-binding indication of interest.

By letter dated March 7, 2017, Sandy Spring provided a non-binding expression of interest in the combination of WashingtonFirst
and Sandy Spring, which we refer to herein as the Letter of Intent. In its Letter of Intent, Sandy Spring proposed to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of WashingtonFirst for shares of Sandy Spring, at an exchange ratio of 0.8713 shares of Sandy Spring stock for each
share of WashingtonFirst stock. Based on the closing price of Sandy Spring’s common stock on March 6, 2017, the implied per share
value of the Letter of Intent was $38.00 per share for WashingtonFirst. Sandy Spring also proposed to assume all outstanding
WashingtonFirst warrants and to cash out each WashingtonFirst stock option, whether vested or unvested, for the difference between
the market value of the stock consideration per share and each stock option’s exercise price. Sandy Spring also expressed an interest in
retention of certain key members of the WashingtonFirst executive management team. Additionally, Sandy Spring proposed to expand
the Sandy Spring board and the board of directors of its banking subsidiary, Sandy Spring Bank, and to appoint four non-employee
directors of WashingtonFirst to fill the newly created positions. The proposal was expressly subject to the completion of due diligence
review by Sandy Spring, the execution of a definitive agreement and both regulatory and stockholder approvals. The March 7, 2017
Letter of Intent was the first expression by Sandy Spring of the proposed terms for a transaction.

On March 9, 2017, WashingtonFirst convened a meeting of the WashingtonFirst board’s Executive Committee to evaluate the
terms of the Letter of Intent and to decide whether to proceed with consideration of the merger opportunity. The Executive Committee
consisted of Bracewell and Andersen, as well as WashingtonFirst’s independent directors: C.E. Andrews, Juan Mencia, Madhu Mohan,
William Oldaker and Kenneth Morrissette. The Executive Committee reviewed preliminary information from KBW regarding financial
aspects of the proposal and discussed the matter extensively. The Executive Committee considered how the proposal compared with
WashingtonFirst’s strategic vision described above and noted that the Sandy Spring proposal would capture in just over one year
approximately 60% of the stock value appreciation targeted in the

strategic vision over a five year period. The Executive Committee also considered the possible benefits of waiting until other interested
parties might be in a position to submit a bid, concluding that the Sandy Spring proposal appeared to be a strong enough bid that it was
unlikely to be improved upon by waiting. The Executive Committee also discussed the desirability of a cash component to the
consideration or a price protection mechanism. After considerable discussion, the Executive Committee voted unanimously to
authorize the WashingtonFirst Executives and KBW to continue discussions with Sandy Spring and another financial institution, which
we refer to herein as “Bank B,” for the sale of WashingtonFirst. The WashingtonFirst Executives informed representatives of KBW of
the decision of the Executive Committee later that day.

On March 16, 2017, representatives of WashingtonFirst, Sandy Spring, KBW and The Kafafian Group met at the Tower Club in
Tysons Corner. At this meeting, WashingtonFirst advised Sandy Spring of WashingtonFirst’s desire for a cash component to the
consideration or other price protection mechanism. WashingtonFirst also informed Sandy Spring that they would be invited to begin
detailed due diligence efforts on WashingtonFirst’s operations and financial condition with the goal of submitting a revised indication
of interest to WashingtonFirst by April 7, 2017. Over the ensuing weeks, Sandy Spring was provided additional detailed due diligence
information through the virtual data room, as well as conducting onsite credit due diligence and selected due diligence discussions with
members of WashingtonFirst’s executive team.

On March 27, 2017, Sandy Spring and Sandler O’Neill entered into an engagement letter pursuant to which Sandler O’Neill
would provide a fairness opinion to the Sandy Spring board.

On March 29, 2017, Ms. Andersen and Mr. Horn had lunch in Reston, Virginia with representatives of Troutman Sanders LLP,
WashingtonFirst’s legal counsel, at which time the group discussed at a high-level the terms of the Letter of Intent and related legal and
business issues.

On March 29, 2017, a regular meeting of the Sandy Spring board was held. Among other things, the Sandy Spring board was
briefed on discussions with WashingtonFirst by management and representatives of The Kafafian Group. The terms of the March 7
Letter of Intent, including its financial and other terms, were discussed in detail. The Sandy Spring board was informed that
WashingtonFirst may request some protection against volatility in the price of Sandy Spring stock. After discussion, the Sandy Spring
board encouraged management to continue to conduct due diligence and express interest in a possible transaction along the terms
discussed.

On April 4, 2017, the WashingtonFirst Executives and Mr. Connors met with the following executives of Sandy Spring at the
Tysons Corner, Virginia office of Troutman Sanders: Mr. Schrider; Mr. Mantua; Ronda McDowell, Executive Vice President and Chief
Credit Officer; Joseph J. O’Brien, Executive Vice President Commercial & Retail Banking; and Ronald E. Kuykendall, Executive Vice
President, General Counsel and Secretary. Also present at this meeting were representatives of KBW, The Kafafian Group, and
Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP, Sandy Spring’s legal counsel (which we refer to as Kilpatrick Townsend). The meeting
participants engaged in high level discussions of each organization’s business philosophy, including commercial and retail strategies,
credit culture, management and operational matters, and strategic vision.

By letter dated April 7, 2017, Sandy Spring presented an updated non-binding expression of interest to acquire WashingtonFirst,
which we refer to herein as the Updated Letter of Intent. The material terms of the Updated Letter of Intent were substantially
unchanged from the Letter of Intent, including that each outstanding common share of WashingtonFirst would be acquired at an
exchange ratio of 0.8713 shares of Sandy Spring common stock for each common share of WashingtonFirst. In the Updated Letter of
Intent, Sandy Spring noted that it would be open to discussing a form of price protection for its and WashingtonFirst’s respective
stockholder bases. Sandy Spring also specified that Ms. Andersen and Mr. Bracewell would be two of the four WashingtonFirst
directors appointed to the Sandy Spring board and that two of the legacy WashingtonFirst directors would also serve on the Executive
Committee of the Sandy Spring board.

Simultaneous with delivery of the Updated Letter of Intent, Sandy Spring provided WashingtonFirst with a proposed Exclusivity
Agreement, granting the parties a period of 45 days in which to negotiate the terms of a definitive merger agreement, and a draft form
of merger agreement based upon the terms of Sandy Spring’s Updated Letter of Intent.

Following WashingtonFirst’s receipt of the March 7, 2017 Letter of Intent, Bank B had expressed an interest to KBW in
continuing to analyze a potential acquisition of WashingtonFirst and requested that it be permitted to retain access to the virtual data
room, though it did not submit an indication of interest at that time. During the period between the submission of Sandy Spring’s Letter
of Intent and the Updated Letter of Intent, in accordance with WashingtonFirst’s directives, KBW periodically had conversations with
Bank B about its continued interest in submitting an indication of interest to acquire WashingtonFirst. KBW advised WashingtonFirst
that Bank B knew that WashingtonFirst was moving forward with a proposal and was nevertheless evaluating whether or not to submit
a competing bid. Following the receipt of Sandy Spring’s Updated Letter of Intent, in accordance with WashingtonFirst’s directives,
KBW reached out to Bank B again about its interest in submitting a proposal to acquire WashingtonFirst. Bank B then notified KBW
that it was not in a position to bid for WashingtonFirst at that time due to reasons unrelated to WashingtonFirst.

Following receipt of the Updated Letter of Intent, WashingtonFirst discussed with Sandy Spring its desire to revise the pricing
structure in Sandy Spring’s Updated Letter of Intent to provide WashingtonFirst with some protection against volatility in the price of
Sandy Spring stock between the date of a signed merger agreement and the closing of the transaction. On April 19, 2017, Ms. Andersen
met in person with Mr. Schrider to discuss this request.

After further negotiation, by letter dated April 21, 2017, Sandy Spring provided an addendum to the Updated Letter of Intent,
which we refer to herein as the Addendum, that included an adjustment to the pricing mechanism based on a twenty day volume
weighted average price, as described below under “The Merger Agreement — Structure of the Transactions; Merger Consideration.”

On April 23, 2017, WashingtonFirst convened another meeting of the WashingtonFirst board’s Executive Committee to consider
and vote on whether to recommend that the full WashingtonFirst board approve the Updated Letter of Intent and Addendum. Following
an update from Ms. Andersen, Mr. Bracewell and representatives of KBW on events since the prior Executive Committee meeting, the
Committee voted unanimously to recommend that the WashingtonFirst board accept the Updated Letter of Intent and Addendum,
execute the Exclusivity Agreement, conduct reverse due diligence and negotiate the terms of a definitive merger agreement.

On April 24, 2017, Sandy Spring provided an updated draft of a form of merger agreement. The updated form of merger
agreement reflected the changes in pricing terms proposed by Sandy Spring in its Addendum of April 21, 2017.

On April 26, 2017 a regular meeting of the Sandy Spring board was held. The board was briefed in detail on the Updated Letter
of Intent and Addendum, the results of further diligence and the status of negotiations with WashingtonFirst, including a general
description of the terms of the proposed merger agreement and Sandy Spring’s request that WashingtonFirst agree to deal exclusively
with Sandy Spring on customary terms. After discussion, the board encouraged management to complete its due diligence and continue
negotiations for a possible transaction.

On April 26, 2017, the full WashingtonFirst board met for the purpose of considering the Updated Letter of Intent and
Addendum. Following an overview by Ms. Andersen, Mr. Bracewell and management of events and discussions to that date,
representatives of KBW discussed financial aspects of the proposed transaction based on the terms of the Updated Letter of Intent and
Addendum and gave an overview of each of Sandy Spring’s and WashingtonFirst’s business, performance and competitive positioning.
Representatives of KBW also discussed

the banking industry more generally and recent developments in the trading prices of WashingtonFirst, Sandy Spring and similar
financial institutions generally. Social aspects of the proposed transaction were also discussed at this meeting. WashingtonFirst would
receive four of 15 board seats, two of which would include Mr. Bracewell and Ms. Andersen. Mr. Bracewell and Ms. Andersen would
also serve on the Executive Committee of the Sandy Spring board. It was also noted that Sandy Spring had agreed to establish a bonus
retention pool for key WashingtonFirst Bank employees, and the transaction would be subject to customary regulatory and stockholder
approvals. Following robust discussion, the WashingtonFirst board voted unanimously to proceed with accepting the Updated Letter of
Intent and Addendum, executing the Exclusivity Agreement, conducting reverse due diligence and negotiating the terms of a definitive
merger agreement.

WashingtonFirst executed the Exclusivity Agreement on April 27, 2017, after which WashingtonFirst began its reverse due
diligence and the parties and their respective legal advisers continued to negotiate the final terms of the merger agreement and related
voting agreements.

On May 5, 2017, WashingtonFirst completed reverse due diligence with telephonic management interviews of senior
management of Sandy Spring. Representatives from Sandy Spring, The Kafafian Group, Kilpatrick Townsend, WashingtonFirst, KBW
and Troutman Sanders participated in the call.

Over the course of the following days, the parties, with the assistance of their respective legal and financial advisors, continued to
negotiate and finalize the terms of the proposed transaction and exchange drafts of the merger agreement. Mr. Schrider and
Ms. Andersen discussed potential roles for Ms. Andersen in the combined company.

On May 12, 2017, Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst conducted a bilateral bring-down diligence teleconference to confirm there
were no material developments that needed to be disclosed in advance of the parties’ pending board meetings. Representatives from
Sandy Spring, The Kafafian Group, Sandler O’Neill, Kilpatrick Townsend, WashingtonFirst, KBW and Troutman Sanders participated
in the call.

On May 13, 2017, Kilpatrick Townsend circulated an execution version of the merger agreement to Troutman Sanders.

On May 15, 2017, the WashingtonFirst board held a regular meeting, which was attended by all directors, members of senior
management, KBW and Troutman Sanders. At this meeting, KBW reviewed the financial aspects of the proposed merger and delivered
to the WashingtonFirst board its opinion (a copy of which is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex E) to the effect
that, as of that date and subject to the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on
the review undertaken by KBW as set forth in such opinion, the exchange ratio in the proposed first-step merger (defined, for purposes
of the opinion, as the ratio of 0.8713 of a share of Sandy Spring common stock for one share of WashingtonFirst common stock) was
fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of WashingtonFirst common stock. The Washington First board also received a
presentation from Troutman Sanders regarding the structure of the merger, the proposed terms of the merger agreement and the director
voting agreements, duties of the WashingtonFirst board under applicable law and how those duties related to the process that
WashingtonFirst (including the WashingtonFirst board) employed in considering the business combination with Sandy Spring.
Following discussion among the directors, including a consideration of the presentations and the factors described in the section of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “— WashingtonFirst’s Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the WashingtonFirst
Board,” and questions to and answers from senior management, KBW and Troutman Sanders, the WashingtonFirst board unanimously
determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the integrated mergers, were advisable and
in the best interests of WashingtonFirst’s stockholders and unanimously resolved to approve and adopt, and to recommend that
WashingtonFirst’s stockholders approve and adopt, the Transactions, the merger agreement, the related plan of merger and other
supporting documents.

Also on May 15, 2017, the Sandy Spring board met to discuss the proposed transaction. Representatives of The Kafafian Group,
Sandler O’Neill and Kilpatrick Townsend were present at that meeting. The Sandy Spring board had been provided with a set of
meeting materials in advance of the meeting, including a summary of the terms and conditions of the merger agreement prepared by
Kilpatrick Townsend. A representative of Sandler O’Neill reviewed with the Sandy Spring board its financial analysis of the
Transactions and rendered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing (a copy of which is attached to this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as Annex F), to the Sandy Spring board that, as of the date of the opinion, and based upon and subject to
the factors and assumptions set forth in the opinion, the exchange ratio in the first-step merger was fair, from a financial point of view,
to Sandy Spring. A representative of Kilpatrick Townsend reviewed the terms of the proposed merger agreement with the Sandy Spring
board. After extensive discussions, including a consideration of the presentations and the factors described in the section of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus entitled “— Sandy Spring’s Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the Sandy Spring Board,”
the Sandy Spring board unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined to recommend that the Sandy Spring
stockholders approve the Sandy Spring share issuance.

The merger agreement was entered into by Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst the evening of May 15, 2017. The transaction was
announced via a joint press release issued prior to the opening of trading on May 16, 2017.

WashingtonFirst’s Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the WashingtonFirst Board

After careful consideration, the WashingtonFirst board, at a meeting held on May 15, 2017, unanimously determined that the
merger agreement, including the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated thereby, is in the best interests of
WashingtonFirst and its stockholders. Accordingly, the WashingtonFirst board has unanimously approved the Transactions and the
merger agreement and unanimously recommends that WashingtonFirst’s stockholders vote “FOR” approval of the merger agreement
and the Transactions.

In evaluating the Transactions and the merger agreement, the WashingtonFirst board consulted with WashingtonFirst’s
management and WashingtonFirst’s financial and legal advisors. The WashingtonFirst board carefully considered the terms of the
merger agreement and the value of the merger consideration to be received by WashingtonFirst’s stockholders and ultimately
determined that it was in the best interests of WashingtonFirst and its stockholders for WashingtonFirst to enter into the merger
agreement with Sandy Spring. The WashingtonFirst board believes that partnering with Sandy Spring and becoming the largest locally-
headquartered community bank in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area will maximize the long-term value of its stockholders’
investment in WashingtonFirst, and that the merger will provide the combined company with additional resources necessary to compete
more effectively in Northern Virginia and the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.

In reaching its unanimous decision to approve the Transactions and the merger agreement and to recommend that the
WashingtonFirst stockholders vote “FOR” approval of the Transactions and the merger agreement, the WashingtonFirst board
considered many factors, including, without limitation, the following:
 

 
•  the extensive review undertaken by WashingtonFirst’s Executive Committee, with the assistance of WashingtonFirst’s

executive management and WashingtonFirst’s financial and legal advisors, with respect to the strategic alternatives available
to WashingtonFirst;

 

 
•  the substantial management, financial and employee resources that would be required to execute WashingtonFirst’s strategic

plan, the length of time it would take to achieve the objectives of its strategic plan and the risks and challenges inherent in
the successful execution of its strategic plan;

 

 

•  its understanding of the current and prospective economic environment in which WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring operate,
including the interest rate environment, the competitive and regulatory environments for financial institutions generally, the
increased regulatory burdens on financial institutions, the uncertainties of the regulatory environment in the future and the
likely effect of these factors on WashingtonFirst both with and without the Transactions;

•  the feasibility and prospects of WashingtonFirst continuing to operate independently, including WashingtonFirst’s ability to
compete with much larger regional and national banks, the challenges associated with hiring and retaining senior
management personnel experienced in the management of larger institutions, the potential need to eventually raise additional
capital that could be dilutive to existing WashingtonFirst stockholders and the potential future trading value of
WashingtonFirst common stock compared to the implied value of the merger consideration offered by Sandy Spring;

 

 
•  Sandy Spring’s asset size, capital position and financial performance in recent periods, which make Sandy Spring an

attractive merger partner and would increase the combined company’s asset base to approximately $7.5 billion;
 

 
•  the additional products offered by Sandy Spring to its customers, the ability of the combined company to provide

comprehensive financial services to its customers, and the potential for operating synergies and cross-marketing of products
and services across the combined company, and the diversity of revenue sources associated with such products and services;

 

 
•  the anticipated continued participation of certain of WashingtonFirst’s directors, officers and employees, including Shaza

Andersen and Joseph Bracewell, in the combined company, which enhances the likelihood that the strategic benefits
expected to be achieved as a result of the Transactions will be realized;

2017, of KBW to the WashingtonFirst board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the
opinion, to the holders of WashingtonFirst common stock of the exchange ratio in the proposed Transactions, as more fully
described below under “— Opinion of WashingtonFirst’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 57;

 

 

•  the presentation by Troutman Sanders LLP, legal counsel to WashingtonFirst, regarding the structure of the Transactions, the
terms of the merger agreement, the duties of the WashingtonFirst board under applicable law and how those duties related to

transactions, including the merger with Sandy Spring;

 

 
•  the value of the Sandy Spring common stock consideration being offered to WashingtonFirst stockholders in relation to the

market value, book value per share, tangible book value per share, earnings per share and projected earnings per share of
WashingtonFirst;

 

 
•  the fact that the merger consideration represented approximately 2.56 times the book value per share of WashingtonFirst

common stock based on the closing price of Sandy Spring common stock on May 12, 2017 and represented a premium of
approximately 33.4% to WashingtonFirst’s closing stock price as of the same day;

 

 
•  the expected future payment after completion of the Transactions of significant dividends to legacy WashingtonFirst

stockholders, based on Sandy Spring’s current and forecasted dividend yield;
 

 
•  the market capitalization and trading liquidity of Sandy Spring common stock in the event WashingtonFirst stockholders

desired to sell the shares of Sandy Spring common stock to be received by them upon completion of the Transactions;
 

 
•  the price protection in the form of a price collar fixing the deal value per share of WashingtonFirst common stock at $32.30

per share if the average closing price of Sandy Spring’s common stock, measured pursuant to the terms of the merger
agreement, is equal to or greater than $34.00 and less than $37.07 per share;

•  the ability to terminate the merger agreement if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price falls below $34.00 per

share, subject to Sandy Spring’s right to prevent a walkaway by increasing the exchange ratio or agreeing to add a cash
component to the per share consideration as more fully set forth in the merger agreement;

 

 
•  the potential value of an expansion of the Sandy Spring branch network, particularly in northern Virginia, adding

WashingtonFirst branch locations to Sandy Spring’s existing branch network in Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, D.C.;
 

 
•  the increased possibilities for growth, both organically and through possible future acquisitions, that would be available to

the combined company, given its larger size, asset base, capital and footprint;

community service and support of community-based non-profit organizations and causes;
 

 •  the likelihood of successful integration and operation of the combined company;
 

 •  the likelihood of obtaining the regulatory approvals needed to complete the transaction;

•  the effects of the Transactions on WashingtonFirst employees, including the prospects for continued employment and the

severance and other benefits agreed to be provided to WashingtonFirst employees.

In addition to considering the factors described above, the WashingtonFirst board also considered a number of potential risks and
uncertainties associated with the Transactions in connection with its deliberations on the Transactions, including without limitation the
following factors:
 

 •  the challenges of integrating WashingtonFirst’s businesses, operations and employees with those of Sandy Spring;
 

 
•  the potential effects of the Transactions on WashingtonFirst’s deposit and loan customers, employees and on the

communities in which WashingtonFirst operates;
 

 
•  the need to obtain approval by stockholders of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring, as well as regulatory approvals in order to

complete the Transactions;
 

 
•  the risks associated with the operations of the combined company, including the ability to achieve the anticipated cost

savings;
 

 
•  the fact that certain WashingtonFirst directors and executive officers have interests in the Transactions that are different

from, or in addition to, those of other WashingtonFirst stockholders, as more fully discussed under “— Interests of Certain
WashingtonFirst Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions” on page 87;

 

 

•  the risks associated with entry into the merger agreement and the conduct of WashingtonFirst’s business before the
Transactions are completed, including diversion of management’s attention and resources from the operation of
WashingtonFirst’s business in planning for the merger and executing integration plans and the possibility of employee
attrition or adverse effects on client and business relationships as a result of the announcement and pendency of the
Transactions;

 

 
•  the impact that provisions of the merger agreement relating to the payment of a termination fee by WashingtonFirst may

have on WashingtonFirst receiving superior acquisition offers; and
 

 
•  the fact that the value of the aggregate and per share merger consideration will fluctuate with the market price of Sandy

Spring’s common stock if the average price of Sandy Spring’s common stock

and per share merger consideration from the values at the time the merger agreement was approved.

The WashingtonFirst board also considered the structural protections included in the merger agreement, such as the ability of
WashingtonFirst to terminate the merger agreement if, without limitation:
 

 
•  Sandy Spring breaches the representation that, since December 31, 2016, no event has occurred or circumstance arisen that

has had, or is reasonably expected to have, a material adverse effect with respect to Sandy Spring, which breach cannot be or
has not been cured within 30 days after written notice of the breach to Sandy Spring;

 

 
•  Sandy Spring materially breaches any of its covenants or agreements under the merger agreement, which material breach

cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after written notice of the breach to Sandy Spring; or
 

 

•  any required approval of any government authority is denied by final nonappealable action of such government authority, or
the Sandy Spring stockholders do not approve the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal at the Sandy Spring special meeting
or the WashingtonFirst stockholders do not approve the WashingtonFirst merger proposal at the WashingtonFirst special
meeting.

The WashingtonFirst board also noted that it could terminate the merger agreement if the volume-weighted average closing price
of Sandy Spring common stock, as determined pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, is less than $34.00, subject however, to
Sandy Spring’s rights under the merger agreement to prevent WashingtonFirst’s termination by agreeing to provide WashingtonFirst’s
stockholders with a minimum deal value of $32.30 per share of WashingtonFirst common stock by either increasing the exchange ratio
or adding a cash component to the merger consideration.

Finally, the WashingtonFirst board took note of its right to participate in discussions with respect to an unsolicited acquisition
proposal, as defined in the merger agreement, that was received by WashingtonFirst in compliance with the non-solicitation provisions
of the merger agreement and that constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a transaction that involves consideration to the
WashingtonFirst stockholders that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, than the merger consideration under the merger
agreement. In the event the WashingtonFirst board, in the exercise of their fiduciary obligations to WashingtonFirst’s stockholders,
recommend or endorse such an acquisition proposal, Sandy Spring would have the right to terminate the merger agreement and collect
from WashingtonFirst a termination fee of $18.5 million. The amount of this potential termination fee was negotiated at arm’s-length
and was deemed by the WashingtonFirst board to be reasonable based upon the break-up fees provided for in comparable transactions
and the fact that multiple institutions had already been given an opportunity to bid prior to the approval of the merger agreement. As of
the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, no unsolicited acquisition proposals have been received.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the WashingtonFirst board is not intended to be exhaustive,
but includes the material factors considered by the WashingtonFirst board. In view of the wide variety and complexity of factors
considered in connection with its evaluation of the Transactions, the WashingtonFirst board did not find it practicable to, and did not
attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination and
recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The WashingtonFirst board did
not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any factor, or any particular aspect of any factor, supported or did not
support its ultimate determination. The WashingtonFirst board based its recommendation on the totality of the information considered.

The WashingtonFirst board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the approval of the WashingtonFirst merger proposal
and “FOR” the WashingtonFirst adjournment proposal. WashingtonFirst stockholders should be aware that WashingtonFirst’s directors
and executive officers have interests in the

Transactions that are different from, or in addition to, those of other WashingtonFirst stockholders. The WashingtonFirst board was
aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the Transactions,
and in unanimously recommending that the merger agreement by approved by the WashingtonFirst stockholders. See “— Interests of
Certain WashingtonFirst Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions” on page 87.

Opinion of WashingtonFirst’s Financial Advisor

WashingtonFirst engaged KBW to render financial advisory and investment banking services to WashingtonFirst, including an
opinion to the WashingtonFirst board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of WashingtonFirst common stock
of the exchange ratio to be received by such stockholders in the proposed first-step merger. WashingtonFirst selected KBW because
KBW is a nationally recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience in transactions similar to the Transactions. As
part of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of financial services businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions.

As part of its engagement, representatives of KBW attended the meeting of the WashingtonFirst board held on May 15, 2017, at
which the WashingtonFirst board evaluated the proposed Transactions. At this meeting, KBW reviewed the financial aspects of the
proposed Transactions and rendered to the WashingtonFirst board an opinion to the effect that, as of such date and subject to the
procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW as
set forth in its opinion, the exchange ratio in the proposed first-step merger (defined, for purposes of the opinion, as the ratio of 0.8713
of a share of Sandy Spring common stock for one share of WashingtonFirst common stock) was fair, from a financial point of view, to
the holders of WashingtonFirst common stock. The WashingtonFirst board approved the merger agreement at this meeting.

The description of the opinion set forth herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion, which is
attached as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference, and describes the procedures
followed, assumptions made, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by KBW in preparing the
opinion.

KBW’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was for the information of, and was directed to, the
WashingtonFirst board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of the financial terms of the integrated
mergers. The opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio in the first-step merger
to the holders of WashingtonFirst common stock. It did not address the underlying business decision of WashingtonFirst to
engage in the integrated mergers or enter into the merger agreement or constitute a recommendation to the WashingtonFirst
board in connection with the integrated mergers, and it does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of
WashingtonFirst voting common stock or any stockholder of any other entity as to how to vote in connection with the
integrated mergers or any other matter, nor does it constitute a recommendation regarding whether or not any stockholder of
WashingtonFirst or any other entity should enter into a voting, stockholders’, or affiliates’ agreement with respect to the
Transactions or exercise any dissenters’ or appraisal rights that may be available to such stockholder.

KBW’s opinion was reviewed and approved by KBW’s Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with its policies and
procedures established under the requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

In connection with the opinion, KBW reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating
condition of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring and bearing upon the integrated mergers, including, among other things:
 

 •  a draft of the merger agreement dated May 15, 2017 (the most recent draft then made available to KBW);

during the three-year period ended March 31, 2017;

 

 
•  certain other interim reports and other communications of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring to their respective

stockholders; and
 

 
•  other financial information concerning the businesses and operations of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring that was

furnished to KBW by WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring or which KBW was otherwise directed to use for purposes of
KBW’s analyses.

KBW’s consideration of financial information and other factors that it deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to
its analyses included, among others, the following:
 

 •  the historical and current financial position and results of operations of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring;
 

 •  the assets and liabilities of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring;
 

 •  the nature and terms of certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the banking industry;
 

 
•  a comparison of certain financial and stock market information for WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring with similar

information for certain other companies the securities of which were publicly traded;
 

 
•  financial and operating forecasts and projections of WashingtonFirst that were prepared by, and provided to KBW and

discussed with KBW by, WashingtonFirst management and that were used and relied upon by KBW at the direction of such
management and with the consent of the WashingtonFirst board;

 

 

•  publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Sandy Spring for 2017 and 2018, as well as, for 2018, adjustments thereto
by Sandy Spring management for current tax rates and assumed long-term Sandy Spring growth rates provided to KBW by
Sandy Spring management, all of which information was discussed with KBW by Sandy Spring management and used and
relied upon by KBW based on such discussions, at the direction of WashingtonFirst management and with the consent of the
WashingtonFirst board; and

 

 

•  estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the integrated mergers on Sandy Spring (including, without
limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the integrated mergers) that were
prepared by, and provided to and discussed with KBW by, Sandy Spring management, and used and relied upon by KBW
based on such discussions, at the direction of WashingtonFirst management and with the consent of the WashingtonFirst
board.

KBW also performed such other studies and analyses as it considered appropriate and took into account its assessment of general
economic, market and financial conditions and its experience in other transactions, as well

as its experience in securities valuation and knowledge of the banking industry generally. KBW also participated in discussions held by
the managements of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring regarding the past and current business operations, regulatory relations,
financial condition and future prospects of their respective companies and such other matters as KBW deemed relevant to its inquiry. In
addition, KBW considered the results of the efforts undertaken by WashingtonFirst, with KBW’s assistance, to solicit indications of
interest from third parties regarding a potential transaction with WashingtonFirst.

In conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, KBW relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial and other information that was provided to it or that was publicly available and did not independently verify the accuracy or
completeness of any such information or assume any responsibility or liability for such verification, accuracy or completeness. KBW
relied upon the management of WashingtonFirst as to the reasonableness and achievability of the financial and operating forecasts and
projections of WashingtonFirst referred to above (and the assumptions and bases therefor), and KBW assumed that such forecasts and
projections were reasonably prepared and represented the best currently available estimates and judgments of such management and
that such forecasts and projections would be realized in the amounts and in the time periods estimated by such management. KBW
further relied, with the consent of WashingtonFirst, upon Sandy Spring management as to the reasonableness and achievability of the
publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Sandy Spring (as adjusted for 2018), the assumed Sandy Spring long-term growth
rates, and the estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the Transactions on Sandy Spring, all as referred to above (and
the assumptions and bases for all such information, including, without limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to
result or be derived from the Transactions), and KBW assumed that all such information was reasonably prepared and represented, or
in the case of the Sandy Spring “street estimates” (as adjusted for 2018) referred to above that such estimates were consistent with, the
best currently available estimates and judgments of Sandy Spring management and that the forecasts, projections and estimates
reflected in such information would be realized in the amounts and in the time periods estimated.

It is understood that the portion of the foregoing financial information of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring that was provided to
KBW was not prepared with the expectation of public disclosure, that all of the foregoing financial information, including the publicly
available consensus “street estimates” of Sandy Spring, was based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently
uncertain, including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions and that, accordingly, actual
results could vary significantly from those set forth in such information. KBW assumed, based on discussions with the respective
managements of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring and with the consent of the WashingtonFirst board, that all such information
provided a reasonable basis upon which KBW could form its opinion and KBW expressed no view as to any such information or the
assumptions or bases therefor. KBW relied on all such information without independent verification or analysis and did not in any
respect assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof.

KBW also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations,
business or prospects of either WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring since the date of the last financial statements of each such entity that
were made available to KBW. KBW is not an expert in the independent verification of the adequacy of allowances for loan and lease
losses and KBW assumed, without independent verification and with WashingtonFirst’s consent, that the aggregate allowances for loan
and lease losses for WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring are adequate to cover such losses. In rendering its opinion, KBW did not make
or obtain any evaluations or appraisals or physical inspection of the property, assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of
WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring, the collateral securing any of such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, nor did
KBW examine any individual loan or credit files, nor did it evaluate the solvency, financial capability or fair value of WashingtonFirst
or Sandy Spring under any state or federal laws, including those relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other matters. Estimates of
values of companies and assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or

assets may actually be sold. Because such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, KBW assumed no responsibility or liability
for their accuracy.

KBW assumed, in all respects material to its analyses:
 

 

•  that the integrated mergers and any related transactions (including the bank merger) would be completed substantially in
accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement (the final terms of which KBW assumed would not differ in any
respect material to KBW’s analyses from the draft reviewed and referred to above) with no adjustments to the exchange ratio
and with no other consideration or payments in respect of the WashingtonFirst common stock;

 

 
•  that the representations and warranties of each party in the merger agreement and in all related documents and instruments

referred to in the merger agreement were true and correct;
 

 
•  that each party to the merger agreement and all related documents would perform all of the covenants and agreements

required to be performed by such party under such documents;
 

 

•  that there were no factors that would delay or subject to any adverse conditions any necessary regulatory or governmental
approval for the integrated mergers or any related transactions (including the subsidiary bank merger) and that all conditions
to the completion of the integrated mergers and any related transaction would be satisfied without any waivers or
modifications to the merger agreement or any of the related documents; and

 

 

•  that in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for the integrated mergers
and any related transaction (including the subsidiary bank merger), no restrictions, including any divestiture requirements,
termination or other payments or amendments or modifications, would be imposed that would have a material adverse effect
on the future results of operations or financial condition of WashingtonFirst, Sandy Spring or the pro forma entity, or the
contemplated benefits of the Transactions, including without limitation the cost savings and related expenses expected to
result or be derived from the Transactions.

KBW assumed that the integrated mergers would be consummated in a manner that complies with the applicable provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, as amended, and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules and
regulations. KBW was further advised by representatives of WashingtonFirst that WashingtonFirst relied upon advice from its advisors
(other than KBW) or other appropriate sources as to all legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and regulatory matters with respect to
WashingtonFirst, Sandy Spring, Merger Sub, the integrated mergers and any related transaction (including the subsidiary bank merger),
and the merger agreement. KBW did not provide advice with respect to any such matters.

KBW’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of the opinion, of the exchange ratio in
the first-step merger to the holders of WashingtonFirst common stock, without regard to differences between WashingtonFirst voting
common stock and WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock. KBW expressed no view or opinion as to any other terms or aspects of
the integrated mergers or any term or aspect of any related transaction (including the subsidiary bank merger), including without
limitation, the form or structure of the merger or any such related transaction, any consequences of the integrated mergers or any such
related transaction to WashingtonFirst, its stockholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects, merits or implications of any
employment, consulting, voting, support, stockholder or other agreements, arrangements or understandings contemplated or entered
into in connection with the integrated mergers or otherwise. KBW’s opinion was necessarily based upon conditions as they existed and
could be evaluated on the date of such opinion and the information made available to KBW through such date. Developments
subsequent to the date of KBW’s opinion may have affected, and may affect, the conclusion reached in KBW’s opinion and KBW did
not and does not have an obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. For purposes of its analyses, KBW did not

incorporate recently-announced proposed changes to United States tax laws regarding corporate tax rates. KBW’s opinion did not
address, and KBW expressed no view or opinion with respect to:
 

 •  the underlying business decision of WashingtonFirst to engage in the integrated mergers or enter into the merger agreement;
 

 
•  the relative merits of the integrated mergers as compared to any strategic alternatives that are, have been or may be available

to or contemplated by WashingtonFirst or the WashingtonFirst board;
 

 
•  the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of WashingtonFirst’s officers, directors or employees, or any

class of such persons, relative to the compensation to the holders of WashingtonFirst common stock;
 

 

•  the effect of the integrated mergers or any related transaction on, or the fairness of the consideration to be received by,
holders of any class of securities of WashingtonFirst (other than the holders of WashingtonFirst common stock solely with
respect to the exchange ratio, as described in KBW’s opinion and not relative to the consideration to be received by holders
of any other class of securities) or holders of any class of securities of Sandy Spring or any other party to any transaction
contemplated by the merger agreement;

 

 
•  the relative fairness of the exchange ratio as between holders of WashingtonFirst voting common stock and holders of

WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock;
 

 
•  any adjustment (as provided in the merger agreement) to the exchange ratio assumed for purposes of KBW’s opinion or any

other additional consideration (as provided in the merger agreement) that could be paid for WashingtonFirst common stock;
 

 •  the actual value of Sandy Spring common stock to be issued in the first-step merger;
 

 
•  the prices, trading range or volume at which WashingtonFirst voting common stock or Sandy Spring common stock would

trade following the public announcement of the integrated mergers or the prices, trading range or volume at which Sandy
Spring common stock would trade following the consummation of the integrated mergers;

 

 
•  any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to any of the parties to the integrated mergers or any other transaction

contemplated by the merger agreement; or
 

 

•  any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar matters relating to WashingtonFirst, Sandy Spring, their respective
stockholders, or relating to or arising out of or as a consequence of the integrated mergers or any related transaction
(including the subsidiary bank merger), including whether or not the integrated mergers would qualify as a tax-free
reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes.

In performing its analyses, KBW made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic,
market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of KBW, WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring. Any
estimates contained in the analyses performed by KBW are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be
significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Additionally, estimates of the value of businesses or securities do
not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might actually be sold. Accordingly, these
analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, the KBW opinion was among several factors taken
into consideration by the WashingtonFirst board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement and the Transactions.
Consequently, the analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the WashingtonFirst board with
respect to the fairness of the exchange ratio. The type and amount of consideration payable in the Transactions were determined
through negotiation between WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring and the decision of WashingtonFirst to enter into the merger
agreement was solely that of the WashingtonFirst board.

Table of Contents

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by KBW to the WashingtonFirst board in connection
with its opinion. The summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses underlying the opinion or the presentation made
by KBW to the WashingtonFirst board, but summarizes the material analyses performed and presented in connection with such
opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. The tables alone do not constitute a
complete description of the financial analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytic process involving various
determinations as to appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular
circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, KBW did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that it considered, but rather made qualitative judgments
as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, KBW believes that its analyses and the summary of its
analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on the information presented
below in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the full narrative description of the financial analyses,
including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process
underlying its analyses and opinion.

For purposes of the financial analyses described below, KBW utilized an implied transaction value for the proposed merger of
$36.50 per outstanding share of WashingtonFirst common stock based on the closing price of Sandy Spring common stock on May 12,
2017 and assuming each outstanding share of WashingtonFirst common stock will be converted into 0.8713 of a share of Sandy Spring
common stock in the proposed first-step merger.

WashingtonFirst Selected Companies Analysis. Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial
performance, financial condition and market performance of WashingtonFirst to 10 selected major exchange-traded banks and thrifts
headquartered in Maryland or Virginia with total assets between $1.25 billion and $5.0 billion and nonperforming assets to total assets
less than 3.00%. Targets of publicly announced merger transactions were excluded from the selected companies.

The selected companies were as follows:
 

Access National Corporation   First Community Bancshares, Inc.
American National Bankshares, Inc.   Old Line Bancshares, Inc.
C&F Financial Corporation   Shore Bancshares, Inc.
Community Bankers Trust Corporation   Southern National Bancorp of Virginia, Inc.
Community Financial Corporation   Xenith Bankshares, Inc.

To perform this analysis, KBW used profitability and other financial information for, as of, or, in the case of last twelve months
(“LTM”) information, through, the most recent completed quarter (“MRQ”) available (which was the fiscal quarter ended March 31,
2017, except as otherwise noted) and market price information as of May 12, 2017. KBW also used 2017 and 2018 earnings per share
(“EPS”) estimates taken from consensus “street estimates” of WashingtonFirst and the selected companies to the extent publicly
available (consensus “street” estimates were not publicly available for one of the selected companies). In addition, the assets, capital
ratios, loans to deposits ratio, market capitalization and price to tangible book value per share multiple of Access National Corporation,
Southern National Bancorp of Virginia, Inc., Old Line Bancshares, Inc. and Shore Bancshares, Inc. reflected the pro forma impact of
pending and recently completed acquisitions based on publicly available information. Certain financial data prepared by KBW, and as
referenced in the tables presented below, may not correspond to the data presented in WashingtonFirst’s historical financial statements,
or the data prepared by Sandler O’Neill presented under the section “—Opinion of Sandy Spring’s Financial Advisor,” as a result of the
different periods, assumptions and methods used by KBW to compute the financial data presented.

management, the market price to estimated 2018 EPS multiple of WashingtonFirst was 15.3x.

KBW also reviewed with the WashingtonFirst board of directors implied transaction multiples for the proposed merger, based on
the implied transaction value for the proposed merger of $36.50 per outstanding share of WashingtonFirst common stock, of 2.56x
WashingtonFirst’s tangible book value per share as of March 31, 2017, 25.9x WashingtonFirst’s LTM EPS, 24.1x WashingtonFirst’s
estimated 2017 EPS and 21.7x WashingtonFirst’s estimated 2018 EPS using consensus “street estimates” of WashingtonFirst, and
22.8x WashingtonFirst’s estimated 2017 EPS and 19.8x WashingtonFirst’s estimated 2018 EPS using financial and operating forecasts
and projections of WashingtonFirst provided by WashingtonFirst management.

No company used as a comparison in the above selected companies analysis is identical to WashingtonFirst. Accordingly, an
analysis of these results is not mathematical. Rather, it involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics of the companies involved.

Sandy Spring Selected Companies Analysis. Using publicly available information, KBW compared the financial performance,
financial condition and market performance of Sandy Spring to 11 selected major exchange-traded banks and thrifts headquartered in
Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia or West Virginia with total assets between $3.0 billion and $9.0 billion. Targets of publicly
announced merger transactions were excluded from the selected companies.

The selected companies were as follows:
 

Beneficial Bancorp, Inc.
Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation
City Holding Company
Eagle Bancorp, Inc.

To perform this analysis, KBW used profitability and other financial information for, as of, or, in the case of LTM information,
through, the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017 and market price information as of May 12, 2017. KBW also used 2017 and 2018
EPS estimates taken from consensus “street estimates” for Sandy Spring and the selected companies. In addition, the assets, capital
ratios, loans to deposits ratio, market capitalization and price to tangible book value per share multiple for First Commonwealth
Financial Corporation and Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation reflected the pro forma impact of pending and recently completed
acquisitions based on publicly available information. Certain financial data prepared by KBW, and as referenced in the tables presented
below, may not correspond to the data presented in Sandy Spring’s historical financial statements, or the data prepared by Sandler
O’Neill presented under the section “— Opinion of Sandy Spring’s Financial Advisor,” as a result of the different periods, assumptions

For each selected transaction, KBW derived the following implied transaction statistics, in each case based on the transaction
consideration value paid for the acquired company and using financial data based on the acquired company’s then latest publicly
available financial statements and, to the extent publicly available, consensus “street estimates” (except as otherwise indicated) prior to
the announcement of the respective transaction:
 

 
•  Price per common share to tangible book value per share of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions

involving a private acquired company, this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by
total tangible common equity);

 

 
•  Tangible equity premium to core deposits (total deposits less time deposits greater than $100,000) of the acquired company,

referred to as core deposit premium;
 

 
•  Price per common share to LTM EPS of the acquired company (in the case of selected transactions involving a private

acquired company, this transaction statistic was calculated as total transaction consideration divided by LTM earnings);
 

 

•  Price per common share to current year estimated EPS of the acquired company in the 18 selected transactions in which
consensus “street estimates” for the acquired company were then available (or, in the case of the Simmons First National
Corporation/First Texas BHC, Inc. transaction, where the current year’s earnings estimate for the acquired company was
provided in the investor presentation filed in conjunction with the announcement of that transaction).

statistics for the proposed Transactions based on the implied transaction value for the proposed Transactions of $36.50 per outstanding
share of WashingtonFirst common stock and using historical financial information for WashingtonFirst as of and for the twelve month

Relative Contribution Analysis. KBW analyzed the relative standalone contribution of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst to
various pro forma balance sheet and income statement items and the pro forma market capitalization of the combined entity. This
analysis did not include purchase accounting adjustments or cost savings. To perform this analysis, KBW used (i) balance sheet and net
income data for Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst as of or for the twelve month period ended March 31, 2017, (ii) 2017 and 2018 net
income consensus “street estimates” for Sandy Spring, as adjusted in the case of 2018 for current tax rates as provided by Sandy Spring
management, (iii) financial forecasts and projections relating to the net income of WashingtonFirst provided by WashingtonFirst
management, and (iv) market price data as of May 12, 2017. The results of KBW’s analysis are set forth in the following table, which
also compares the results of KBW’s analysis with the implied pro forma ownership percentages of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst
stockholders in the combined company assuming that each outstanding share of WashingtonFirst common stock will be converted into
0.8713 of a share of Sandy Spring common stock in the proposed Transactions:

WashingtonFirst Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. KBW performed a discounted cash flow analysis of WashingtonFirst to
estimate a range for the implied equity value of WashingtonFirst. In this analysis, KBW used financial forecasts and projections
relating to the net income and assets of WashingtonFirst provided by WashingtonFirst management, and assumed discount rates
ranging from 10.0% to 14.0%. The ranges of values were derived by adding (i) the present value of the estimated excess cash flows
that WashingtonFirst could generate over the period from December 31, 2017 through 2022 as a standalone company, and (ii) the
present value of WashingtonFirst’s implied terminal value at the end of such period. KBW assumed that WashingtonFirst would
maintain a tangible common equity to tangible asset ratio of 8.00% and would retain sufficient earnings to maintain that level. In
calculating the terminal value of WashingtonFirst, KBW applied a range of 14.0x to 18.0x estimated 2023 net income. This discounted
cash flow analysis resulted in a range of implied values per share of WashingtonFirst common stock of $24.30 to $36.16.

The discounted cash flow analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly
dependent on the assumptions that must be made, including asset and earnings growth rates, terminal values, dividend payout rates, and
discount rates. The foregoing discounted cash flow analyses did not purport to be indicative of the actual values of WashingtonFirst.

Forecasted Pro Forma Financial Impact Analysis. KBW performed a pro forma financial impact analysis that combined
projected income statement and balance sheet information of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst. Using (i) closing balance sheet
estimates as of December 31, 2017 for Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst, (ii) consensus “street estimates” of Sandy Spring for 2017
and 2018 (as adjusted in the case of 2018 for current tax rates as provided by Sandy Spring management) and assumed long-term
growth rates for Sandy Spring provided by Sandy Spring management, (iii) consensus “street estimates” of WashingtonFirst for 2017,
2018 and 2019 as discussed with KBW by Sandy Spring management, and (iv) pro forma assumptions (including the cost

savings and related expenses expected to result from the merger and purchase accounting and other adjustments assumed with respect
thereto) provided by Sandy Spring management, KBW analyzed the potential financial impact of the Transactions on certain projected
financial results of Sandy Spring. This analysis indicated the Transactions could be accretive to Sandy Spring’s 2018 estimated EPS
(excluding the impact of restructuring charges which may be realized during 2018) and 2019 estimated EPS and dilutive to Sandy
Spring’s estimated tangible book value per share as of December 31, 2017. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that, pro forma for the
Transactions, Sandy Spring’s leverage ratio and Total Risk Based Capital Ratio as of December 31, 2017 could be higher and each of
Sandy Spring’s tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio, Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio and Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio as of
December 31, 2017 could be lower. For all of the above analysis, the actual results achieved by Sandy Spring following the
Transactions may vary from the projected results, and the variations may be material.

Miscellaneous. KBW acted as financial advisor to WashingtonFirst and not as an advisor to or agent of any other person. As part
of its investment banking business, KBW is continually engaged in the valuation of bank and bank holding company securities in
connection with acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and
valuations for various other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking companies, KBW has experience in, and knowledge
of, the valuation of banking enterprises. In the ordinary course of its and their broker-dealer businesses, and in the case of
WashingtonFirst further to an existing sales and trading relationship with a KBW affiliate, KBW and its affiliates may from time to
time purchase securities from, and sell securities to, WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring. In addition, as a market maker in securities,
KBW and its affiliates may from time to time have a long or short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities of
WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring for its and their own accounts and for the accounts of its and their respective customers and clients.

Pursuant to the KBW engagement agreement, WashingtonFirst agreed to pay KBW a total cash fee equal to 1.0% of the aggregate
merger consideration, $250,000 of which became payable to KBW with the rendering of its opinion and the balance of which is
contingent upon the closing of the first-step merger. WashingtonFirst also agreed to reimburse KBW for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses and disbursements incurred in connection with its retention and to indemnify KBW against certain liabilities relating to or
arising out of KBW’s engagement or KBW’s role in connection therewith. In addition to this present engagement, during the two years
preceding the date of its opinion, KBW has provided investment banking and financial advisory services to WashingtonFirst and
received compensation for such services. KBW acted as an underwriter in connection with WashingtonFirst’s December 2015
registered offering of common stock. In addition, KBW acted as placement agent in connection with WashingtonFirst’s October 2015
private placement of subordinated debt securities. During the two years preceding the date of its opinion, KBW has not provided
investment banking or financial advisory services to Sandy Spring for which compensation was received. KBW provided investment
banking assistance to Sandy Spring in the two years preceding the date of its opinion in regard to a potential transaction that was
considered but not consummated by Sandy Spring, in connection with which KBW did not enter into an engagement agreement or
receive compensation. KBW may in the future provide investment banking and financial advisory services to WashingtonFirst or
Sandy Spring and receive compensation for such services.

Sandy Spring’s Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the Sandy Spring Board

After careful consideration, the Sandy Spring board, at a meeting held on May 15, 2017, unanimously approved the merger
agreement. Accordingly, the Sandy Spring board unanimously recommends that Sandy Spring stockholders vote “FOR” the Sandy
Spring share issuance.

In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the integrated mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, and to recommend that its stockholders approve the Sandy Spring share issuance, the Sandy Spring board evaluated
the merger agreement and the Transactions in consultation with Sandy Spring management, as well as Sandy Spring’s legal counsel
and financial advisors, and considered a

Table of Contents

number of factors in favor of the Transactions, including the following material factors, which are not presented in order of priority:
 

 
•  the fact that the Transactions are consistent with Sandy Spring’s long-term strategic goal of creating stockholder value by

being and remaining a preeminent community bank in the Washington, D.C. area, including through growth by acquisitions;
 

 
•  the fact that the Transactions are expected to create the largest locally-headquartered community bank in the Washington,

D.C. metropolitan area and bring together two well-known financial services brands in the local community;
 

 
•  the fact that WashingtonFirst is among the few, and most attractive, acquisition targets of scale in the Washington, D.C.

region;
 

 •  the unusually complementary branch footprints of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst;
 

 
•  the fact that the Transactions would respond immediately to Sandy Spring’s need for more scale in the attractive northern

Virginia market;
 

 
•  the complementary cultures of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst and prospects for a smooth integration of key personnel

and systems;
 

 
•  each of Sandy Spring’s and WashingtonFirst’s businesses, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects, including

the view of the Sandy Spring board that WashingtonFirst’s business and operations complement Sandy Spring’s existing
operations and lines of business;

 

 •  the nature and quality of WashingtonFirst’s loan portfolio and deposit base;
 

 •  the fact that the Transactions will enhance Sandy Spring’s operating scale at reasonable pricing;
 

 
•  the current and prospective environment in which Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst operate, including national, regional

and local economic conditions, the competitive environment for financial institutions generally and the likely effect of these
factors on Sandy Spring both with and without the Transactions;

 

 
•  its review and discussions with Sandy Spring’s management and its legal counsel and financial advisors concerning the due

diligence investigation of WashingtonFirst and the potential financial impact of the Transactions on the combined company;
 

 •  management’s expectation that Sandy Spring will retain its strong capital position upon completion of the Transactions;
 

 

•  the financial presentation, dated May 15, 2017, of Sandler O’Neill to the Sandy Spring board and the opinion, dated May 15,
2017, of Sandler O’Neill to the Sandy Spring board as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the
opinion, to Sandy Spring of the merger consideration, as more fully described below under the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “— Opinion of Sandy Spring’s Financial Advisor;”

 

 
•  the terms of the merger agreement, including the expected tax treatment and deal protection and termination fee provisions,

which it reviewed with Sandy Spring’s outside legal and financial advisors; and
 

 
•  the regulatory and other approvals required in connection with the Transactions and the expectation that such regulatory and

other approvals will be received in a timely manner and without the imposition of unacceptable conditions.

The Sandy Spring board also considered potential risks associated with the Transactions in connection with its deliberations of the
Transactions, including (i) the potential risk of diverting management attention and resources from the operation of Sandy Spring’s
business and towards the completion of the Transactions; (ii) the

potential risks associated with achieving anticipated cost synergies and savings and successfully integrating WashingtonFirst’s
business, operations and workforce with those of Sandy Spring; and (iii) the other risks identified in the sections of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 26 and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements” beginning on page 32.

The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by the Sandy Spring board is not intended to be exhaustive, but, rather,
includes the material factors considered by the Sandy Spring board. In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the
integrated mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Sandy Spring board did not quantify or
assign any relative weights to the factors considered, and individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The
Sandy Spring board considered all these factors as a whole and overall considered the factors to be favorable to, and to support, its
determination. It should be noted that this explanation of the Sandy Spring board’s reasoning and all other information presented in this
section is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed under the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 32.

For the reasons set forth above, the Sandy Spring approved the merger agreement. The Sandy Spring board unanimously
recommends that the Sandy Spring stockholders vote “FOR” the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal and “FOR” the Sandy Spring
adjournment proposal.

Opinion of Sandy Spring’s Financial Advisor

By letter dated March 27, 2017 Sandy Spring retained Sandler O’Neill to render a fairness opinion to the Sandy Spring board in
connection with Sandy Spring’s consideration of a possible business combination with WashingtonFirst. Sandler O’Neill is a nationally
recognized investment banking firm whose principal business specialty is financial institutions. In the ordinary course of its investment
banking business, Sandler O’Neill is regularly engaged in the valuation of financial institutions and their securities in connection with
mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions.

Sandler O’Neill rendered a fairness opinion in connection with the proposed Transactions. At the May 15, 2017 meeting at which
the Sandy Spring board considered and approved the merger agreement, Sandler O’Neill delivered to the Sandy Spring board its oral
opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the effect that, as of such date, the exchange ratio provided for in the
Transactions was fair to Sandy Spring from a financial point of view.

The full text of Sandler O’Neill’s opinion is attached as Annex F to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The opinion
outlines the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken by Sandler O’Neill in rendering its opinion. The description of the opinion set forth below is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of the opinion. Sandy Spring stockholders are urged to read the entire opinion carefully in
connection with their consideration of the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal.

Sandler O’Neill’s opinion speaks only as of the date of the opinion. The opinion was directed to the Sandy Spring board in
connection with its consideration of the merger and is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
exchange ratio to Sandy Spring. Sandler O’Neill’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any Sandy Spring
stockholder as to how such Sandy Spring stockholder should vote at any meeting of stockholders called to consider and vote
upon the Sandy Spring share issuance proposal. It does not address the underlying business decision of Sandy Spring to engage
in the Transactions, the form or structure of the Transactions, the relative merits of the Transactions as compared to any other
alternative business strategies that might exist for Sandy Spring or the effect of any other transaction in which Sandy Spring
might engage. Sandler O’Neill did not express any opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to be
received in the Transactions by any Sandy Spring or

WashingtonFirst officers, directors, or employees, or class of such persons, relative to the compensation to be received in the
Transactions by any other stockholders. Sandler O’Neill’s opinion was approved by Sandler O’Neill’s fairness opinion committee.

In connection with rendering its opinion, Sandler O’Neill reviewed and considered, among other things:
 

 •  an execution version of the merger agreement, dated May 15, 2017;
 

 
•  certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of Sandy Spring and its bank

subsidiary that Sandler O’Neill deemed relevant;
 

 
•  certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of WashingtonFirst and its bank

subsidiary that Sandler O’Neill deemed relevant;
 

 
•  publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for Sandy Spring for the years ending December 31, 2017

and December 31, 2018, as well as estimated dividends per share and long term earnings per share and asset growth rates for
the years thereafter, as discussed with and confirmed by the senior management of Sandy Spring;

 

 
•  publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for WashingtonFirst for the years ending December 31,

2017 and December 31, 2018, as well as estimated dividends per share and long term earnings per share and asset growth
rates for the years thereafter, as discussed with and confirmed by the senior management of WashingtonFirst;

 

 
•  the pro forma financial impact of the Transactions on Sandy Spring based on certain assumptions relating to transaction

expenses, purchase accounting adjustments and cost savings, as provided by the senior management of Sandy Spring;
 

 

•  the publicly reported historical price and trading activity for Sandy Spring common stock and WashingtonFirst common
stock, including a comparison of certain stock trading information for Sandy Spring common stock, WashingtonFirst
common stock and certain stock indices as well as publicly available information for certain other similar companies the
securities of which are publicly traded;

 

 
•  a comparison of certain financial information for Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst with similar bank and thrift institutions

for which information is publicly available;
 

 
•  the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the bank and thrift industry (on a regional and nationwide

basis), to the extent publicly available;
 

 •  the current market environment generally and the banking environment in particular; and
 

 
•  such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and market criteria as Sandler

O’Neill considered relevant.

Sandler O’Neill also discussed with certain members of the senior management of Sandy Spring the business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects of Sandy Spring and held similar discussions with the senior management of WashingtonFirst and
their representatives regarding the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of WashingtonFirst.

In preparing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill used publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for Sandy Spring
for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, as well as estimated dividends per share and long term earnings per
share and asset growth rates for the years thereafter, as discussed with and confirmed by the senior management of Sandy Spring. In
addition, in preparing its analyses Sandler O’Neill used publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for
WashingtonFirst for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, as well as estimated dividends per share and long
term earnings per share and asset growth rates for the years thereafter, as discussed with and confirmed by the senior management of
WashingtonFirst. Sandler O’Neill also received and used in its pro forma analyses certain

assumptions relating to transaction expenses, purchase accounting adjustments and cost savings, as provided by the senior management
of Sandy Spring. With respect to the foregoing information, the respective managements of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst
confirmed to Sandler O’Neill that such information reflected (or, in the case of the publicly available consensus analyst earnings per
share estimates referred to above, were consistent with) the best currently available estimates and judgments of those respective
managements of the future financial performance of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst, respectively, and Sandler O’Neill assumed that
such performance would be achieved. Sandler O’Neill expressed no opinion as to such information, or the assumptions on which such
information was based. Sandler O’Neill also assumed that there had been no material change in Sandy Spring’s or WashingtonFirst’s
assets, financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects since the date of the most recent financial statements made
available to Sandler O’Neill. Sandler O’Neill assumed in all respects material its analysis that Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst
would remain as going concerns for all periods relevant to Sandler O’Neill’s analyses.

Sandler O’Neill also assumed, with Sandy Spring’s consent, in all respects material to its analysis, that (i) each of the parties to
the merger agreement will comply in all material respects with all material terms and conditions of the merger agreement and all
related agreements, that all of the representations and warranties contained in such agreements are true and correct in all material
respects, that each of the parties to such agreements will perform in all material respects all of the covenants and other obligations
required to be performed by such party under such agreements and that the conditions precedent in such agreements were not and will
not be waived, (ii) in the course of obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases with respect to the
Transactions, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Sandy Spring,
WashingtonFirst or the Transactions or any related transaction, (iii) the Transactions and any related transaction will be consummated
in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement without any waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition
or agreement thereof and in compliance with all applicable laws and other requirements, and (iv) the Transactions will qualify as a tax-
free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. Sandler O’Neill expressed no opinion as to any of the legal, accounting or tax
matters relating to the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated in connection therewith.

Sandler O’Neill’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the
information made available to Sandler O’Neill as of, the date thereof. Events occurring after the date thereof could materially affect
Sandler O’Neill’s opinion. Sandler O’Neill has not undertaken to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw its opinion or otherwise
comment upon events occurring after the date thereof. Sandler O’Neill expressed no opinion as to the trading values of Sandy Spring
common stock or WashingtonFirst common stock at any time or what the value of Sandy Spring common stock will be once it is
actually received by the holders of WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock.

In performing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business,
economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, which are beyond the control of Sandler O’Neill, Sandy Spring and
WashingtonFirst. Any estimates contained in the analyses performed by Sandler O’Neill are not necessarily indicative of actual values
or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses. Additionally, estimates of the
values of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which such businesses or securities might
actually be sold. Accordingly, these analyses and estimates are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. In addition, Sandler
O’Neill’s opinion was among several factors taken into consideration by the Sandy Spring board in making its determination to
approve the merger agreement and the merger. Consequently, the analyses described below should not be viewed as determinative of
the decision of the Sandy Spring board with respect to the fairness of the exchange ratio. The type and amount of consideration payable
in the merger were determined through negotiation between Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst and the decision to enter into the
merger agreement was solely that of the Sandy Spring board.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Sandler O’Neill to the Sandy Spring board in
connection with its opinion. The summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses

underlying the opinion or the presentation made by Sandler O’Neill to the Sandy Spring board, but summarizes the material analyses
performed and presented in connection with such opinion. The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in
tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, these tables must be read together with the accompanying
text. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a
complex analytic process involving various determinations as to appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a fairness opinion is not readily susceptible to partial analysis
or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Sandler O’Neill did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor that
it considered, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly,
Sandler O’Neill believes that its analyses and the summary of its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of
its analyses and factors or focusing on the information presented below in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors
or the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion.

Summary of Proposed Merger Consideration and Implied Transaction Metrics

Sandler O’Neill reviewed the financial terms of the proposed Transactions. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, at the
effective time of the first-step merger, by virtue of the first-step merger, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, each share of WashingtonFirst common stock and each share of WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock that is issued and
outstanding at the effective time, except for the excluded shares, shall become and be converted into the number of shares of Sandy
Spring common stock as follows: (i) if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is greater than $53.23, the exchange ratio
shall equal 0.8210; (ii) if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is greater than $50.15 and equal to or less than $53.23, the
exchange ratio shall equal the quotient of $43.70 divided by the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price; (iii) if the Sandy Spring
volume-weighted average price is equal to or greater than $37.07 and equal to or less than $50.15, the exchange ratio shall equal
0.8713; (iv) if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is equal to or greater than $34.00 and less than $37.07, the exchange
ratio shall be equal to the quotient of $32.30 divided by the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price; and (v) if the Sandy Spring
volume-weighted average price is less than $34.00, the exchange ratio shall equal 0.9500. Using Sandy Spring’s May 12, 2017 closing
stock price of $41.89, an implied exchange ratio of 0.8713, and based upon the following (as provided by WashingtonFirst
management), (a) 13,055,408 shares of WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock outstanding,
and (b) 570,303 outstanding WashingtonFirst options with a weighted average strike price of $14.77, Sandler O’Neill calculated an
implied transaction value per share of $36.50 and an aggregate implied transaction value of approximately $488.9 million.

Sandler O’Neill calculated the following implied transaction metrics:
 

Transaction Price / Last Twelve Months (“LTM”) Ended March 31, 2017 Earnings Per Share    25.9x 
Transaction Price / 2017 Median Analyst Estimated Earnings Per Share    24.0x

Net Present Value Analyses

Sandler O’Neill performed an analysis that estimated the net present value per share of Sandy Spring’s common stock, assuming
Sandy Spring performed in accordance with publicly available analyst consensus earnings per share estimates for Sandy Spring for the
years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, and earnings per share estimates for the years ending December 31,
2019, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021 calculated based on an estimated long-term earnings per share growth rate of 8.0%,
which growth rate was discussed and confirmed with the senior management of Sandy Spring. To approximate the terminal value of
Sandy Spring common stock at December 31, 2021, Sandler O’Neill applied price to 2021 earnings multiples ranging from 17.0x to
24.5x and multiples of December 31, 2021 tangible book value ranging from 165% to 275%. The terminal values were then discounted
to present values using different discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 13.0%, which were chosen to reflect different assumptions
regarding required rates of return of holders or prospective buyers of Sandy Spring common stock. As illustrated in the following
tables, the analysis indicated an imputed range of values per share of Sandy Spring common stock of $34.79 to $57.06 when applying
multiples of earnings and $29.18 to $54.19 when applying multiples of tangible book value.

Sandler O’Neill also considered and discussed with the Sandy Spring board of directors how this analysis would be affected by
changes in the underlying assumptions, including variations with respect to net income. To illustrate this impact, Sandler O’Neill
performed a similar analysis, assuming Sandy Spring’s net income varied from 20% above estimates to 20% below estimates. This
analysis resulted in the following range of per share values for Sandy Spring common stock, applying the price to 2021 earnings
referred to above and a discount rate of 10.74%.

Sandler O’Neill also performed two analyses that estimated the net present value per share of WashingtonFirst common stock
under various circumstances. The first analysis assumed WashingtonFirst performed in accordance with publicly available analyst
consensus estimates for WashingtonFirst for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, and earnings per share
estimates for the years ending December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021 calculated based on an estimated long-
term earnings per share growth rate of 10.5%, which growth rate was discussed and confirmed with the senior management of Sandy
Spring (which we refer to as the “WashingtonFirst Stand Alone NPV Analysis” in this section). For the second analysis, Sandler
O’Neill used the same assumptions as the WashingtonFirst Stand Alone NPV Analysis, but also included assumptions related to after-
tax cost savings, as provided by the senior management of Sandy Spring (which we refer to as the “WashingtonFirst Adjusted NPV
Analysis” in this section).

For both the WashingtonFirst Stand Alone NPV Analysis and WashingtonFirst Adjusted NPV Analysis, to approximate the
terminal value of WashingtonFirst common stock at December 31, 2021, Sandler O’Neill applied price to 2021 earnings multiples
ranging from 16.0x to 22.0x and multiples of December 31, 2021 tangible book value ranging from 160% to 215%. The terminal
values were then discounted to present values using different discount rates ranging from 10.0% to 14.0%, which were chosen to
reflect different assumptions regarding required rates of return of holders or prospective buyers of WashingtonFirst common stock. As
illustrated in the following tables, the WashingtonFirst Stand Alone NPV Analysis indicated an imputed range of values per share of
WashingtonFirst common stock of $20.72 to $33.11 when applying multiples of earnings and the WashingtonFirst Adjusted NPV
Analysis indicated an imputed range of values per share of WashingtonFirst common stock of $33.25 to $53.53 when applying
multiples of earnings. In addition, as illustrated in the following tables, the WashingtonFirst Stand Alone NPV Analysis indicated an
imputed range of values per share of WashingtonFirst common stock of $19.89 to $31.07 when applying multiples of tangible book
value and the WashingtonFirst Adjusted NPV Analysis indicated an imputed range of values per share of WashingtonFirst common
stock of $23.59 to $36.96 when applying multiples of tangible book value.

In connection with its analyses, Sandler O’Neill considered and discussed with the Sandy Spring board of directors how the
present value analyses would be affected by changes in the underlying assumptions. Sandler O’Neill noted that the net present value
analysis is a widely used valuation methodology, but the results of such methodology are highly dependent upon the numerous
assumptions that must be made, and the results thereof are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results.

Pro Forma Merger Analysis

Sandler O’Neill analyzed certain potential pro forma effects of the Transactions on Sandy Spring assuming the Transactions close
at the end of the fourth calendar quarter of 2017. Sandler O’Neill utilized the following information and assumptions: (i) publicly
available mean analyst earnings per share estimates for Sandy Spring for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018,
and estimated long-term annual asset and

earnings per share growth rates, and dividends per share for the years thereafter, as discussed and confirmed with the senior
management of Sandy Spring, (ii) publicly available mean analyst earnings per share estimates for WashingtonFirst for the years
ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, and estimated long-term annual asset and earnings per share growth rates, and
dividends per share for the years thereafter, as discussed and confirmed with the senior management of Sandy Spring, and (iii) certain
assumptions related to transaction expenses, purchase accounting adjustments, as well as certain cost savings assumptions, as provided
by the senior management of Sandy Spring. The analysis indicated that the Transactions could be accretive to Sandy Spring’s earnings
per share (excluding one-time transaction costs and expenses) in the years ending December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 and
dilutive to Sandy Spring’s estimated tangible book value per share at close.

In connection with this analysis, Sandler O’Neill considered and discussed with the Sandy Spring board how the analysis would
be affected by changes in the underlying assumptions and noted that the actual results achieved by the combined company may vary
from projected results and the variations may be material.

Sandler O’Neill’s Relationship

Sandler O’Neill received a fee for rendering its opinion in an amount equal to $600,000, which fee was due and payable at the
time the written opinion was delivered. Sandy Spring has also agreed to indemnify Sandler O’Neill against certain claims and liabilities
arising out of Sandler O’Neill’s engagement and to reimburse Sandler O’Neill for certain of its out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with Sandler O’Neill’s engagement. Sandler O’Neill did not provide any other investment banking services to Sandy Spring
in the two years preceding the date of its opinion. As Sandler O’Neill previously advised Sandy Spring, in the two years preceding the
date of Sandler O’Neill’s opinion, Sandler O’Neill provided certain investment banking services to, and received investment banking
fees from, WashingtonFirst. Most recently, Sandler O’Neill acted as placement agent in connection with the offer and sale of
WashingtonFirst’s subordinated debt securities in October 2015 and as financial advisor to the board of directors of WashingtonFirst in
connection with WashingtonFirst’s acquisition of 1st Portfolio Holding Corporation, which transaction closed in July 2015. In the
ordinary course of Sandler O’Neill’s business as a broker-dealer, Sandler O’Neill may purchase securities from and sell securities to
Sandy Spring, WashingtonFirst and their respective affiliates. Sandler O’Neill may also actively trade the equity and debt securities of
Sandy Spring, WashingtonFirst or their respective affiliates for its own account and for the accounts of its customers.

Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information

Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst do not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance due to, among
other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the uncertainty of underlying
assumptions and estimates. However, Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst are including in this joint proxy statement/prospectus certain
limited unaudited financial information for Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst on a standalone basis, without giving effect to the
mergers or the bank merger, which was discussed with Sandler O’Neill, KBW and the other party in connection with the merger.

Specifically, for purposes of the financial analyses performed in connection with Sandler O’Neill’s opinion, WashingtonFirst
discussed with Sandler O’Neill, and Sandler O’Neill used, publicly available consensus “street estimates” as of May 12, 2017 of
WashingtonFirst’s earnings per share for 2017 and for 2018. For purposes of these financial analyses, WashingtonFirst management
also provided to and discussed with Sandler O’Neill an estimated annual earnings growth rate of 10.5% per year for beyond 2018.
Taking into account these earnings per share estimates, estimated tangible book value per share for WashingtonFirst at December 31,
2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 were also extrapolated from WashingtonFirst’s historical tangible book value per share at
December 31, 2016 for purposes of the financial analyses performed in connection with Sandler O’Neill’s opinion. The following table

the years ended December 31, 2017 through 2021 and unaudited prospective tangible book value per share estimates at December 31,

KBW also used the publicly available consensus “street estimates” of WashingtonFirst’s earnings per share for 2017 and 2018, as
well as a publicly available research analyst’s “street estimate” of WashingtonFirst’s earnings per share for 2019 of $1.85, for purposes
of the “Forecasted Pro Forma Financial Impact Analysis” and certain other financial analyses performed in connection with KBW’s
opinion. In addition, WashingtonFirst provided KBW with, and KBW used for purposes of the “Relative Contribution Analysis,” the
“WashingtonFirst Discounted Cash Flow Analysis” and certain other financial analyses performed in connection with KBW’s opinion,
WashingtonFirst management’s internal financial forecasts and projections consisting of (1) estimated earnings per diluted share of
$1.60 for 2017 and $1.84 for 2018, and (2) an assumed earnings per share growth rate of 10.0% per year for 2019 through 2023.

In addition, for purposes of the financial analyses performed in connection with Sandler O’Neill’s and KBW’s opinions, Sandy
Spring discussed with Sandler O’Neill and KBW, and Sandler O’Neill and KBW used, publicly available consensus “street estimates”
as of May 12, 2017 of Sandy Spring’s earnings per share for 2017 and for 2018 (adjusted, in the case of 2018, to eliminate the impact
of proposed changes in corporate income tax rates). For purposes of these financial analysis, Sandy Spring management also provided
to and discussed with Sandler O’Neill and KBW an estimated annual earnings growth rate of 8% per year for beyond 2018. Taking into
account these earnings per share estimates, estimated tangible book value per share for Sandy Spring at December 31, 2017, 2018,
2019, 2020 and 2021 were also extrapolated from Sandy Spring’s historical tangible book value per share at December 31, 2016 for
purposes of the financial analyses performed in connection with Sandler O’Neill’s opinion. The following table presents unaudited
prospective earnings per share estimates for Sandy Spring for the years ended December 31, 2017 through 2021 and unaudited
prospective tangible book value per share estimates at December 31, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 used by Sandler O’Neill as
described above.
 
   Year Ended December 31,

(1) Reflected the median consensus “street estimate.” KBW used the mean consensus “street estimate” of $2.41.

The inclusion of any unaudited prospective financial information for Sandy Spring or WashingtonFirst, including “street
estimates”, should not be regarded as an indication that any of Sandy Spring, WashingtonFirst, Sandler O’Neill, KBW, their respective
representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be necessarily predictive of actual future
results, and it should not be relied on as such. This information was prepared solely for internal use and is subjective in many respects.
While presented with numeric specificity, the unaudited prospective financial information reflects numerous estimates and assumptions
made with respect to business, economic, market, competition, regulatory and financial conditions and matters specific to Sandy
Spring’s and WashingtonFirst’s respective businesses, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond Sandy
Spring’s and WashingtonFirst’s control.

The unaudited prospective financial information reflects both assumptions as to certain business decisions that are subject to
change and, in many respects, subjective judgment, and thus is susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on
actual experience and business developments. Neither Sandy

Spring nor WashingtonFirst can give any assurance that the unaudited prospective financial information and the underlying estimates
and assumptions will be realized. In addition, since the unaudited prospective financial information covers multiple years, such
information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth
above, and important factors that may affect actual results and cause the unaudited prospective financial information to be inaccurate
include risks and uncertainties relating to Sandy Spring’s and WashingtonFirst’s respective businesses, industry performance, general

uncertainties inherent in any forecasted information, Sandy Spring stockholders and WashingtonFirst stockholders are cautioned not to
place unwarranted reliance on such information, and Sandy Spring stockholders and WashingtonFirst stockholders are urged to review
Sandy Spring’s most recent SEC filings for a description of Sandy Spring’s reported financial results and the financial statements of
Sandy Spring included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and WashingtonFirst’s most recent SEC filings for a description of
WashingtonFirst’s reported financial results and the financial statements of WashingtonFirst included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 150.

Interests of Certain WashingtonFirst Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions

In considering the recommendation of the WashingtonFirst board that you vote to approve the merger agreement, you should be
aware that WashingtonFirst’s directors and executive officers have interests in the Transactions that are different from, or in addition to,
those of WashingtonFirst’s stockholders generally. The WashingtonFirst board was aware of and considered those interests, among
other matters, in reaching its decisions to (i) approve and adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and
(ii) resolve to recommend the approval of the merger agreement to WashingtonFirst stockholders. WashingtonFirst’s stockholders
should take these interests into account in deciding whether to vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger agreement. These
interests are described in more detail below.

Treatment of WashingtonFirst Equity-Based Awards

Restricted Stock Awards: At the effective time, each restricted stock award granted by WashingtonFirst will become fully vested
and each holder of such restricted stock awards will be entitled to receive the per share merger consideration for each share of
WashingtonFirst common stock held by such holder. It is currently estimated that Ms. Andersen and Messrs. Connors, Horn, Johnson
and Bracewell will vest in 3,420 shares, 818 shares, 818 shares, 1,024 shares, and 1,710 shares, respectively, under their outstanding
restricted stock awards in connection with the consummation of the Transactions.

Stock Options: Also at the effective time, all outstanding and unexercised options to purchase shares of WashingtonFirst common
stock will be canceled and will be cashed out for an amount equal to the value of the per share merger consideration less the option
exercise price, assuming for purposes of this calculation that all such options were 100% vested as of the effective time. The value of
the per share merger consideration for this purpose will be the exchange ratio multiplied by the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average
price. It is currently estimated that Ms. Andersen and Messrs. Connors, Horn, Johnson, Rebibo, and Bracewell will be entitled to
receive a cash payment of $4,323,723, $1,416,685, $190,868, $776,789, $117,565 and $278,047, respectively, for their outstanding
stock options in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, assuming an exchange ratio of 0.8713 per share and a Sandy
Spring volume-weighted average price of $38.67 per share. The actual cash benefit may differ based upon the number of options that
remain outstanding as of the effective date, the exercise price of such outstanding options and the value of the per share merger
consideration.

Employment Agreement between WashingtonFirst Bank and Shaza L. Andersen

WashingtonFirst Bank maintains an employment agreement with Shaza L. Andersen, its President and Chief Executive Officer. In
the event Ms. Andersen terminates her employment in connection with a change of control (as defined in the employment agreement)
and is no longer employed by a successor or assign of WashingtonFirst Bank after such change of control, Ms. Andersen will be
entitled to receive a severance payment in a lump sum equal to three times her annual salary then in effect, one year of continued group
medical and other health insurance at WashingtonFirst Bank’s expense for Ms. Andersen and her immediate family, and full vesting of
any outstanding stock options. Ms. Andersen’s employment agreement also would entitle her to a tax gross-up payment for any
severance or other payments that may subject her to an excise tax under Section 280G of the Code.

Ms. Andersen’s current base salary is $606,236 and it is currently estimated that she will be entitled to receive a cash severance
payment totaling $1,818,708 and continued health benefits with an estimated value of

Table of Contents

$30,966 under her employment agreement in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and her termination of
employment. It is not anticipated that Ms. Anderson will receive a tax gross-up payment. It is currently anticipated that Ms. Andersen
will terminate her employment on the effective date of the merger.

Ms. Andersen’s employment agreement also contains noncompetition restrictions pursuant to which she has agreed not to engage
in a competing business (as defined in the employment agreement) in the greater Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area or any other city
or county outside of the greater Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area where WashingtonFirst Bank has an office on the date of
Ms. Andersen’s termination of employment with WashingtonFirst Bank. The noncompetition obligation extends for a period of twelve
months after her termination date.

Employment Agreement between WashingtonFirst Bank and Michael J. Rebibo

WashingtonFirst Bank maintains an employment agreement with Michael J. Rebibo, its Executive Vice President and President of
1st Portfolio Wealth Advisors and WashingtonFirst Mortgage. Under the employment agreement, if, after a change of control (as
defined in the employment agreement), Mr. Rebibo’s employment is terminated for good reason (as defined in the employment
agreement) or by WashingtonFirst Bank without cause, Ms. Rebibo will be entitled to receive monthly severance payments equal to
one-twelfth of his base salary for each month remaining in the initial term (August 1, 2018) plus an additional 24 months.

Mr. Rebibo’s current base salary is $330,000 and it is currently estimated that he would be entitled to receive severance payments
totaling $880,000 under his employment agreement in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and his termination of
employment.

Mr. Rebibo’s employment agreement also contains noncompetition restrictions pursuant to which he has agreed not to engage in a
competing business (as defined in the employment agreement) in the greater Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area or any other city or
county outside of the greater Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area where WashingtonFirst Bank has an office on the date of
Mr. Rebibo’s termination of employment with WashingtonFirst Bank. The noncompetition obligation extends for a period of
(i) twenty-four months after the termination date, if such termination occurs the initial term, (ii) twelve months after the termination
date, if such termination occurs during the renewal period (as defined in the employment agreement and generally two years after the
expiration of the initial three-year term) and (iii) six months after the termination date, if such termination occurs during the renewal
period and after a change in control.

The payments to be made under Mr. Rebibo’s employment agreement are subject to a limitation that the total amount of all
payments to the officer that would constitute a “parachute payment” (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) shall be reduced so that
no portion of such payments to the executive would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code.

Severance Payment Agreements between WashingtonFirst and George W. Connors, IV, Richard D. Horn, and Matthew R. Johnson

WashingtonFirst Bank maintains a severance payment agreement with George W. Connors, IV, President and Chief Credit Officer
of WashingtonFirst Bank, Richard D. Horn, General Counsel of WashingtonFirst Bank, and Matthew R. Johnson, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of WashingtonFirst Bank. Under the severance payment agreements, upon a covered termination
(as defined in the agreement), the executive is entitled to receive (i) all accrued and unpaid salary, bonuses, vacation and other amounts
earned or otherwise due through the termination date, (ii) a lump sum payment equal to two years’ salary and (iii) contributions toward
continued health insurance until twelve months pass, continuation coverage expires under federal law or the executive is eligible for
comparable insurance as a result of new employment or self-employment, whichever occurs first. In addition, all of the executive’s
outstanding equity awards will immediately vest upon a covered termination or if, in the event of a change of control (as defined in the
severance payment agreement), the

Table of Contents

acquiring, surviving or successor entity does not assume, continue or substitute the executive’s unvested outstanding equity awards,
whether or not his employment is terminated as a result of the change of control.

A covered termination occurs if, after a change of control, the executive’s employment with WashingtonFirst Bank is terminated
(i) by WashingtonFirst Bank or its successor, other than for cause, disability (each as defined in the severance payment agreement) or
death, on or within three years after the change of control, (ii) by the executive for good reason (as defined in the severance payment
agreement) within three years after the change of control or (iii) by the executive, for any reason other than death or disability, during
the period beginning ninety days after the change of control and ending three years after the change of control. The payments to be
made under each severance payment agreement are subject to a limitation that the total amount of all payments to the officer that would
constitute a “parachute payment” (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) shall be reduced so that no portion of such payments to the
executive would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, unless the executive would be better off (on an
after-tax basis) receiving all payments and benefits (without reduction) and paying all excise and applicable federal, state, and local
employment and income taxes (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate) (a “Modified 280G Cutback”). To the extent the
executive is subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, WashingtonFirst will lose its corporate deduction for a
portion of the severance payment. The severance payment agreements do not contain post-employment noncompetition restrictions.

Messrs. Connors,’ Horn’s, and Johnson’s current base salary is $357,674, $341,630, and $315,000, respectively, and it is currently
estimated that Messrs. Connors, Horn, and Johnson will be entitled to receive a cash severance payment totaling $715,348, $683,260,
and $630,000, respectively, and COBRA payments for continued health benefits with an estimated value of $30,966, $30,966, and $0,
respectively, under their respective severance payment agreements in connection with the consummation of the Transactions and a
covered termination of employment.

As described below in “— Agreements with Sandy Spring,” it is anticipated that Mr. Connors will enter into arrangements with
Sandy Spring effective as of the effective time of the first-step merger that will provide for certain payments in lieu of the lump sum
cash payment under his severance payment agreement and set forth his new position at Sandy Spring following the effective time of
the first-step merger.

Modified 280G Cutback Agreement with Joseph S. Bracewell

Before the effective date, it is anticipated that Mr. Bracewell will enter into a Modified 280G Cutback agreement with
WashingtonFirst. Under such agreement, the total amount of all payments to Mr. Bracewell in connection with the Transactions that
would constitute a “parachute payment” (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) shall be reduced so that no portion of such payments
to the executive would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, unless the executive would be better off (on
an after-tax basis) receiving all payments and benefits (without reduction) and paying all excise and applicable federal, state, and local
employment and income taxes (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate). To the extent Mr. Bracewell is subject to the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, WashingtonFirst will lose its corporate deduction for a portion of such payments.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Agreements between WashingtonFirst Bank and Certain of its Directors and Executive
Officers

WashingtonFirst Bank has entered into supplemental executive retirement agreements with Ms. Andersen and Messrs. Connors,
Horn, Johnson and Bracewell. The supplemental executive retirement agreements are intended to provide benefits to these directors
and executive officers upon retirement, death, disability or voluntary or involuntary separation from service (other than for “cause”),
subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Pursuant to the supplemental executive retirement agreements, if
Ms. Andersen or Messrs. Connors, Horn, Johnson or Bracewell is terminated following a change in control of WashingtonFirst

Bank, as defined in the supplemental executive retirement agreements, his or her full retirement benefit vests immediately and becomes
payable, at his or her election (irrevocably made at the time of execution of the supplemental executive retirement agreement) in a
lump sum occurring six months following separation from service or in monthly installments commencing at age 65 (or age 75 for
Mr. Bracewell).

It is currently estimated that Ms. Andersen and Messrs. Connors, Horn, and Johnson will be entitled to receive lump sum cash
benefits of $966,922, $674,557, $564,779, and $520,964, respectively, with Mr. Bracewell entitled to receive 120 monthly installments
beginning at age 75 in the amount of $9,851 per month, under their supplemental executive retirement agreements in connection with
the consummation of the Transactions.

Agreements with Sandy Spring

It is anticipated that Ms. Andersen will enter into a consulting and separation agreement with Sandy Spring that will set forth Ms.
Andersen’s entitlements and continuing obligations in connection with her termination of employment with WashingtonFirst and
WashingtonFirst Bank following the effective time of the first-step merger and her service as a non-employee director of and consultant
to Sandy Spring. It is also anticipated that Mr. Connors will enter into a bonus award and release agreement that will provide for certain
payments in lieu of the lump sum cash payment under his severance payment agreement and an employment agreement with Sandy
Spring that will set forth his new position at Sandy Spring following the effective time of the first-step merger. All arrangements
entered into with Sandy Spring will be effective as of the effective time of the first-step merger.

Consulting and separation Agreement — Ms. Andersen. The consulting and separation agreement will provide for a consulting
term of 12 months and a consulting fee of $18,333.33 per month. During the consulting period, Sandy Spring anticipates that Ms.
Andersen will provide services and advice regarding integration and transition planning related to the integrated mergers. The
agreement also provides that Ms. Andersen will be named the Vice Chairman of the board of directors of Sandy Spring Bank and a
member of the executive committee of the board of directors. It is intended that Ms. Andersen’s services will not exceed 20% of the
average level of services Ms. Andersen performed during the three-year period prior to her termination of employment with
WashingtonFirst and WashingtonFirst Bank. If Ms. Andersen’s service is terminated by Sandy Spring before the end of the consulting
term, she will be entitled to continued payment of the monthly consulting fees for the remainder of the consulting period. The
agreement also provides that Sandy Spring will indemnify Ms. Andersen for any excise tax that may result from the payments, benefits
or awards she receives under the agreement, together with any other payment, benefit or award which Ms. Andersen receives or has the
right to receive from Sandy Spring, Sandy Spring Bank, WashingtonFirst, WashingtonFirst Bank, or any corporation which is a
member of an affiliated group with the foregoing corporations that would constitute an “excess parachute payment” (as defined in
Section 280G of the Code). The agreement also provides that Sandy Spring will indemnify Ms. Andersen for any excise tax, income
tax, other tax imposed and attorneys’ fees that may result from any claim by the Internal Revenue Service of underpayment of the
excise tax.

The agreement provides that Ms. Andersen will continue to be subject to restrictive covenants contained in her existing
employment agreement with WashingtonFirst Bank, including non-competition and non-solicitation covenants and an indefinite
restriction on the disclosure of confidential information. The non-competition and non-solicitation covenants apply until 12 months
following the effective time of the first-step merger.

Agreements with Mr. Connors. It is anticipated that Mr. Connors will negotiate and enter into a bonus award and release
agreement with the terms as described as follows: The agreement will provide for Mr. Connors to waive his right to receive a lump sum
cash payment under his severance payment agreement in the event of a qualifying termination. In addition, the agreement will provide
for a transaction bonus and retention payments for Mr. Connors. Mr. Connors will be eligible to receive a transaction bonus payable at
the time of the first-step merger of $615,000 and retention payments of $100,000, payable in two equal installments at the time of the
first-step merger and six months thereafter. The payment of the retention amounts will be accelerated on a termination of employment
of Mr. Connors without cause or for “good reason” during the retention period provided that he complies with non-competition and
non-solicitation covenants applicable for the remainder of the retention period.

Table of Contents

Following the effective time of the first-step merger, Mr. Connors will serve as an Executive Vice President of Sandy Spring
under an employment agreement that has a term of two years. The employment agreement provides for an annual base salary of
$320,000 and the right to participate in Sandy Spring Bank’s incentive compensation and bonus plans. If, during the term of the
employment agreement, Mr. Connors’ employment with Sandy Spring Bank is terminated by Sandy Spring Bank without just cause or
by Mr. Connors with good reason, as each is defined in the employment agreement, Mr. Connors will be entitled to receive his salary
for the remaining term of the agreement.

Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance

Under the merger agreement, Sandy Spring has agreed to, following the effective time, indemnify and hold harmless all current
and former directors, officers and employees of WashingtonFirst and its subsidiaries against all costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time, whether asserted before or after the effective time, pertaining to (i) the
fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of WashingtonFirst, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors or was prior to the effective time serving at the request of any such party as a director, officer, employee, trustee or partner
of another corporation, partnership, trust, joint venture, employee benefit plan or other entity, or (ii) any matters arising in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, to the fullest extent such persons would have been indemnified or have
the right to advancement of expenses pursuant to WashingtonFirst’s articles of incorporation and bylaws (as in effect on the date of the
merger agreement) and as permitted by applicable law. Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst have also agreed to advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, provided that the person receiving such advance expenses provides a
signed written undertaking to repay such advances if the person is not entitled to mandatory indemnification and it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

The merger agreement requires the surviving corporation to maintain, for a period of six years after completion of the first-step
merger, WashingtonFirst’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy, or policies covering each person that was covered,
as of the date of the merger agreement, by WashingtonFirst’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with respect to
claims against such persons arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the effective time. However, the surviving
corporation is not required to spend annually more than 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date of the merger
agreement by WashingtonFirst for such insurance (which we refer to as the “premium cap”), and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed that amount, then the surviving corporation will maintain policies of insurance which provide as much
comparable coverage as is available at an annual premium equal to the premium cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Sandy Spring may
(i) request WashingtonFirst to obtain an extended reporting period endorsement under WashingtonFirst’s existing directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policy or (ii) substitute therefor “tail” policies the material terms of which (including coverage and
amount), are no less favorable in any material respect to such persons than WashingtonFirst’s existing insurance policies as of the date
of the merger agreement and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the
premium cap. For additional information see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Director and Officer Indemnification and
Insurance” beginning on page 106 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Appointment to the Board of Directors

The merger agreement provides that, at the effective time, Sandy Spring will: (i) increase the size of the Sandy Spring board and
the board of directors of Sandy Spring Bank to fifteen members, (ii) appoint Joseph

S. Bracewell, Shaza L. Andersen and two additional current members of the WashingtonFirst board, to be selected by Sandy Spring
after consultation with WashingtonFirst, to the Sandy Spring board and the board of directors of Sandy Spring Bank, with Joseph S.
Bracewell nominated as a Class I director (with a term expiring at the 2021 annual meeting of Sandy Spring’s stockholders) and the
other WashingtonFirst directors to be nominated to such classes as the nominating committee shall determine so that the number of
directors in each class is as nearly equal as possible and (iii) appoint Joseph S. Bracewell and Shaza L. Andersen to the executive
committee of the Sandy Spring board.

Public Trading Markets

Sandy Spring common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “SASR” and
WashingtonFirst common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “WFBI.” Upon the completion of the first-
step merger, WashingtonFirst common stock will no longer be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and will be de-registered under the
Exchange Act. It is a condition to each party’s obligations to complete the integrated mergers that the Sandy Spring common stock to
be issued pursuant to the merger agreement be authorized for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (subject to official notice of
issuance). Immediately following the completion of the Transactions, shares of Sandy Spring common stock will continue to be traded
on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “SASR.”

Dividend Policy

Sandy Spring currently pays a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share, which is expected to continue, although the Sandy
Spring board may change this dividend policy at any time. WashingtonFirst currently pays a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share,
which is expected to continue until the effective time, although, subject to certain restrictions in the merger agreement, the
WashingtonFirst board may change this dividend policy at any time. Sandy Spring will be entitled to receive dividends when and if
declared by the Sandy Spring Bank board out of funds legally available for dividends. The Sandy Spring board will consider Sandy
Spring’s financial condition and level of net income, future prospects, economic condition, industry practices and other factors,
including applicable banking laws and regulations, in determining whether to pay dividends in the future and the amount of such
dividends.

Sandy Spring’s principal source of income is dividends that are declared and paid by Sandy Spring Bank on its capital stock.
Therefore, Sandy Spring’s ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from Sandy Spring Bank. Insured
depository institutions such as Sandy Spring Bank are prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of
dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become “undercapitalized,” as such term is defined in the applicable
law and regulations. In the future, any declaration and payment of cash dividends will be subject to the Sandy Spring board’s
evaluation of Sandy Spring’s operating results, financial condition, future growth plans, general business and economic conditions, and
tax and other relevant considerations. The payment of cash dividends by Sandy Spring in the future will also be subject to certain other
legal and regulatory limitations and ongoing review by the Sandy Spring’s banking regulators.

Dissenters’ Rights

Dissenters’ rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary
transaction, such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value of their shares as determined by a court in a judicial
proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction. Virginia law
provides that a stockholder is not entitled to demand the fair value of his or her shares of stock in any transaction if the stock is listed
on a national securities exchange. Because WashingtonFirst’s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the holders of
WashingtonFirst common stock are not entitled to dissenters’ or appraisal rights with respect to the WashingtonFirst merger proposal.
However, because WashingtonFirst’s nonvoting common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, holders of
WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock are entitled to dissenters’ rights with respect to the WashingtonFirst merger proposal.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Transactions

Completion of the Transactions is subject to receipt of certain approvals, waivers and consents from applicable governmental and
regulatory authorities, without certain conditions being imposed by any governmental authority as part of a regulatory approval that
would reasonably be expected to result in a materially burdensome regulatory condition. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
merger agreement, Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts and cooperate to promptly
prepare and file all necessary documentation and to obtain as promptly as practicable all regulatory approvals necessary or advisable to
complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These include, among others, approval from the Federal Reserve
Board, the Maryland Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation and the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions. Sandy
Spring submitted applications to the Federal Reserve Board on June 29, 2017 and to the Maryland Office of the Commissioner of
Financial Regulation and the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions on July 5, 2017. As of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions has approved the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and the remainder of these applications remain outstanding. Although neither Sandy Spring nor WashingtonFirst knows of
any reason why any of these applications should not be approved in a timely manner, Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst cannot be
certain when, or if, the applications will be approved.

Federal Reserve Board

Sandy Spring is a bank holding company regulated and supervised under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
(which we refer to as the “Bank Holding Company Act”). Unless granted a waiver by the Federal Reserve Board, the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement require prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act.

Sandy Spring Bank is a Maryland state-chartered trust company with commercial banking powers that is regulated by the
Maryland Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation and the Federal Reserve Board. The merger of WashingtonFirst Bank
with and into Sandy Spring Bank requires prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Merger Act. In evaluating an
application for such approval, the Federal Reserve Board takes into consideration a number of factors, including (i) the competitive
impact of the transaction; (ii) financial and managerial resources of the bank parties to the bank merger or integrated mergers both on a
current and pro forma basis; (iii) the convenience and needs of the community to be served and the record of the banks under the
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (which we refer to as the “CRA”), including their CRA ratings; (iv) the banks’ effectiveness in
combating money laundering activities; and (v) the extent to which the bank merger or integrated mergers would result in greater or
more concentrated risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. In connection with its review, the Federal Reserve
Board provides an opportunity for public comment on the application and is authorized to hold a public meeting or other proceeding if
it determines that would be appropriate.

Maryland Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation

Because Sandy Spring Bank is chartered under the laws of the State of Maryland, the merger of WashingtonFirst Bank with and
into Sandy Spring Bank also requires prior approval of the Maryland Office of the Commission of Financial Regulation under
Maryland law. In evaluating an application for such approval, the Maryland Office of the Commissioner of Financial Regulation takes
into account, among other things, the capital structure of the surviving institution and whether the proposed transaction is against the
public interest.

Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions

Because WashingtonFirst Bank is chartered under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the first-step merger also requires
prior approval of the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions under Virginia law. In evaluating an application for such approval, the
Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions takes into account, among other things, (i) whether the proposed acquisition is detrimental to
the safety and soundness of either

institution; (ii) the qualifications, experience and financial responsibility of the acquiror’s directors and officers; (iii) whether the
proposed acquisition would be prejudicial to the interests of the depositors, creditors, beneficiaries of fiduciary accounts or
stockholders of either institution; and (iv) whether the proposed acquisition is in the public interest.

Litigation Related to the Transactions

On August 1, 2017, Paul Parshall, a purported stockholder of WashingtonFirst, filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, captioned Parshall v. WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc., et al. (17-cv-00877-
TSE-JFA), against WashingtonFirst, the members of the WashingtonFirst board and Sandy Spring on behalf of all WashingtonFirst
public stockholders. The lawsuit alleges that Sandy Spring’s registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part, omitted certain material information, which rendered the registration statement false and misleading.
The relief sought in the lawsuit includes preliminary and permanent injunction against the consummation of the Transactions,
rescission or rescissory damages if the Transactions are completed, costs and attorney’s fees. The defendants believe that the claims are
without merit and intend to defend against the suit vigorously. However, at this time, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the
lawsuit or the impact on Sandy Spring, WashingtonFirst or the Transactions.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following description of the merger agreement is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the express terms of
the merger agreement, which is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. We urge you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the legal document
governing the integrated mergers.

Structure of the Transactions

Each of the Sandy Spring board and the WashingtonFirst board has unanimously approved the merger agreement. The merger
agreement provides for (i) the merger of Merger Sub with and into WashingtonFirst, with WashingtonFirst continuing as the surviving
corporation in the first-step merger and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sandy Spring, (ii) immediately following the completion of
the first-step merger, WashingtonFirst will merge with and into Sandy Spring, with Sandy Spring continuing as the surviving
corporation in the second-step merger and (iii) immediately following the completion of the integrated mergers, WashingtonFirst Bank
will merge with and into Sandy Spring Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sandy Spring, with Sandy Spring Bank continuing as the
surviving bank in the bank merger.

Prior to the completion of the Transactions, Sandy Spring may change the method or structure of effecting the purposes of the
merger agreement (as reasonably determined by Sandy Spring) except that no such change may (i) alter or change the amount and kind
of the merger consideration, (ii) materially impede or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
or (iii) adversely affect the tax treatment of the integrated mergers with respect to their qualification as a reorganization under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. In the event that Sandy Spring elects to make such a change, Sandy Spring and
WashingtonFirst agree to execute appropriate documents to reflect the revised structure.

Merger Consideration

Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time of the first-step merger, each share of
WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock, except for the excluded shares, will be converted into
shares of Sandy Spring common stock as follows:
 

 •  if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is greater than $53.23, the exchange ratio will equal 0.8210;
 

 
•  if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is greater than $50.15 and equal to or less than $53.23, the exchange

ratio will equal the quotient of $43.70 divided by the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price;
 

 
•  if Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is equal to or greater than $37.07 and equal to or less than $50.15, the

exchange ratio will equal 0.8713;
 

 
•  if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is equal to or greater than $34.00 and less than $37.07, the exchange

ratio will equal the quotient of $32.30 divided by the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price; and
 

 •  if the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is less than $34.00, the exchange ratio will equal 0.9500.

Table of Contents

The following table illustrates the value of the merger consideration based on the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price.
Because the market value of Sandy Spring common stock will fluctuate, the value of the merger consideration may have a value as of
the date the WashingtonFirst stockholders receive their shares that is less than, or greater than, the value of merger consideration on the
date that the exchange ratio is determined.

If, between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time, the outstanding shares of Sandy Spring common stock is
increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or class of shares as a result of a stock dividend, subdivision,
recapitalization, reclassification, split, combination or exchange of shares, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment will be made to
the merger consideration. As of the effective time of the first-step merger, each share of WashingtonFirst common stock and
WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock held by WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring will be canceled for no consideration or payment.

Fractional Shares

Sandy Spring will not issue any fractional shares of Sandy Spring common stock in the first-step merger. Instead, any
WashingtonFirst stockholder who otherwise would have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Sandy Spring common stock
will instead be entitled to receive an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying the fraction of a share of
Sandy Spring common stock to which the holder would otherwise be entitled by the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price.

Governing Documents; Directors and Officers; Governance Matters

Upon the consummation of the integrated mergers, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Sandy Spring in effect immediately
prior to the effective time will be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving

corporation after completion of the integrated mergers, until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law and the terms of
such documents.

Upon consummation of the Transactions, Sandy Spring has agreed to (i) increase the size of the Sandy Spring board and the board
of directors of Sandy Spring Bank to fifteen members, (ii) appoint Joseph S. Bracewell, Shaza L. Andersen and two additional current
members of the WashingtonFirst board, to be selected by Sandy Spring after consultation with WashingtonFirst, to the Sandy Spring
board and the board of directors of Sandy Spring Bank, with Joseph S. Bracewell nominated as a Class I director (with a term expiring
at the 2021 annual meeting of Sandy Spring’s stockholders) and the other WashingtonFirst directors to be nominated to such classes as
the nominating committee shall determine so that the number of directors in each class is as nearly equal as possible and (iii) appoint
Joseph S. Bracewell and Shaza L. Andersen to the executive committee of the Sandy Spring board.

Treatment of WashingtonFirst Equity-Based Awards

Restricted Stock

At the effective time, each restricted stock award in respect of shares of WashingtonFirst common stock subject to vesting,
repurchase or other lapse restriction will become fully vested and the restrictions thereon will lapse, and each holder of such restricted
stock will be entitled to receive, without interest, the merger consideration.

Stock Options

Also at the effective time, all outstanding and unexercised options to purchase shares of WashingtonFirst common stock will be
canceled and will be cashed out for an amount equal to the value of the per share merger consideration less the option exercise price,
assuming for purposes of this calculation that all such options were 100% vested as of the effective time. The value of the per share
merger consideration for this purpose will be the exchange ratio multiplied by the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price.

Closing and Effective Time

The integrated mergers will be completed only if all conditions to the integrated mergers set forth in the merger agreement (as
discussed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus) are either satisfied or waived. See the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus entitled “— Conditions to Complete the Integrated Mergers.”

The first-step merger will become effective as of the date and time specified in the articles of merger to be filed with the Virginia
State Corporation Commission. The second-step merger will become effective immediately thereafter or as set forth in the articles of
merger to be filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission and the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation.
The closing of the integrated mergers will take place at a time agreed to by the parties to the merger agreement on the date designated
by Sandy Spring within seven days following satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions to closing set forth in
the merger agreement or such later date as the parties may otherwise agree. Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst currently expect to
complete the Transactions in the fourth quarter of 2017, subject to the requisite approval of the Sandy Spring stockholders, the requisite
approval of the WashingtonFirst stockholders, the receipt of regulatory approvals or waivers and the fulfillment of other customary
closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement, but neither Sandy Spring nor WashingtonFirst can guarantee when, or if, the
Transactions will be completed.

Conversion of Shares; Exchange of Certificates

The conversion of shares of WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock into the right to
receive the merger consideration will occur automatically at the effective time. Promptly

Table of Contents

following the completion of the first-step merger, the exchange agent will exchange certificates of WashingtonFirst common stock and
WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock for the merger consideration to be received pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement.

Letter of Transmittal

As promptly as reasonably practicable after the effective time, and in no event later than five business days thereafter, the
exchange agent will mail to each holder of record of WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock
immediately prior to the effective time a letter of transmittal and instructions on how to surrender their shares in exchange for the
merger consideration the holder is entitled to receive under the merger agreement and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Sandy
Spring common stock.

If a certificate for WashingtonFirst common stock or WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the exchange agent will issue the merger consideration upon receipt of (i) an affidavit of that fact by the claimant and (ii) if
required by Sandy Spring or the exchange agent, the posting of a bond in an amount as exchange agent may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate.

Immediately upon completion of the first-step merger, there will be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of
WashingtonFirst of shares of WashingtonFirst common stock or WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock, other than to settle
transfers of WashingtonFirst common stock or WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock that occurred prior to the effective time.
Sandy Spring and the exchange agent may rely upon WashingtonFirst’s stock transfer books to conclusively establish the identity of
WashingtonFirst stockholders entitled to receive the merger consideration.

Withholding

Sandy Spring and the exchange agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash amount payable under the merger
agreement to any holder of WashingtonFirst equity awards, the amounts they are required to deduct and withhold under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. If any such amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate governmental
authority, these amounts will be treated for all purposes of the merger agreement as having been paid to the stockholders from whom
they were withheld.

Dividends and Distributions

No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Sandy Spring common stock will be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered certificates of WashingtonFirst common stock or WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock until the holder surrenders
such certificate in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar laws, after the surrender of a certificate in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, the record holder of such
certificate will be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which subsequent to the
effective time had previously become payable but not paid with respect to shares of Sandy Spring common stock represented by such
person’s certificates representing shares of WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock.

Representations and Warranties

The representations, warranties and covenants described below, and elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and
included in the merger agreement were made by Sandy Spring and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and WashingtonFirst, on the other
hand, for the benefit of the other party, only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specific dates. In addition, the

standards relevant to investors. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants
may change after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in public

Certain representations and warranties of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst are qualified as to “materiality” or “material adverse
effect.” For purposes of the merger agreement, a “material adverse effect,” when used in reference to either Sandy Spring or
WashingtonFirst or the combined company, means a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations
of such party and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (provided that, any effect, change or circumstance resulting from the following shall
not be considered in determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred: (i) changes, after the date of the merger agreement, in
laws, rules, or regulations or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (which we refer to as “GAAP”) or applicable regulatory
accounting requirements or interpretations thereof by courts or governmental entities, that apply to financial and/or depository
institutions and/or their holding companies generally, (ii) changes, after the date of the merger agreement, in economic conditions
affecting financial institutions generally, including but not limited to, changes in the general level of market interest rates, (iii) actions
and omissions of Sandy Spring or WashingtonFirst taken with the prior written consent, or at the request, of the other, (iv) direct effects
of compliance with the merger agreement on the operating performance of the parties, including expenses related to the Transactions,
(v) changes in national or international political or social conditions including the engagement by the United States in hostilities,
whether or not pursuant to the declaration of a national emergency or war, or the occurrence of any military or terrorist attack upon or
within the United States and (vi) any failure, in and of itself (and not necessarily the facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing
to such failure), by Sandy Spring or WashingtonFirst to meet any internal or published projections, forecasts, estimates, or predictions
in respect of revenues, earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period; except, with respect to subclauses (i), (ii) and (v),
to the extent that the effects of such changes are disproportionately adverse to such party and its subsidiaries as compared to
comparable U.S. banking organizations.

organization, employees and advantageous business relationships, and take no action that would reasonably likely to adversely affect or
delay its ability to obtain any necessary approvals of any governmental entity or regulatory agency required for the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement or to perform its covenants and agreements under the merger agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby on a timely basis.

Additionally, prior to the effective time (or earlier termination of the merger agreement), subject to specified exceptions,

and employees, and maintain its rights and franchises in all material respects, and may not, and may not permit any of its subsidiaries

Regulatory Matters

Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare and file as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date of the merger agreement, all necessary applications, notices and filings, to obtain all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all governmental entities that are necessary or advisable, and all third parties that are
required, to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst have also agreed
to furnish each other with all information concerning the other party or its subsidiaries as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in
connection with any application, notice or filing to any governmental entity in connection with the Transactions, and Sandy Spring and
WashingtonFirst have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable have agreed to consult with the other on, all
information relating to Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst, as the case may be, and any of their respective subsidiaries, appearing in
any written materials submitted to any governmental entity. Each party has also agreed to provide the other with copies of any
applications and all related correspondence prior to filing, other than portions of such material filed under a claim of confidentiality and
to keep each other apprised of the status of matters related to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Employee Benefit Matters

Following the effective time, Sandy Spring has agreed to cause the surviving corporation to maintain, for the benefit of all
persons who were employees of WashingtonFirst and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time whose employment is not
specifically terminated at or prior to the effective time (whom we refer to as “continuing employees”), employee benefit plans and
compensation opportunities that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefit and compensation opportunities
that are generally made available to similarly situated employees of Sandy Spring or its subsidiaries, provided that no continuing
employee will be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan of Sandy Spring or its subsidiaries. Any employee of
WashingtonFirst or any of its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time whose employment is specifically terminated at or
prior to the effective time of the first-step merger and their qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued coverage under group
health plans of Sandy Spring in accordance with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.

Under the merger agreement, WashingtonFirst has agreed to, effective immediately prior to the effective time (or such later date
as requested by Sandy Spring or as may be required to comply with any applicable requirements contained in such plans), terminate
WashingtonFirst’s health and welfare plans and shall arrange for termination of all corresponding insurance policies, service
agreements and related arrangements effective on the same date, provided that no coverage of any of the continuing employees may
terminate under the WashingtonFirst plans prior to the time such continuing employees become eligible to participate in the health
plans, programs and benefits common to all employees of Sandy Spring and its subsidiaries.

Under the merger agreement, Sandy Spring has agreed to, effective as of the effective time, assume and honor in accordance with
their terms all employment, severance, change in control and other compensation agreements and arrangements between
WashingtonFirst or any of its subsidiaries and any of their employees, which are not terminated in connection with the consummation
of the Transactions, and all accrued and vested benefit obligations through the effective time which are between WashingtonFirst or
any of its subsidiaries and any of their current or former directors, officers, employees or consultants.

The merger agreement also provides that the surviving corporation, with respect to the continuing employees, agrees to undertake
the following:
 

 
•  provide each such continuing employee who becomes covered under health plans, programs and benefits of Sandy Spring or

any of its subsidiaries with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the effective time under a health plan
sponsored by WashingtonFirst for the plan year in which coverage commences under Sandy Spring’s health plan;

 

 
•  take and any all actions required to permit such continuing employees to roll over their account balances (excluding any

loans) in WashingtonFirst’s 401(k) plan immediately prior to the effective time into Sandy Spring’s 401(k) plan; and
 

 

•  recognize all service of such continuing employees with WashingtonFirst and its subsidiaries, for purposes of vesting and
determination of eligibility to participate under Sandy Spring’s compensation and benefit plans, programs or policies (other
than any plan that is frozen as to participation), except (i) to the extent duplication of benefits occurs with respect to the
same period of service, (ii) to the extent prohibited under Sandy Spring’s compensation and benefit plans, programs or
policies or (iii) for benefit accrual purposes under any of Sandy Spring’s compensation and benefit plans, programs or
policies (other than Sandy Spring’s paid time off program).

Effective as of the day immediately prior to and conditioned upon the occurrence of the closing, WashingtonFirst will take all
necessary and appropriate action to terminate its 401(k) plan. Upon termination of the 401(k) plan, all participants will be 100% vested
in their account balances. Upon written request by Sandy Spring, WashingtonFirst agrees to take all necessary steps to file or cause to
be filed all necessary documents with the Internal Revenue Service for a determination letter for termination of WashingtonFirst’s
401(k) plan.

Table of Contents

WashingtonFirst also agrees (i) to provide or direct the fiduciaries of the 401(k) plan to provide (to the extent permitted by law), Sandy
Spring and its counsel with a draft of each resolution, amendment, participant communication or other document relating to the
termination of WashingtonFirst’s 401(k) plan at least five business days before such document is adopted, distributed or filed, and
(ii) not to adopt, distribute or file any such document without Sandy’s Spring’s approval which may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

With respect to each full time WashingtonFirst employee (immediately prior to the effective time) who is involuntarily terminated
by Sandy Spring (other than for cause as determined by Sandy Spring) within twelve months of the effective time of the Transactions
upon signing an appropriate release in a form reasonably determined by Sandy Spring, Sandy Spring agrees to provide a severance
payment equal to two weeks’ base pay (at the rate in effect on the termination date) for each full year of service at WashingtonFirst,
with fractional years of service rounded up or down to the nearest full year, with a minimum payment equal to four weeks’ base pay for
WashingtonFirst employees who have one full year or less of service as of their date of termination and a maximum equal to twenty-six
weeks’ base pay, except that any such former employees of WashingtonFirst who are covered by a separate severance, change in
control or employment agreement or other arrangement providing for a payment triggered by the first-step merger or the bank merger
shall not receive any severance payment other than the one specified in such agreement.

Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance

Under the merger agreement, Sandy Spring has agreed to, following the effective time, indemnify and hold harmless all current
and former directors, officers and employees of WashingtonFirst and its subsidiaries against all costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred in
connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time, whether asserted before or after the effective
time, pertaining to (i) the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of WashingtonFirst, any of its subsidiaries or
any of their respective predecessors or was prior to the effective time serving at the request of any such party as a director, officer,
employee, trustee or partner of another corporation, partnership, trust, joint venture, employee benefit plan or other entity, or (ii) any
matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, to the fullest extent such persons would
have been indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses pursuant to WashingtonFirst’s articles of incorporation and bylaws
(as in effect on the date of the merger agreement) and as permitted by applicable law. Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst have also
agreed to advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, provided that the person receiving such
advance expenses provides a signed written undertaking to repay such advances if the person is not entitled to mandatory
indemnification and it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

The merger agreement requires the surviving corporation to maintain, for a period of six years after completion of the first-step
merger, WashingtonFirst’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy, or policies covering each person that was covered,
as of the date of the merger agreement, by WashingtonFirst’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy with respect to
claims against such persons arising from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the effective time. However, the surviving
corporation is not required to spend annually more than 300% of the current annual premium paid as of the date of the merger
agreement by WashingtonFirst for such insurance (which we refer to as the “premium cap”), and if such premiums for such insurance
would at any time exceed that amount, then the surviving corporation will maintain policies of insurance which provide as much
comparable coverage as is available at an annual premium equal to the premium cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Sandy Spring may
(i) request WashingtonFirst to obtain an extended reporting period endorsement under WashingtonFirst’s existing directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policy or (ii) substitute therefor “tail” policies the material terms of which (including coverage and
amount), are no less favorable in any material respect to such persons than WashingtonFirst’s existing insurance policies as of the

Table of Contents

date of the merger agreement and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the
premium cap.

Trust Preferred Securities and Subordinated Debt

At the effective time, Sandy Spring will expressly assume (including, without limitation, being substituted for WashingtonFirst)
and thereafter will perform all of WashingtonFirst’s obligations in connection with: (i) the indenture relating to such subordinated debt
securities and the trust preferred securities issued by Alliance Virginia Capital Trust I; and (ii) the indenture relating to
WashingtonFirst’s issuance of $25,000,000 principal amount of its 6.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2025. Sandy
Spring will also execute any and all documents, instruments and agreements, including any supplemental indentures, guarantees,
officers’ certificates, opinions of counsel and declarations of trust required by such indentures.

Certain Additional Covenants

The merger agreement also contains additional covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to the filing of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus and the registration statement that it is a part of, obtaining required consents, the listing of the shares of the
Sandy Spring common stock to be issued in the first-step merger, access to information of the other company and notification of certain
matters including certain threatened claims or litigation, defaults under material contracts or events or other occurrences reasonably
likely to result in a material adverse effect, exemption from anti-takeover laws and public announcements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Stockholder Meetings and Recommendations of the WashingtonFirst Board and Sandy Spring Board

Each of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst has agreed to hold a meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of voting upon
approval and adoption of the merger agreement, in the case of WashingtonFirst stockholders, and upon the Sandy Spring share
issuance, in the case of Sandy Spring stockholders, in each case, as soon as reasonably practicable after the registration statement (of
which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part) is declared effective. WashingtonFirst has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain from its stockholders the vote required to approve the merger agreement, including by communicating to its stockholders its
recommendation (and including such recommendation in this joint proxy statement/prospectus) that they approve the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and Sandy Spring has made similar covenants with respect to the Sandy Spring
share issuance.

If the Sandy Spring board, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law
to continue to recommend approval of the issuance of shares of Sandy Spring common stock in connection with the first-step merger,
then it may (but will not be required to) submit the merger agreement to its stockholders without recommendation (although the
resolutions approving the merger agreement as of the date thereof may not be rescinded or amended) and may communicate the basis
for its lack of a recommendation to its stockholders to the extent required by law.

If the WashingtonFirst board, after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisors, determines in good faith that it would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law
to continue to recommend the merger agreement, then it may fail to make such recommendation or withdraw, modify or change any
such recommendation (although the resolutions approving the merger agreement as of the date therefor may not be rescinded or
amended); except that the WashingtonFirst board may not take any such actions unless (i) WashingtonFirst gives Sandy Spring at least
three business days’ prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances
giving rise to its determination to take such action (including, if such action is taken in response to any third-party proposal or offer or
indication of interest with respect to any of the following: (1) any

merger, consolidation, share exchange, combination, or other similar transaction involving WashingtonFirst or any of its subsidiaries;
(2) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of, or any tender or exchange offer resulting in such third party beneficially owning,
25% or more of any class of equity securities or the consolidated assets of WashingtonFirst whether through a series of transactions or
otherwise (each of which we refer to as an “acquisition proposal”), its basis for determining that such acquisition proposal constitutes a
superior proposal (as defined in the section entitled “— Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers” below) to the contemplated
Transactions (including the latest material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the third-party making, any such acquisition
proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances)) and (ii) at the
end of such notice period, the WashingtonFirst board takes into account any amendment or modification to the merger agreement
proposed by Sandy Spring (it being understood that Sandy Spring will not have any obligation to propose any adjustments,
modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement), and after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, again determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be
reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend the merger agreement.
Any material amendment to any acquisition proposal will require a new determination and notice period.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, each of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst has agreed to adjourn or postpone the Sandy
Spring stockholder meeting or the WashingtonFirst stockholder meeting, as the case may be, if, as of the time for which such meeting
is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Sandy Spring common stock or WashingtonFirst common stock, as the case may
be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the
date of such meeting, WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring, as applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares necessary to obtain the requisite WashingtonFirst stockholder approval or the requisite Sandy Spring stockholder approval.

Agreement Not to Solicit Other Offers

From the date of the merger agreement until the closing of the Transactions (or earlier termination of the merger agreement),
WashingtonFirst has agreed that it will not, and will not authorize or permit any of its subsidiaries or any of its or its subsidiaries’
officers, directors, or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative (which we
refer to as its “representatives”) to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or take any other action to facilitate, any
inquiries, discussions or proposals that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal, (ii) provide any
information or data regarding WashingtonFirst or any of its subsidiaries to any person in connection with or in response to an
acquisition proposal or an inquiry or indication of interest that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal, or
(iii) continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations, or otherwise communicate in any way with any person (other
than Sandy Spring, Merger Sub or a representative of either) regarding an acquisition proposal. However, if WashingtonFirst receives
an unsolicited bona fide written acquisition proposal prior to the date of the WashingtonFirst stockholder meeting and such acquisition
proposal did not result from a breach of WashingtonFirst’s non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement, WashingtonFirst
may, and may permit its subsidiaries and its and its subsidiaries’ representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic
information or data and participate in negotiations or discussions to the extent that the WashingtonFirst board concludes in good faith
(after receiving the advice of its outside counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that (1) such acquisition
proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal and (2) failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely
to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, except that, prior to providing any such nonpublic information or
data, WashingtonFirst must have provided such information or data to Sandy Spring and have entered into a confidentiality agreement
with such third party on terms no more favorable to such third party than the confidentiality provisions in a letter agreement, dated
February 9, 2017, between Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst, which confidentiality agreement does not provide such third party with
any exclusive right to negotiate with WashingtonFirst.

Table of Contents

WashingtonFirst has also agreed to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations
existing as of the date of the merger agreement with any parties other than Sandy Spring, with respect to any acquisition proposal. In
addition, WashingtonFirst has agreed that it will not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or
standstill agreements to which WashingtonFirst or any of its subsidiaries is party and to use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which WashingtonFirst or any of its subsidiaries is party in accordance with the terms thereof.

WashingtonFirst has also agreed to promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) advise Sandy Spring of receipt of any acquisition
proposal or any inquiry with respect to or which could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal, and the substance
thereof (including, in each case, the identity of the person making such inquiry or acquisition proposal and the material terms and
conditions thereof), to provide to Sandy Spring copies of any written materials received by WashingtonFirst or any of its subsidiaries in
connection therewith and to keep Sandy Spring apprised of any related developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis,
including any amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or acquisition proposal. Unless the merger agreement has been
terminated in accordance with its terms, WashingtonFirst is prohibited from entering into, and must cause its subsidiaries and cause its
and their officers, directors, agents, advisors and representatives not to enter into on its behalf, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement relating to any acquisition
proposal.

For purposes of the merger agreement, a “superior proposal” means any bona fide written offer or proposal made by a third party
to consummate an acquisition proposal that the WashingtonFirst board determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its
outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors): (1) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition of all,
but not less than all, of the issued and outstanding shares of WashingtonFirst common stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of
WashingtonFirst; (2) would result in a transaction that (A) involves consideration to the holders of the shares of WashingtonFirst
common stock that is more favorable, from a financial point of view, than the consideration to be paid to the stockholders of
WashingtonFirst pursuant to the merger agreement, considering, among other things, the nature of the consideration being offered and
any material regulatory approvals or other risks associated with the timing of the proposed transaction beyond, or in addition to, those
specifically contemplated by the merger agreement, and which proposal is not conditioned upon obtaining financing and (B) is, in light
of the other terms of such proposal, more favorable to the stockholders of WashingtonFirst than the integrated mergers and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and (3) is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed, in each case,
taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the acquisition proposal.

Conditions to Completing the Integrated Mergers

Sandy Spring’s and WashingtonFirst’s respective obligations to complete the integrated mergers are subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the following customary closing conditions:
 

 
•  the approval of the merger agreement by the WashingtonFirst stockholders and the approval of the Sandy Spring share

issuance by the Sandy Spring stockholders;
 

 
•  the authorization for listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, subject to official notice of issuance, of the Sandy Spring

common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger agreement;
 

 

•  the receipt of requisite regulatory approvals, consents or waivers, including from the Federal Reserve Board, the Maryland
Office of the Commission of Financial Regulation, the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions, state securities or “blue
sky” authorities, and the expiration or termination of all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof, without the imposition
of any materially burdensome regulatory condition or requirement;

 

 

•  the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, with respect to the
Sandy Spring common stock to be issued upon the consummation of the first-step merger, and the absence of any stop order
(or proceedings for that purpose initiated or threatened and not withdrawn) suspending the effectiveness of such registration
statement;

Table of Contents

 

•  the absence of any order, injunction, or decree of any court or agency of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or
prohibition preventing the completion of the consummation of the integrated mergers or any of the other Transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, and the absence of any statute, rule, regulation, order, injunction or decree enacted,
entered, promulgated or enforced by any governmental entity which prohibits or makes illegal consummation of the
integrated mergers;

 

 

•  the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party contained in the merger agreement as of the date on
which the merger agreement was entered into and (except to the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an
earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be so true and correct as of such earlier date) as of the
date on which the first-step merger is completed, subject to the materiality standards provided in the merger agreement (and
the receipt by each party of an officers’ certificate from the other party to such effect);

 

 
•  the performance in all material respects by the other party of all obligations required to be performed by it under the merger

agreement at or prior to the date on which the integrated mergers are completed (and the receipt by each party of an officers’
certificate from the other party to such effect);

 

 
•  receipt by such party of an opinion of legal counsel to the effect that on the basis of facts, representations and assumptions

set forth or referred to in such opinion (which must be consistent with the state of facts existing as of the effective time), the
integrated mergers will together be treated as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code; and

 

 
•  with respect only to Sandy Spring’s obligation to complete the integrated mergers, the absence of the occurrence of any

material adverse effect with respect to WashingtonFirst since the date of the merger agreement.

Neither WashingtonFirst nor Sandy Spring can be certain when, or if, the conditions to the integrated mergers will be satisfied or
waived or that the integrated mergers will be completed.

Termination of the Merger Agreement

The merger agreement can be terminated, and the integrated mergers abandoned, at any time prior to completion of the first-step
merger, by action taken or authorized by the board of directors of the terminating party, either before or after obtaining the requisite
stockholder approval (whether with respect to the approval of the merger agreement or the issuance of shares of Sandy Spring common
stock in connection therewith, as the case may be) in the following circumstances:
 

 •  by mutual written consent of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst;
 

 

•  by either Sandy Spring or WashingtonFirst, if (i) WashingtonFirst failed to obtain the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of WashingtonFirst common stock at its duly convened stockholder meeting or at any
adjournment thereof at which a vote on the adoption of the merger agreement was taken or (ii) if Sandy Spring failed to
obtain the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the shares of Sandy Spring common stock at the
Sandy Spring stockholder meeting to approve the Sandy Spring share issuance at its duly convened stockholder meeting or
at any adjournment thereof at which a vote on the Sandy Spring share issuance was taken;

 

 

•  by either Sandy Spring or WashingtonFirst, if (i) any governmental entity denies any regulatory approval, consent or waiver
required to consummate the Transactions and such denial has become final and non-appealable or (ii) any governmental
entity of competent jurisdiction has issued a final and non-appealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement;

 

 
•  by either Sandy Spring or WashingtonFirst, in the event that the first-step merger has not been consummated on or before the

termination date, which is the one year anniversary of the date of the merger agreement, unless the failure to so consummate
by such date is due to the failure of the terminating party to perform or observe its obligations under the merger agreement;

•  by either Sandy Spring or WashingtonFirst (except that the terminating party cannot then be in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the merger agreement) if the other party breaches any of
its covenants or agreements set forth in the merger agreement or any of its representations and warranties set forth in the
merger agreement ceases to be true, such that in either case, such breach or untrue representation or warranty would
constitute, if occurring or continuing on the closing date, the failure of a closing condition of the terminating party and such
breach is not cured within 30 days following written notice to the breaching party, or such breach cannot be cured during

(i) fails to recommend in this joint proxy statement/prospectus that the Sandy Spring stockholders approve the Sandy Spring
share issuance in connection with the first-step merger, or takes or resolves to take certain adverse actions with respect to
such recommendation or fails to reaffirm such recommendation within two business days after WashingtonFirst’s requests in
writing that such action be taken or (ii) breaches certain obligations, including with respect to calling a meeting of its
stockholders and recommending that they approve the Sandy Spring share issuance, in any material respect; or

 

 

•  by Sandy Spring, prior to the time that the WashingtonFirst stockholders approve the merger agreement, if the
WashingtonFirst board (i) fails to recommend in this joint proxy statement/prospectus that the WashingtonFirst stockholders
approve the merger agreement, or takes or resolves to take certain adverse actions with respect to such recommendation,
(ii) fails to recommend against acceptance of a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding WashingtonFirst common
stock that has been publicly disclosed (other than by Sandy Spring or an affiliate of Sandy Spring) within 10 business days
after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, (iii) recommends or endorses an acquisition proposal or
(iv) breaches certain obligations, including with respect to the solicitation of acquisition proposals or calling a meeting of its
stockholders and recommending that they approve the merger agreement, in any material respect.

Additionally, WashingtonFirst may terminate the merger agreement if, as of the effective date, the Sandy Spring volume-weighted
average price is less than $34.00. If WashingtonFirst elects to exercise its termination right under such circumstances, it must notify
Sandy Spring in writing of such election no later than the last day of the three-day period beginning on the fifth business day
immediately preceding the closing date. During the three day period commencing with Sandy Spring’s receipt of any such notice duly
delivered by or on behalf of WashingtonFirst electing to exercise its right to terminate the merger agreement as described above, Sandy
Spring will have the option to either (a) increase the exchange ratio to equal $32.30 divided by the Sandy Spring volume-weighted
average price or (b) pay, as part of the merger consideration, an additional amount in cash, without interest, equal to (x) $32.30 minus
(y) the Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price multiplied by 0.9500.

If within such three-day period, Sandy Spring delivers written notice to WashingtonFirst that it intends to proceed with the
integrated mergers by paying such additional consideration, and notifies WashingtonFirst of the revised exchange ratio or additional
cash payment, then no termination by WashingtonFirst will have occurred, and the merger agreement will remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms (except as the exchange ratio shall have been so modified, and any references in the merger
agreement to the merger consideration shall thereafter include any additional cash payment described above).

Effect of Termination

If the merger agreement is terminated, it will become void and have no effect, and there will be no liability on the part of any
party thereto or their respective officers and directors, except that (i) each of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst will remain liable for
any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or willful breach of any provision of the merger agreement and (ii) designated
provisions of the merger agreement will survive the

Termination Fee

In the event that the merger agreement is terminated by Sandy Spring prior to the approval by WashingtonFirst stockholders of
the merger agreement based on the WashingtonFirst board having (i) failed to recommend in this joint proxy statement/prospectus that
the WashingtonFirst stockholders approve the merger agreement, or withdrawn, modified or qualified such recommendation in a
manner adverse to Sandy Spring, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm such recommendation within two business days after Sandy
Spring has requested in writing that such action be taken, or failed to recommend against acceptance of a tender offer or exchange offer
for outstanding WashingtonFirst common stock that has been publicly disclosed (other than by Sandy Spring or an affiliate of Sandy
Spring) within 10 business days after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, or (ii) recommended or endorsed an
acquisition proposal or (iii) breached certain obligations, including with respect to the non-solicitation of acquisition proposals or
calling a meeting of its stockholders and recommending that the WashingtonFirst stockholders approve the merger agreement, in any
material respect, then in either case (i), (ii) or (iii), WashingtonFirst will pay Sandy Spring, by wire transfer of same day funds, a $18.5
million termination fee.

Sandy Spring will pay WashingtonFirst, by wire transfer of same day funds a $18.5 million termination fee, in the event that the
merger agreement is terminated by WashingtonFirst prior to the stockholder approval of the Sandy Spring share issuance (in
connection with the first-step merger) based on the Sandy Spring board having (i) failed to recommend in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus that the Sandy Spring stockholders approve the Sandy Spring share issuance, or withdrawn, modified or qualified
such recommendation in a manner adverse to WashingtonFirst, or resolved to do so, or failed to reaffirm such recommendation within
two business days after WashingtonFirst requests in writing that such action be taken or (ii) breached certain obligations, including
with respect to calling a meeting of its stockholders and recommending that they approve the Sandy Spring share issuance, in any
material respect.

In the event that, after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the termination of the merger agreement, (i) a bona fide
acquisition proposal (which would, to the extent applicable, result in a third party beneficially owning 50% or more of any class of
equity securities or the consolidated assets of WashingtonFirst whether through a series of transactions or otherwise) has been made
known to senior management or the WashingtonFirst board or has been made directly to its stockholders generally or any person has
publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an acquisition proposal (which would, to the extent applicable, result in a third party
beneficially owning 50% or more of any class of equity securities or the consolidated assets of WashingtonFirst whether through a
series of transactions or otherwise) with respect to WashingtonFirst, and (ii) thereafter, either (A) the merger agreement is terminated
by either Sandy Spring or WashingtonFirst because the integrated mergers have not been completed prior to the termination date or
because the requisite WashingtonFirst stockholder vote approving the merger agreement has not been obtained or (B) the merger
agreement is terminated by Sandy Spring based on a breach of the merger agreement by WashingtonFirst that would constitute the
failure of a closing condition and that has not been cured during the permitted time period or by its nature cannot be cured during such
period and (iii) within 12 months after the date of such termination, WashingtonFirst enters into a definitive agreement or consummates
a transaction with respect to an acquisition proposal (which would, to the extent applicable, result in a third party beneficially owning
50% or more of any class of equity securities or the consolidated assets of WashingtonFirst whether through a series of transactions or
otherwise) whether or not the same acquisition proposal as that referred to above, then WashingtonFirst will, on the earlier of the date it
enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Sandy Spring, by wire transfer of same
day funds, a $18.5 million termination fee.

Expenses and Fees

All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby will be paid
by the party incurring such expense, except that the costs and expenses of printing and mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus

the merger agreement except that, after approval of the merger agreement by the WashingtonFirst stockholders or the approval of the
issuance of shares of Sandy Spring common stock in connection with the first-step merger by the Sandy Spring stockholders, there may
not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment or modification of the merger agreement that would reduce the
amount or alter or change the kind of consideration to be received by holders of WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst
non-voting common stock or that would contravene any provision of applicable law.

At any time prior to the completion of the first-step merger, the parties may, to the extent legally permitted, extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained in the merger agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to the merger agreement, and waive compliance with any of
the agreements or satisfaction of any conditions contained in the merger agreement, except that after approval of the merger agreement

first-step merger by the Sandy Spring stockholders, there may not be, without further approval of such stockholders, any extension or
waiver of the merger agreement or any portion thereof that requires further approval under applicable law.

WashingtonFirst Voting Agreements

Simultaneously with the execution of the merger agreement, Sandy Spring entered into separate voting agreements with each of
the directors of WashingtonFirst, solely in his or her capacity as a stockholder, of WashingtonFirst, pursuant to which each such
stockholder agreed among other things, to vote all shares of WashingtonFirst common stock over which he or she exercises sole

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

The integrated mergers will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, in accordance with the provisions of
FASB ASC Topic 805-10, Business Combinations. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets (including identifiable
intangible assets) and liabilities (including executory contracts and other commitments) of WashingtonFirst as of the effective date of
the integrated mergers will be recorded at their respective fair values and added to those of Sandy Spring. If the purchase price exceeds
the difference between the fair value of assets acquired and the fair value of the liabilities assumed, then such excess will be recorded
as goodwill. Financial statements of Sandy Spring issued after the completion of the integrated mergers will reflect these fair values
and will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of WashingtonFirst before the
integrated mergers.

U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE INTEGRATED MERGERS

The following is a discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the integrated mergers to “U.S. holders” (as defined
below) of WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock and is based upon the Code, Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings and judicial decisions in effect as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, all of which are subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could affect the
accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising
under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 nor does
it address any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction or under any U.S. federal laws other
than those pertaining to the income tax. No assurance can be given that the Internal Revenue Service would not assert, or that a court
would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences set forth below.

For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of WashingtonFirst common stock or WashingtonFirst non-
voting common stock that for U.S. federal income tax purposes is: (i) a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, or an
entity treated as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state or political subdivision
thereof; (iii) a trust (a) if the administration thereof is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or
more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of such trust or (b) that has a valid election in effect
under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person; or (iv) an estate that is subject to U.S. federal income tax
on its income regardless of the source.

If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds
WashingtonFirst common stock, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding WashingtonFirst common stock, you should consult your tax advisor.

The following summary addresses only those U.S. holders that hold their WashingtonFirst common stock or WashingtonFirst
non-voting common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. It does not address all the tax
consequences that may be relevant to particular stockholders in light of their individual circumstances or to stockholders that are
subject to special rules, including, without limitation: financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; S corporations, partnerships or
other pass-through entities (or an investor in an S corporation, partnership or other pass-through entity); insurance companies; mutual
funds; dealers in stocks or securities, or foreign currencies; non-U.S. holders; a trader in securities who elects the mark-to-market
method of accounting for the securities; persons that hold shares as a hedge against currency risk, a straddle or a constructive sale or
conversion transaction; holders who acquired their shares pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as
compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan; and holders of WashingtonFirst stock options, stock warrants or debt
instruments. In addition, the discussion does not address any alternative minimum tax or any state, local or foreign tax consequences of
the merger, nor does it address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the
Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.

The Integrated Mergers

In the opinion of Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP and Troutman Sanders LLP, the integrated mergers will together be
treated as an integrated transaction that qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, with the tax
consequences described below. The opinions will be given in reliance on facts and representations contained in representation letters
from each of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel, and on
customary factual assumptions. Neither of these opinions of counsel is binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts and no
ruling has been, or will be, sought from the Internal Revenue Service as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the

integrated mergers. Accordingly, each WashingtonFirst stockholder should consult its own tax advisor with respect to the particular tax
consequences of the merger to such holder.

It is a condition to the obligation of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst to complete the integrated mergers that they receive a
written opinion from their counsel, dated the closing date of the integrated mergers, to the effect that the integrated mergers will
together be treated as an integrated transaction that qualifies as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

Consequences to Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst

Each of Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst will be a party to the integrated mergers within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the
Code, and neither Sandy Spring nor WashingtonFirst will recognize any gain or loss as a result of the integrated mergers.

Consequences to Stockholders

U.S. holders of WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock that exchange all of their shares
solely for Sandy Spring common stock will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except, as
discussed below, with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Sandy Spring common stock.

U.S. holders of WashingtonFirst common stock and WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock that receive cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Sandy Spring common stock in the first-step merger generally will be treated as if the fractional shares of Sandy
Spring common stock had been distributed to them as part of the first-step merger, and then redeemed by Sandy Spring in exchange for
the cash actually distributed in lieu of the fractional shares, with the redemption generally qualifying as an “exchange” under
Section 302 of the Code. Consequently, those holders generally will recognize capital gain or loss with respect to the cash payments
they receive in lieu of fractional shares measured by the difference between the amount of cash received and the tax basis allocated to
the fractional shares, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, as of the effective date of the first-step merger, the holding period of
such shares is greater than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Each U.S. holder’s aggregate tax basis in Sandy Spring common stock received in the merger will be equal to the U.S. holder’s
aggregate adjusted tax basis in the WashingtonFirst common stock exchanged in the first-step merger, decreased by the amount of any
tax basis allocable to any fractional share interest for which cash is received (described above). The holding period of Sandy Spring
common stock received by a U.S. holder in the first-step merger will include the holding period of the WashingtonFirst common stock
or WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock exchanged in the first-step merger if the WashingtonFirst common stock or
WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock exchanged is held as a capital asset at the time of the first-step merger. If a U.S. holder
acquired different blocks of the WashingtonFirst common stock or WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock at different times or at
different prices, the Sandy Spring common stock such holder receives will be allocated pro rata to each block of the WashingtonFirst
common stock or WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock, and the basis and holding period of each block of Sandy Spring common
stock such holder receives will be determined on a block-for-block basis depending on the basis and holding period of the blocks of the
WashingtonFirst common stock or WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock exchanged for such block of Sandy Spring common
stock.

Backup Withholding and Reporting Requirements

U.S. holders of WashingtonFirst common stock or WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock, other than certain exempt
recipients, may be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 28% with respect to any cash payment received in the first-step merger in
lieu of fractional shares. However, backup withholding will not

Table of Contents

apply to any U.S. holder that either (a) furnishes to Sandy Spring a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that it is not
subject to backup withholding and Sandy Spring and its exchange agent have not received notice to the contrary or (b) otherwise
proves to Sandy Spring and its exchange agent that the U.S. holder is exempt from backup withholding.

In addition, U.S. holders of WashingtonFirst common stock or WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock are required to retain
permanent records and make such records available to any authorized Internal Revenue Service officers and employees. The records
should include the number of shares of WashingtonFirst stock exchanged, the number of shares of Sandy Spring stock received, the fair
market value and tax basis of WashingtonFirst shares exchanged and the U.S. holder’s tax basis in the Sandy Spring common stock
received.

If a U.S. holder of WashingtonFirst common stock or WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock that exchanges such stock for
Sandy Spring common stock is a “significant holder” with respect to WashingtonFirst, the U.S. holder is required to include a
statement with respect to the exchange on or with the federal income tax return of the U.S. holder for the year of the exchange. A U.S.
holder of WashingtonFirst common stock or WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock will be treated as a significant holder in
WashingtonFirst if the U.S. holder’s ownership interest in WashingtonFirst is 5% or more of WashingtonFirst’s issued and outstanding
common stock or if the U.S. holder’s basis in the shares of WashingtonFirst stock exchanged is $1,000,000 or more. The statement
must be prepared in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-3 and must include the names and employer identification
numbers of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring, the date of the first-step merger, and the fair market value and tax basis of
WashingtonFirst shares exchanged (determined immediately before the first-step merger).

This discussion of U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is not intended to be,
and should not be construed as, tax advice. Determining the actual tax consequences of the integrated mergers to you may be
complex and will depend on your specific situation and on factors that are not within our control. You should consult your tax
advisors with respect to the application of U.S. federal income tax laws to your particular situations as well as any tax
consequences arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules or under the laws of any state, local, foreign or other taxing
jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.

Law, federal law, Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation and Sandy Spring’s bylaws. Copies of Sandy Spring’s articles of
incorporation and bylaws have been filed with the SEC and are also available upon request from Sandy Spring. To find out where
copies of these documents can be obtained, see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Where You Can Find More
Information” beginning on page 150.

on other matters as are required to be presented to them under Maryland law or as are otherwise presented to them by the Sandy Spring
board. Generally, each holder of Sandy Spring common stock is entitled to one vote per share and will not have any right to cumulate
votes in the election of directors. If Sandy Spring issues shares of Sandy Spring preferred stock, holders of the Sandy Spring preferred
stock may also possess voting rights, including the right, voting separately as a class, to elect one or more directors (in addition to the
directors elected by the holders of Sandy Spring common stock).

Liquidation Rights

In the event of Sandy Spring’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of Sandy Spring common stock would be entitled to
receive, after payment or provision for payment of all its debts and liabilities, all of the assets of Sandy Spring available for
distribution. If preferred stock is issued, the holders thereof may have a priority over the holders of the common stock in the event of
liquidation, dissolution or winding up.

Dividend Rights

Holders of Sandy Spring common stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends as may be declared by the Sandy Spring
board out of legally available funds. The ability of the Sandy Spring board to declare and pay dividends on Sandy Spring common
stock is subject to the terms of applicable Maryland law and banking regulations. If Sandy Spring issues shares of preferred stock, the
holders thereof may have a priority over the holders of the common stock with respect to dividends.

Preferred Stock

Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation authorize the Sandy Spring board, without further stockholder action, to classify and
reclassify any unissued shares of capital stock into a class or classes of preferred stock and to provide for the issuance of the shares of
preferred stock in series, and by filing articles supplementary to the articles of incorporation pursuant to the applicable law of the State
of Maryland, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the designation, powers,
preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. As of the Sandy
Spring record date, there were no shares of Sandy Spring preferred stock outstanding. Preferred stock may be issued with preferences
and designations as the Sandy Spring board may from time to time determine. The Sandy Spring board may, without stockholder
approval, issue shares of preferred stock with voting, dividend, liquidation and conversion rights that could dilute the voting strength of
the holders of Sandy Spring common stock.

do not reflect the realization of potential cost savings, revenue synergies or any potential restructuring costs. Certain cost savings and
revenue synergies may result from the Transactions. However, there can be no assurance that these cost savings or revenue synergies
will be achieved. Cost savings, if achieved, could result from, among other things, the reduction of operating expenses, changes in
corporate infrastructure and governance, the elimination of duplicative operating systems and the combination of regulatory and
financial reporting requirements under one Maryland state-chartered trust company with commercial banking powers. The pro forma
information is not necessarily indicative of what the financial position or results of operations actually would have been had the
Transactions been completed at the dates indicated. In addition, the unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not
purport to project the future financial position or operating results of the combined company after completion of the Transactions.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements

Note A — Basis of Presentation

On May 15, 2017, Sandy Spring entered into the merger agreement with WashingtonFirst. The merger agreement provides for
(i) the merger of Merger Sub with and into WashingtonFirst, with WashingtonFirst continuing as the surviving corporation in the first-
step merger and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sandy Spring, (ii) immediately following the completion of the first-step merger,
WashingtonFirst will merge with and into Sandy Spring, with Sandy Spring continuing as the surviving corporation in the second-step
merger and (iii) immediately following the completion of the integrated mergers, WashingtonFirst Bank will merge with and into
Sandy Spring Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sandy Spring, with Sandy Spring Bank continuing as the surviving bank in the bank
merger.

The merger agreement provides that at the effective time of the first-step merger, each outstanding share of common stock of
WashingtonFirst will be converted into the right to receive 0.8713 shares of Sandy Spring common stock, subject to adjustment if the
Sandy Spring volume-weighted average price is more than $50.15 or less than $37.07 per share. Pursuant to the merger agreement, at
the effective time of the first-step merger, shares of WashingtonFirst restricted stock that were unvested prior to the first-step merger
will vest and convert into the right to receive the merger consideration. Also under the terms of the merger agreement, all outstanding
and unexercised options to purchase shares of WashingtonFirst common stock will be canceled and will be cashed out for an amount
equal to the value of the per share merger consideration less the option exercise price, assuming for purposes of this calculation that all
such options were 100% vested as of the effective time.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of Sandy Spring’s financial condition and results of
operations, including per share data, are presented after giving effect to the integrated mergers. The pro forma financial information
assumes that the integrated mergers were consummated on January 1, 2016 for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statements of income and on June 30, 2017 for purposes of the pro forma statement of condition and gives effect to the
integrated mergers, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income, as if they had been effective
during the entire periods presented. The pro forma financials also give effect to the issuance by Sandy Spring of 11,298,000 shares of
common stock on the acquisition date (expected during the fourth quarter of 2017), as if the issuance had occurred on January 1, 2016.

The Transactions will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting; accordingly, the difference between the
purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities assumed will
be recorded as goodwill.

The pro forma financial information includes estimated adjustments to record the assets and liabilities of WashingtonFirst at their
respective fair values and represents management’s estimates based on currently available information. The pro forma adjustments
included herein may be revised as additional information becomes available and as additional analysis is performed. The final
allocation of the purchase price will be determined after the Transactions are completed and after completion of a final analysis to
determine the fair values of WashingtonFirst’s tangible, and identifiable intangible, assets and liabilities as of the closing date.

Note B — Pro Forma Financial Adjustments

The following pro forma adjustments have been reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.
All adjustments are based on the current valuations, estimates and assumptions that are subject to change.
 

 
(a) In anticipation of the Transactions, Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst are expected to incur an estimated $25.8 million of

merger expenses. Additionally, Sandy Spring is expected to settle WashingtonFirst’s stock options in the total amount of
$15.6 million as a part of the total consideration transferred.

(b) A fair value adjustment was recorded to WashingtonFirst’s outstanding loan portfolio. This fair value adjustment was based
on (1) current market interest rates and (2) Sandy Spring’s initial evaluation of credit quality of WashingtonFirst’s loan
portfolio. Total estimated fair value adjustment related to credit deterioration of the acquired portfolio amounted to
approximately $25.3 million, which represented a mark of approximately 2% on WashingtonFirst’s outstanding loan
portfolio. Of the $25.3 million credit mark, approximately $3.5 million is estimated to be an accretable adjustment and $5.1
million is estimated to be a non-accretable adjustment. Upward fair value adjustment related to difference in interest rates of
$22.9 million was also recorded.

 

 
(c) Adjustment reflects elimination of unamortized net deferred loan originations costs and previous fair value adjustment from

the acquired WashingtonFirst loan portfolio.
 

 (d) Adjustment reflects elimination of the allowance for loan losses of WashingtonFirst.
 

 (e) Adjustment reflects write-off of obsolete premises and equipment.
 

 

(f) Adjustment reflects elimination of WashingtonFirst’s goodwill in the amount of $11.4 million. Goodwill of $291.4 million
generated as a result of the total consideration transferred and the fair value of assets purchased exceeding the fair value of
liabilities assumed is recorded. The following table presents the sensitivity of the purchase price and resulting goodwill to
changes in the price of Sandy Spring’s common stock.

(g) Previous other intangibles of WashingtonFirst in the amount of $1.5 million are eliminated. New amount of $9.5 million
represents WashingtonFirst’s estimated fair value of (1) core deposit intangibles of $7.5 million and (2) wealth management
book of business of $2.0 million. The fair value estimate of core deposit intangibles represents a 1.25% premium on
WashingtonFirst’s core deposits. The actual amount of such core deposit intangibles assets will be determined upon
completion of the Transactions and the estimated pro forma adjustment could change significantly.

 

 
(h) Deferred taxes associated with the adjustments to record assets and liabilities of WashingtonFirst at fair value. Deferred tax

was recognized using WashingtonFirst’s statutory tax rate of 35%.
 

 
(i) Reflects a fair value adjustment to WashingtonFirst’s interest-bearing deposit liabilities to account for current market interest

rates.
 

 
(j) Reflects a fair value adjustment to WashingtonFirst’s Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings to account for current market

interest rates and spreads for comparable instruments.
 

 
(k) Reflects a downward fair value adjustment to trust preferred debt acquired from WashingtonFirst in the total amount of $2.1

million. Also reflects an elimination of debt issuance placement fees on acquired subordinated debt and elimination of fair
value discount on previously acquired trust preferred debt by WashingtonFirst in the total amount of $2.6 million.

 

 (l) Reflects a fair value adjustment for WashingtonFirst’s operating leases.
 

 
(m) Adjustment reflects the elimination of the historical equity of WashingtonFirst. Sandy Spring will issue approximately

11,298,000 share of common stock (assuming stock price of $42.72) to former WashingtonFirst stockholders and pay
estimated $15.6 million in cash to WashingtonFirst option holders for a total consideration of $498.3 million.

 

 
(n) Adjustment reflects a fair value accretion on portfolio loans assuming the Transactions were consummated on January 1,

2016. This consists of $2.4 million and $5.3 million, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended
December 31, 2016 in accretable adjustments

to the credit mark on the acquired loans. Amortization of $2.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively, was also included for
the six months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016 related to interest rate adjustments on the
acquired loans. The average remaining life of the loans is approximately seven years. The adjustment also reflects the
elimination of acquired net deferred origination costs and fair value adjustments from previous acquisitions in the total
amount of $520 thousand and $1.1 million that was included for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended
December 31, 2016, respectively.

 

 

(o) Adjustment reflects a fair value accretion on available for sale securities (related to unrealized loss of WashingtonFirst’s
available for sale securities) assuming the Transactions were consummated on January 1, 2016. This consists of accretion of
$370 thousand and $862 thousand, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31,
2016. The average remaining life of the securities is approximately 7 years.

 

 

(p) Adjustment reflects amortization of the discount on acquired WashingtonFirst’s certificates of deposit assuming the
Transactions were consummated on January 1, 2016. The estimated amount of amortization is $62 thousand for the six
months ended June 30, 2017 and $249 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. The amount was estimated based off
the sum-of-the-years digits method assuming two years remaining life on the assumed acquisition date of January 1, 2016.

 

 

(q) Adjustment reflects accretion of the premium on acquired WashingtonFirst’s Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings assuming
the Transactions were consummated on January 1, 2016. The estimated amount of accretion is $59 thousand for the six
months ended June 30, 2017 and $117 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. The amount was estimated based off
the straight line amortization method assuming three years remaining life on the assumed acquisition date of January 1,
2016. The adjustment also reflects a fair value accretion related to acquired placement fees on trust preferred securities in the
total amount of $134 thousand and $268 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and year ended December 31,
2016, respectively. In addition, the adjustment also reflects fair value amortization on acquired trust preferred debt in the
total amount of $38 thousand and $70 thousand for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31,
2016, respectively.

 

 

(r) Adjustment reflects fair value accretion on acquired operating leases assuming the Transactions were consummated on
January 1, 2016. This consists of accretion of $50 thousand and $100 thousand, respectively, for the six months ended June
30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016. The adjustment also reflects fair value accretion on written-off obsolete
equipment in the total amount of $75 thousand and $150 thousand, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and
the year ended December 31, 2016. These accretion amounts were calculated using straight line amortization method
assuming five year remaining life on the assumed acquisition date of January 1, 2016.

 

 

(s) Adjustment reflects the amortization amount of the core deposit intangible and asset management list intangible to be
acquired in the Transactions over an estimated useful life of 10 years using the sum-of-the-years digits method assuming the
Transactions were consummated on January 1, 2016. The estimated amount of the core deposit intangible amortization is
$614 thousand and $1.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.
The estimated amount of the asset management customer list intangible amortization is $164 thousand and $364 thousand
for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. The adjustment also reflects
accretion of eliminated legacy WashingtonFirst’s other intangibles totaling $156 thousand and $310 thousand for the six
months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. This accretion was based on the straight
line amortization method using a five year estimated remaining life on the assumed acquisition date of January 1, 2016.

 

 (t) Reflects an applicable income tax rate of 35% related to fair value pro forma adjustments.

(u) The pro forma combined basic and diluted earnings per share for each period presented are calculated as the pro forma
combined net income for the relevant period divided by the weighted average number of Sandy Spring common shares
outstanding during that period, as adjusted for the assumed issuance of a total of 11,298,000 shares of Sandy Spring common
stock to WashingtonFirst stockholders in connection with the Transactions, effective as of January 1, 2016. The pro forma

(v) Book value per share equals the pro forma combined total stockholders’ equity as of the date presented divided by the
number of shares of Sandy Spring common stock outstanding as of the date presented, as adjusted to give effect to the
assumed issuance of 11,298,000 shares of Sandy Spring common stock to WashingtonFirst stockholders in connection with
the Transactions, effective as of January 1, 2016.

Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure. Sandy Spring’s management believes that such
information is important information to be provided because it can be used, in conjunction with more traditional bank capital
ratios, to assess, on a pro forma basis, the combined companies’ capital adequacy without the effect of accumulated other
comprehensive loss, goodwill and other intangible assets and compare that capital adequacy with the capital adequacy of
other banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill and/or other intangible assets. Book value per common
share is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents,
as of the dates set forth below, on a pro forma combined basis, the total stockholders’ equity and tangible common equity of
the combined companies and presents a reconciliation of the pro forma combined tangible book value per common share
compared to the pro forma combined book value per common share:

Note E — Estimated Cost Savings and Transactions-Related Costs

Estimated cost savings, expected to approximate 39% of WashingtonFirst’s annualized pre-tax non-interest expenses, are
excluded from the pro forma analysis. Sandy Spring’s management currently expects to realize 80% in the first year after acquisition
and 100% in the subsequent year. Expenses from the Transactions directly attributable to a business combination have not yet been
expensed in the historical income statements or accrued in the historical balance sheets. Such expenses do not meet the continuing
impact criterion because they would not be expenses that the combined entity would expect to incur on an ongoing basis. As such, pro
forma adjustments have not been made to include those expenses in the pro forma income statements and have only been reflected in
the pro forma balance sheet as a pro forma adjustment to retained earnings. Pre-tax Transactions-related costs are estimated to be
approximately $25.8 million.

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS

If the first-step merger is completed, WashingtonFirst stockholders will be entitled to receive shares of Sandy Spring common
stock in exchange for their shares of WashingtonFirst common stock. Sandy Spring is organized under the laws of the State of
Maryland and WashingtonFirst is organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. As a result of the integrated mergers,
WashingtonFirst stockholders will become stockholders of Sandy Spring. Thus, following the integrated mergers, the rights of
WashingtonFirst stockholders who become Sandy Spring stockholders as a result of the integrated mergers will be governed by the
corporate law of the State of Maryland and will also then be governed by Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation and Sandy Spring’s
bylaws. Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation and bylaws will be unaltered by the merger.

The following is a summary of the material differences between (1) the current rights of WashingtonFirst stockholders under the
VSCA, WashingtonFirst’s articles of incorporation and WashingtonFirst’s bylaws and (2) the current rights of Sandy Spring
stockholders under the Maryland General Corporation Law (which we refer to as the “MGCL” in this section), Sandy Spring’s articles
of incorporation and Sandy Spring’s bylaws. Sandy Spring and WashingtonFirst believe that this summary describes the material
differences between the rights of Sandy Spring stockholders as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the rights of
WashingtonFirst stockholders as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus; however, it does not purport to be a complete
description of those differences. Copies of Sandy Spring’s and WashingtonFirst’s governing documents have been filed with the SEC. To
find out where copies of these documents can be obtained, see the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “Where You
Can Find More Information” beginning on page 150.

SANDY SPRING   WASHINGTONFIRST
Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation authorize the Sandy Spring
board, without further stockholder action, to classify and reclassify
any unissued shares of capital stock into a class or classes of
preferred stock and to provide for the issuance of the shares of
preferred stock in series, and by filing articles supplementary to the
articles of incorporation pursuant to the applicable law of the State of
Maryland, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be
included in each such series, and to fix the designation, powers,
preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and any
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof.

Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation currently provide that the
number of directors of Sandy Spring may be increased or decreased
by the Sandy Spring board from time to time pursuant to the Sandy
Spring bylaws, except that the number may never be less than the
minimum number permitted by the MGCL (i.e., one director) or
greater than 15 (exclusive of directors, if any, to be elected by
holders of preferred stock of Sandy Spring, voting separately as a
class). The Sandy Spring bylaws further provide that the Sandy
Spring board may increase or decrease the number of directors by a
majority vote between annual stockholder meetings within the limits
described above, provided that no decrease in the number of
directors may shorten the term of any incumbent director. Sandy
Spring’s articles of incorporation establish a classified board by
which the board is divided into three classes of directors, which shall
be as nearly equal in number as possible, that are elected for three-
year terms (after the initial term of the board).
 
Under the merger agreement, Sandy Spring will increase the size of
its board to fifteen members and appoint Joseph S. Bracewell, Shaza
L. Andersen and two other current members of the WashingtonFirst
board to the Sandy Spring board.   

WashingtonFirst’s articles of incorporation currently provides
the number of directors of WashingtonFirst shall be not be less
than three nor more than 25, with the exact number to be stated
in the WashingtonFirst bylaws. WashingtonFirst’s bylaws
provide that the board shall consist of a minimum of five and a
maximum of 25 individuals. The WashingtonFirst articles of
incorporation state that the number of directors shall not be
reduced as to shorten the term of any director then in office.
WashingtonFirst’s articles of incorporation further provide that
the directors shall be divided into three classes, which shall be
as nearly equal in number as possible, and which shall serve
staggered terms such that each class is considered for election
at an annual meeting once every three years.

DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS

Under Sandy Spring’s bylaws, as in effect on the date of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus, no person is eligible for election or
appointment to the board if under 21 or over 70 years of age at the

her 70th birthday.   

Under WashingtonFirst bylaws, directors need not be residents
of Virginia.

SANDY SPRING   WASHINGTONFIRST
As of the completion of the first-step merger, Sandy Spring’s bylaws
will be amended to provide that (i) the general maximum age
limitation discussed above will be raised from 70 to 72 and (ii) a
director may, at the request of the Sandy Spring board’s nominating
committee (and if ratified by the board), continue to serve as a
director after the annual stockholder meeting immediately following
his or her 72nd birthday if (A) he or she was appointed to the Sandy
Spring board in connection with a corporate acquisition,
consolidation, or merger and (B) the nominating committee and
board determine that his or her continued service would be a
substantial benefit to Sandy Spring in recognizing the benefit of such
acquisition, consolidation or merger. The nominating committee,
subject to the approval of the board, will determine the period of
continuation of such person’s service as a director.
 
Under the merger agreement, pursuant to the above paragraph,
Sandy Spring will nominate Joseph S. Bracewell as a Class I director
with a term expiring in 2021, which will be the annual stockholder
meeting immediately following his 74th birthday.   

Sandy Spring’s bylaws further provide that each director must be the
holder of unencumbered or unhypothecated shares of common stock
of Sandy Spring having an aggregate par value of $1,000 or fair
market value of $1,000. A director of Sandy Spring may not serve as

entitled to vote in the director election (considered for this purpose
as one class) cast at a meeting of the stockholders called for that
purpose, subject to applicable provisions of federal law and the
rights of the holders of any class separately entitled to elect one or
more directors. A director may only be removed by vote of
stockholders after service of specific charges, adequate notice, and
full opportunity to refute the charges.   

Under WashingtonFirst’s bylaws, any director may be
removed, with or without cause, at a meeting of stockholders
called and noticed expressly for that purpose, if the number of
votes cast to remove him or her constitutes a majority of the
votes entitled to be cast at an election of directors.

SANDY SPRING   WASHINGTONFIRST

STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

The Sandy Spring bylaws provide that any action required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of stockholders may be taken
without a meeting if a unanimous written consent to the action is
signed by each stockholder entitled to vote on the matter and a
written waiver of any rights to dissent is signed by each stockholder
entitled to notice but not entitled to vote at the meeting. The
unanimous written consent and the written waiver, if any, shall be
filed with the records of the Sandy Spring stockholders’ meetings.

  

Notwithstanding that WashingtonFirst’s organizational
documents do not contemplate stockholder action by written
consent, Section 13.1-657 of the VSCA provides that action
required or permitted by the VSCA to be adopted or taken at a
stockholders’ meeting may be adopted or taken without a
meeting if the action is adopted or taken by all the stockholders
entitled to vote on the action. Such unanimous consent must be
evidenced by written consent describing the action taken and
given (in writing or by electronic transmission) by all the
stockholders entitled to vote on the action, and filed in the
minutes or corporate records of the stockholders’ meetings.

NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER MEETING

Sandy Spring’s bylaws provide that written or printed notice shall be
given, not less than 10 nor more than 90 days before the date on
which the meeting is to be held to each stockholder entitled to vote at
the meeting and each other stockholder entitled to notice of the
meeting.
 
When any stockholder meeting is adjourned, notice of the place,
time or business to be transacted at such adjourned meeting need not
be given if announced at the meeting at which such adjournment is
taken; provided, however, that if any meeting is adjourned for more
than 30 days, then notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as
in the case of an original meeting.
 
At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is represented, any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the
original meeting.

  

WashingtonFirst’s bylaws provide that written notice shall be
given either by personal delivery or by mail, by or at the
direction of the officer or persons calling the meeting, not more
than 60 days nor less than 10 days before the date of the
meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting.
Notwithstanding the above, such notice shall be given to each
stockholder, whether or not entitled to vote, not less than 25
days before a meeting called to act on certain transactions
including an amendment to the articles, a plan of merger or
share exchange, a proposed sale, lease, exchange or other
disposition of all, or substantially all, of the property of
WashingtonFirst outside the ordinary course of business, or the
dissolution of WashingtonFirst.
 
When any stockholder meeting is adjourned, notice of the date,
time, place or purpose(s) of the adjourned meeting need not be
given other than by announcement at the meeting at which the
adjournment is taken, provided, however, that if any meeting is
adjourned for more than 120 days, then notice of the adjourned
meeting shall be given as in the case of the original meeting.
 
At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted
at the meeting as originally called.

SANDY SPRING   WASHINGTONFIRST

ADVANCE NOTICE OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

Sandy Spring’s bylaws provide that in addition to any other
applicable requirements for business to be properly brought before
an annual meeting by a stockholder, a stockholder must give timely
written notice thereof to the Secretary of Sandy Spring. To be timely,
a stockholder’s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at
the principal executive offices of Sandy Spring not less than 30 nor
more than 90 days before the date of any such annual meeting of
stockholders; provided, however, that if less than 45 days’ notice of
the date of the meeting is given to stockholders, such notice by a
stockholder must be received by the Secretary not later than the close
of business on the 15th day following the day on which notice of the
date of the meeting was mailed to stockholders or two days before
the date of the meeting, whichever is earlier. Each such notice given
by a stockholder to the Secretary with respect to business proposals
to be brought before a meeting shall set forth (a) a brief description
of the business and the reasons for conducting such business at the
meeting, (b) the name and address, as they appear on Sandy Spring’s
books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (c) the class and
number of shares of Sandy Spring that are beneficially owned by the
stockholder, and (d) any material interest of the stockholder in such
business. Stockholder proposals that do not satisfy the requirements
described above, may be considered and discussed but not acted
upon at an annual meeting.   

WashingtonFirst’s bylaws provide that any stockholder entitled
to vote in the election of directors generally may submit
proposals for consideration at the annual meeting of
stockholders of WashingtonFirst, but only if written notice of
such stockholder’s intent to submit such proposal(s) has been
received, either by personal delivery or United States mail,
postage prepaid, by the President of WashingtonFirst not less
than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the initial
notice given to stockholders of record on the record date for the
previous annual meeting; provided, however, that if the annual
meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the date
of the previous year’s annual meeting, such notice must be
received by the President of WashingtonFirst not less than 90
days nor more than 120 days prior to the date set forth for such
annual meeting of stockholders. The Chairman at the meeting
may refuse to acknowledge the proposal by any person that is
not made in compliance with the above requirements.
 
WashingtonFirst is not required to include any stockholder
proposal in WashingtonFirst’s proxy materials for its annual
meeting unless the proponent has complied with the
requirements of applicable federal and state law, which include
the written notice requirements described above.

DISSENTERS’ OR APPRAISAL RIGHTS

Under the MGCL, a stockholder of a Maryland corporation is
generally entitled to dissent from, and demand payment of the fair
value of their shares in connection with, a merger, consolidation,
share exchange, asset transfer or business combination that
substantially adversely alters such stockholder’s rights (determined
as of the date of the meeting at which such transaction is approved,
without reference to any appreciation or depreciation in value
resulting from such transaction or its proposal) subject to specified
procedural requirements. Sections 3-201 through 3-213 of the
MGCL set forth the procedures a stockholder requesting payment for
his, her or its shares must   

The VSCA provides that stockholders of a Virginia corporation
are generally entitled to object and receive payment of the fair
value of the shares they hold in the event of any of the
following corporate actions: (i) a merger if stockholder
approval is required and the stockholders are entitled to vote on
the merger; (ii) a share exchange, if the stockholders are
entitled to vote on the share exchange; (iii) disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the corporation, if the
stockholders are entitled to vote on the disposition; or (iv) an
amendment to the articles of incorporation that reduces the
number of shares owned by the stockholders to a fraction of a

follow, which generally include (i) filing with such Maryland
corporation, at or before the meeting to vote on the proposed
transaction, a written objection to the proposed transaction; and (ii)
refraining from voting for or consenting to the proposal to approve
the proposed transaction; and (iii) within a specified time period,
delivering to such Maryland corporation a written demand for
payment with respect to such dissenting shares stating the number
and class of shares for which payment is demanded. The MGCL
does not confer appraisal rights, however, if the corporation’s stock
is either (i) listed on a national securities exchange; or (ii) is not
entitled to vote on the transaction; or (iii) the subject of a special
provision of the charter of such Maryland corporation which
provides that the holders of such stock are not entitled to appraisal
rights.
 
The MGCL further provides that no appraisal rights shall be
available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation
surviving a merger unless either (i) the merger alters the contract
rights of the stock as expressly set forth in the corporation’s charter
and the charter does not reserve the right to do so; or (ii) such stock
will be converted into something other than either stock in the
successor or cash.
 
The above discussion is not a complete statement of the law relating
to appraisal rights under the MGCL, and the applicable sections of
the MGCL should be reviewed carefully by any stockholder who
wishes to exercise dissenters’ rights or who wishes to preserve the
right to do so.

  

share if the corporation has the obligation or right to repurchase
the fractional shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the VSCA
further provides that appraisal rights are not available to a
holder of shares of any class or series of shares of a Virginia
corporation when the stock is either (x) listed on a national
securities exchange such as Nasdaq Stock Market or (y) traded
on an organized market, held by at least 2,000 stockholders of
record and has a public float of at least $20 million. Because
WashingtonFirst common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital
Market, the holders of WashingtonFirst common stock are not
entitled to dissenters’ rights. WashingtonFirst non-voting
common stock is not listed on any exchange and, thus, this
exception does not apply to holders of WashingtonFirst non-
voting common stock.
 
Each holder of WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock
which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time and which is owned by a holder who (i) does not
vote or permit any of his, her or its shares to be voted in favor
of the WashingtonFirst merger proposal, and (ii) pursuant to
Section 13.1-729 et seq. of the VSCA, duly and validly
exercises and perfects his, her or its appraisal rights with
respect to his, her or its shares of WashingtonFirst non-voting
common stock, will have the right to assert appraisal rights
with respect to their respective dissenting shares of
WashingtonFirst non-voting common stock and demand in
writing to be paid the fair value of their shares under applicable
provisions of Virginia law following consummation of the
integrated mergers by Sandy Spring as the surviving company
following the integrated mergers.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Sandy Spring has not opted out of the requirements which it is
subject to under Section 3-602 of the MGCL. The MGCL prohibits
certain future acquirors of 10% or more of Sandy Spring’s common
stock (“interested stockholders”), and their affiliates from engaging
in business combinations (as defined below) with Sandy Spring for a
period of five years after such acquisition. After the five-year period,
a business combination with an interested stockholder or affiliate
thereof must be   

WashingtonFirst has not opted out of the requirements which it
is subject to under the Affiliated Transaction Statute of the
VSCA, which contains restrictions on “affiliated transactions”
including mergers, share exchanges, sales, leases, or other
dispositions of material assets, issuances of securities,
dissolutions, and similar transactions with an “interested
stockholder.” An interested stockholder is generally the
beneficial owner of more

recommended by the board of directors and may occur only: (i) with
a vote of 80% of the voting stock (including two-thirds of the stock
not held by the interested stockholder and its affiliates); or (ii) if
certain stringent fair price tests are met. A “business combination” is
broadly defined in the MGCL to include mergers, consolidations,
certain share exchanges, asset transfers and other transactions,
subject to certain exceptions. The MGCL does not preclude or
restrict any business combination with an interested stockholder if
the board of directors approves or exempts the transaction before
such person becomes an interested stockholder.
 
Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation provide that a business
combination with an interested stockholder or “controlling party”
(generally defined as a person that owns or controls 20% or more of
the outstanding voting stock) must be approved by the holders of (a)
at least 80% of the outstanding shares of voting stock and (b) at least
67% of the outstanding shares of voting stock held by stockholders
other than such interested stockholder. The super-majority vote is not
required for a business combination with an interested stockholder
that is approved by a majority of disinterested directors or meets
certain consideration value requirements.
 
Sandy Spring is also subject to the provisions of the Maryland
Control Share Act which causes persons who acquire beneficial
ownership of stock at levels of 10%, 33% and more than 50%
(“control share acquisitions”) to lose the voting rights of such stock
unless voting rights are restored by the stockholders at a meeting by
vote of two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter
(excluding stock held by the acquiring stockholder or Sandy Spring’s
officers or employee directors). The Control Share Act affords a
cash-out election (at an appraised value) for stockholders other than
the acquiring stockholder, payable by Sandy Spring, if the acquiring
stockholder is given voting rights for more than 50% of the
outstanding stock. Under certain circumstances, Sandy Spring may
redeem shares acquired in a control share acquisition if voting rights
for such shares have not been approved.
 
In addition, Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation require a
supermajority vote of 80% of the outstanding shares of voting stock
to authorize a merger or consolidation of Sandy Spring with, or a
sale, exchange or lease of all or substantially all of the assets of
Sandy

  

than 10% of any class of a corporation’s outstanding voting
shares. During the three years following the date a stockholder
becomes an interested stockholder, any affiliated transaction
with the interested stockholder must be approved by both a
majority (but not less than two) of the “disinterested directors”
(those directors who were directors before the interested
stockholder became an interested stockholder or who were
recommended for election by a majority of disinterested
directors) and by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-
thirds of the corporation’s voting shares other than shares
beneficially owned by the interested stockholder. These
requirements do not apply to affiliated transactions if, among
other things, a majority of the disinterested directors approve
the interested stockholder’s acquisition of voting shares making
such a person an interested stockholder before such acquisition.
Beginning three years after the stockholder becomes an
interested stockholder, the corporation may engage in an
affiliated transaction if: (i) approved by the holders of two-
thirds of the corporation’s voting shares, other than those
owned by the interested stockholder; (ii) approved by a
majority of the disinterested directors; or (iii) subject to certain
additional requirements, in the affiliated transaction the holders
of each class or series of voting shares will receive
consideration meeting specified fair price and other
requirements designed to ensure that all stockholders receive
fair and equivalent consideration, regardless of when they
tendered their shares.
 
The WashingtonFirst articles of incorporation provide that
certain transactions (including a plan of merger or share
exchange, a transaction involving the sale of all or substantially
all of WashingtonFirst’s assets other than in the regular course
of business, and a plan of dissolution) need only be approved
by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by each voting
group of stockholders entitled to vote thereon as long as such
transaction is approved by at least two-thirds of the directors in
office. If two-thirds of the directors have not approved such
transaction, then a supermajority stockholder vote of 80% or
more of all votes entitled to be cast is required to approve the
transaction.

transaction is recommended by at least a majority of the entire board
of directors. “Substantially all of the assets” is defined to mean
assets having a fair market value or book value, whichever is greater,
of 25% or more of the total assets of Sandy Spring. Additionally,
Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation also require that the
presence in person or by proxy of 80% of the outstanding shares is
required to constitute a quorum at any meeting at which a vote in
favor of a reverse stock split or merger or consolidation of Sandy
Spring with, or a sale, exchange or lease of substantially all of the
assets of Sandy Spring to, any person or entity that is not
recommended by the board of directors by the required vote
applicable to the proposed transaction under the articles of Sandy
Spring will be considered. Such a meeting may not be adjourned
with notice if a quorum is not present. In the event any shares of
Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, Sandy Spring’s articles
supplementary require, in addition to any other stockholder vote
requirement under law or the articles, the vote or consent of at least
2/3 of the holders of Sandy Spring Series A Preferred Stock to
approve any binding share exchange or reclassification involving the
Sandy Spring Series A Preferred Stock, or any merger or
consolidation of Sandy Spring with another corporation or entity,
unless in each case the shares of Sandy Spring Series A Preferred
Stock remain outstanding or, are converted into or exchanged for
preference securities of the surviving entity of a merger (or its
ultimate parent) with rights that are not materially less favorable to
the holders thereof.
 
Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation
with a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act
and at least three independent directors to elect to be subject, by
provision in its charter or bylaws or a resolution of its board of
directors and notwithstanding any contrary provision in the charter
or bylaws, to any or all of five provisions of the MGCL which
provide, respectively, for: (i) a classified board; (ii) a two-thirds vote
(of all stock entitled to vote thereon) requirement for removing a
director; (iii) a requirement that the number of directors be fixed
only by vote of the board of directors; (iv) a requirement that a
vacancy on the board be filled only by the remaining directors and
for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which
the vacancy occurred; or (v) a majority requirement for the calling of
a special meeting of stockholders. Sandy Spring has not elected to be  

VSCA’s Control Share Acquisitions Statute, which require
voting rights of shares of stock of a Virginia corporation
acquired by an acquiring person or other entity at ownership
levels of 20%, 33 1/3%, and 50% of the outstanding shares
may, under certain circumstances, be denied. The voting rights
may be denied: (i) unless conferred by a special stockholder
vote of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote for
directors, other than shares held by the acquiring person and
officers and directors of the corporation; or (ii) among other
exceptions, such acquisition of shares is made pursuant to a
merger agreement with the corporation or the corporation’s
articles of incorporation or bylaws permit the acquisition of
such shares before the acquiring person’s acquisition thereof. If
authorized in the corporation’s articles of incorporation or
bylaws, the statute also permits the corporation to redeem the
acquired shares at the average per share price paid for such
shares if the voting rights are not approved or if the acquiring
person does not file a “control share acquisition statement”
with the corporation within 60 days of the last acquisition of
such shares. If voting rights are approved for control shares
comprising more than 50% of the corporation’s outstanding
stock, objecting stockholders may have the right to have their
shares repurchased by the corporation for “fair value.”

subject to any of the provisions of Subtitle 8. Through provisions in
the articles unrelated to Subtitle 8, Sandy Spring already requires a
classified board and that the number of directors be fixed by a vote
of the board of directors.   

LIMITATION OF PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation provide that an officer or
director of Sandy Spring shall not be personally liable to Sandy
Spring or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of their
fiduciary duty as a director or officer, except for liability: (i) for
actually receiving an improper benefit or profit in money, property or
services from Sandy Spring (to the extent proven), or (ii) from an
adverse judgment or other final adjudication based on a finding that
the individual’s action, or failure to act, was the result of active and
deliberate dishonesty and was material to the cause of action
adjudicated.

  

WashingtonFirst’s articles of incorporation provide that to the
full extent that the VSCA permits the limitation or elimination
of the liability of directors or officers, a director or officer of
WashingtonFirst shall not be liable to WashingtonFirst or its
stockholders for monetary damages.
 
Section 13.1-692.1 of the VSCA states that in any proceeding
brought by or in the right of a corporation or by its
stockholders, damages assessed against a director or officer
arising out of a single transaction, occurrence or course of
conduct cannot exceed the lesser of: (a) the monetary amount,
including the complete elimination of liability, specified in the
charter or, if approved by the stockholders, in the bylaws as a
limitation on the liability of the officer or director; or (b) the
greater of (i) $100,000 or (ii) the amount of cash compensation
received by the director or officer from the corporation during
the 12 months preceding the relevant act or omission.
However, such limitation on liability will not apply if the
officer or director engaged in willful misconduct or a knowing
violation of any criminal law or any federal or state securities
law.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS AND INSURANCE

Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation provide that subject to
applicable provisions of federal law, Sandy Spring will indemnify to
the fullest extent permissible under the MGCL any individual who is
or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of Sandy Spring, and
any individual who serves or served at Sandy Spring’s request as a
director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, in
any proceeding in which the individual is made a party as a result of
his service in such capacity. Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation
further provide that an individual will not be indemnified if (i) it is
established that the act or omission at issue was material to the
matter giving rise to the proceeding and (a) was committed in bad
faith, or   

Under the WashingtonFirst articles of incorporation,
WashingtonFirst will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted
by the VSCA, any current or former director or officer (and
their respective heirs, executors and administrators) who is a
party to any proceeding by reason of having served as a
director or officer of WashingtonFirst or as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another entity at the request of
WashingtonFirst. WashingtonFirst may by a majority vote of a
quorum of the disinterested directors cause WashingtonFirst to
indemnify any other person who is a party to a proceeding by
reason of having served as an employee or agent of
WashingtonFirst or having served as an employee or agent of
another entity at the request of WashingtonFirst.

(b) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty; (ii) the
individual actually received an improper personal benefit in money,
property, or services; or (iii) in the case of a criminal proceeding, the
individual had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission
was unlawful.
 
The rights of indemnification provided for in the Sandy Spring
articles of incorporation are not exclusive of any other rights to
which those indemnified may be entitled under any bylaw,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or
otherwise. Rights of indemnification under the articles of
incorporation continue as to a person who has ceased to serve in one
of the capacities listed in the this section and inure to the benefit of
the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.

  

WashingtonFirst is required to indemnify any director or officer
who entirely prevails in the defense of any proceeding to which
he was a party because he is or was a director or officer of
WashingtonFirst against reasonable expenses incurred by him
in connection with such proceeding.
 
WashingtonFirst may purchase and maintain insurance to
indemnify it against the whole or any portion of the liability
assumed under the indemnification provisions of the articles of
incorporation and may procure insurance for current or former
directors, officers, employees or agents of Washington first, or
individuals serving in those capacities at other entities at
WashingtonFirst’s request against liability arising from such
service regardless of whether WashingtonFirst would be able to
indemnify such person.

INSPECTION OF BOOKS AND RECORDS

Under MGCL Sections 512 and 513, any stockholder making a
written demand may inspect and copy during usual business hours
the following corporate documents: bylaws, minutes of the
proceedings of the stockholders, annual statements of affairs, voting
trust agreements deposited with the corporation and a statement
showing all stock and securities issued by the corporation during the
prior 12 months. Additionally, upon written request, one or more
persons who together are and for at least six months have been
stockholders of record of at least 5% of the outstanding stock of any
class of a corporation may inspect and copy during regular business
hours the corporation’s accounting books and stock ledger.

  

Under Virginia law, a stockholder of a corporation is entitled to

location specified by the corporation, any of the following
records of the corporation if the stockholder meets the
requirements below and gives the corporation written notice of
the stockholder’s demand at least five business days before the
date on which the stockholder wishes to inspect and copy: (i)
excerpts from minutes of any meeting of the board of directors
or a committee of the board of directors while acting in place
of the board of directors on behalf of the corporation, minutes
of any meeting of the stockholders, and records of action taken
by the stockholders, board of directors, or a committee of the
board without a meeting; (ii) accounting records of the

the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, at the

meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held.

AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS
 
Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation and bylaws provide that, in
addition to the powers conferred by the MGCL or other statute, the
Sandy Spring board may make, repeal, alter, amend and rescind the
bylaws of Sandy Spring. Notwithstanding any other provision of the
Sandy Spring organizational document or the fact that some lesser
percentage may be specified by law, the bylaws shall not be made,
repealed, altered, amended or rescinded by the stockholders of Sandy
Spring except by the vote of the holders of not less than 80% of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Sandy Spring entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors (considered for this purpose as
one class) cast at a meeting of the stockholders called for that
purpose (provided that notice of such proposed adoption, repeal,
alteration, amendment or rescission is included in the notice of such
meeting) or by a majority vote of the board.
 
Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation authorize Sandy Spring to
repeal, alter, amend or rescind any provision contained in the articles
of incorporation in the manner prescribed by law, and all rights
conferred on stockholders herein are granted subject to this
reservation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the affirmative vote of at
80% of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote
(considered for this purpose as one class) cast at a stockholder
meeting called for that purpose shall be required to amend certain
sections of Sandy Spring’s articles of incorporation, including
provisions relating to (i) authorization of issuance of stock; (ii)
directors; (iii) approval of certain transactions; (iv) approval of
business combinations with controlling parties; (v) evaluation of
business combinations; and (vi) amendment of articles of
incorporation.   

WashingtonFirst bylaws provide that the bylaws may be
amended or repealed by the board except to the extent that: (i)
this power is reserved exclusively to the stockholders by law or
the articles of incorporation; or (ii) the stockholders in adopting
or amending particular bylaws provide expressly that the board
may not amend or repeal the same. These bylaws may be
amended or repealed by the stockholders even though the same
also may be amended or repealed by the board.
 
The WashingtonFirst articles of incorporation provide that an
amendment of the WashingtonFirst articles of incorporation
may be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares entitled to vote on the transaction by each voting group
entitled to vote on the transaction, if the board has approved
and recommended the amendment by at least a two-thirds vote
of the directors currently in office. If the amendment is not
approved and recommended by at least two-thirds of the
directors currently in office, then the amendment must be
approved by the vote of 80% or more of all the votes entitled to

From time to time, individual stockholders of Sandy Spring may wish to submit proposals that they believe should be voted upon
by the stockholders. The SEC has adopted regulations that govern the inclusion of such proposals in Sandy Spring’s annual proxy
materials. Stockholder proposals intended to be presented at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders may be eligible for inclusion in
the proxy materials for that annual meeting if received at Sandy Spring’s executive offices not later than November 22, 2017 unless the
date of the 2018 annual meeting is more than 30 days from May 3, 2018, in which case the deadline is a reasonable time before Sandy
Spring begins to print and mail proxy materials. Any such proposals shall be subject to the requirements of the proxy rules adopted
under the Exchange Act.

In addition, Sandy Spring’s bylaws require that to be properly brought before an annual meeting, stockholder proposals for new
business must be delivered to or mailed and received by the secretary not less than thirty nor more than ninety days prior to the date of
the meeting; provided, however, that if less than forty-five days’ notice of the date of the meeting is given to stockholders, such notice
by a stockholder must be received not later than the fifteenth day following the date on which notice of the date of the meeting was

Agreement and Plan of Merger

This is an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 15, 2017 (“Agreement”), by and among Sandy Spring Bancorp,
Inc., a Maryland corporation (“Parent”), Touchdown Acquisition, Inc., a Virginia corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
(“Merger Sub”), and WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the “Company”).

Introductory Statement

The Board of Directors of each of Parent and the Company have determined that this Agreement and the business combination
and related transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
stockholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for herein, pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub will,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into the Company (the “First-Step Merger”), so that the Company
is the surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and (ii) immediately thereafter, the
Company, as the surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger, will merge (the “Second-Step Merger” and, together with the First-
Step Merger, the “Integrated Mergers”) with and into Parent, with Parent being the surviving corporation.

The parties hereto intend that the Integrated Mergers shall together be treated as a single integrated transaction that qualifies as a
“reorganization” under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “IRC”) and that this
Agreement is intended to be, and is adopted as, a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the IRC and
within the meaning of Treasury regulation section 1.368-2(g).

Parent and the Company each desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the business
combination and related transactions provided for herein and to prescribe various conditions to such transactions.

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a condition and inducement to Parent’s willingness to enter
into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company have entered into an agreement pursuant to which each such stockholder has

successor thereto, through its “volume weighted average price” function (or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source

to herein as the “Merger Consideration.”

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock and no

Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent,
determined by multiplying such fraction by the Parent Average Price.

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or into a different class by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted appropriately to
provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(d) As of the Effective Time, each Excluded Share shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no exchange or
payment shall be made with respect thereto.

Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by
the First-Step Merger.

1.7 Effect on Outstanding Shares of Common Stock of Merger Sub. At and after the Effective Time, each share of the
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be

Corporation.

1.8 Articles of Incorporation of Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company,
as the surviving corporation in the First-Step Merger, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time and attached hereto as Exhibit B, until such Articles of Incorporation are thereafter amended in accordance
with their terms and applicable law.

Company Stock Plan or assumed by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company Stock Option”) shall, automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Company Stock Option to receive (without interest),
no later than the first payroll period following the Effective Time and in any event no later than thirty (30) calendar days following the
Closing Date, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such

any, of (A) the Equity Award Cash-out Price over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Stock
Option less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock
Option which has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is greater than or equal to the Equity Award Cash-out
Price shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Equity
Award Cash-out Price” means an amount equal to the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by (y) the Parent Average Price.

(b) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or
other lapse restriction granted under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company
Restricted Stock Award” and, together with the Company Stock Options, the “Company Equity Awards”) shall fully vest and shall
be converted into the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.5. Parent shall pay or
issue the consideration described in this Section 1.10(b) within five (5) business days following the Effective Time. Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Company Restricted Stock Awards all such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the IRC or any
provisions of state, local, or foreign Tax law.

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company and/or its compensation committee, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to (i) effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.10.,
including delivering written notice to each holder of a Company Equity Award of the treatment of such award pursuant to this
Section 1.10 and taking reasonable steps to obtain each such holder’s written acknowledgement and agreement of the treatment set
forth in this Section 1.10, in each case not less than 30 days prior to the Closing and (ii) cause the Company Stock Plans to terminate at
or prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or other capital stock of the
Company to any person pursuant to or in settlement of Company Equity Awards.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, “Company Stock Plans” means the WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc. 2010 Equity
Compensation Plan and the 1st Portfolio Holding Corporation 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.

1.11 Bank Merger. Concurrently with or as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Sandy Spring Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and WashingtonFirst Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
shall enter into the Plan of Bank Merger, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, pursuant to which WashingtonFirst Bank will merge
with and into Sandy Spring Bank (the “Bank Merger”). The parties intend that the Bank Merger will become effective simultaneously
with or immediately following the Effective Time.

1.12 Alternative Structure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time,
Parent may specify that the structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be revised and the parties shall enter into such
alternative transactions as Parent may reasonably determine to effect the purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that such
revised structure shall not (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, (ii) materially impede or delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) adversely limit or impact the qualification of the Integrated
Mergers as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the IRC. In the event that Parent elects to make such a revision,
the parties agree to execute appropriate documents to reflect the revised structure.

holders of certificates, or evidence of shares in book entry form, representing Company Common Stock (“Old Certificates”), for
exchange in accordance with this Article II, (a) certificates, or at Parent’s option, evidence of shares in book entry form, representing
the Parent Common Stock (“New Certificates”), to be given to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5 and
this Article II in exchange for outstanding shares of such Company Common Stock, and (b) to the extent then determinable, any cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.5(b) (such New Certificates and cash being hereinafter referred to as the
“Exchange Fund”). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, provided that no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Old Certificates. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, or as otherwise directed by Parent.

2.2 Exchange Procedures.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) business days
thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (a “Letter of Transmittal”) (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates
to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration which such holder shall have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject to, Section 1.5(a), and any cash
in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall
have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.2(c). From and after the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed Letter of Transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Old
Certificate or Old Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing the
Merger Consideration to which such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and
subject to, Section 1.5(a), and (ii) a check representing the amount of (1) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the
right to receive in respect of the surrendered Old Certificate or Old Certificates pursuant to Section 1.5(b) and (2) any dividends or
distributions which the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(c), and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders
of Old Certificates or any dividends payable under Section 2.2(c). Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

(b) The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or
distributed with respect to such shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto. If there is a transfer of ownership of any shares of
Company Common Stock not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration shall be issued to the
transferee thereof if the Old Certificates representing such Company Common Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required, in the reasonable judgment of Parent and the Exchange Agent, to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock
issued pursuant to this Agreement shall be remitted to any person entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock hereunder until
such person surrenders his or her Old Certificates in accordance with this Section 2.2. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws, upon the surrender of

such person’s Old Certificates, such person shall be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon,
which subsequent to the Effective Time had become payable but not paid with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented
by such person’s Old Certificates.

(d) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and from and after the
Effective Time there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer records of the Company of any shares of Company Common Stock
other than to settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old
Certificates are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.2.

(e) Any portion of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid pursuant to Section 1.5, any dividends or other distributions to be
paid pursuant to this Section 2.2 or any proceeds from any investments thereof that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the
Company for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be repaid by the Exchange Agent to Parent upon the written request of
Parent. After such request is made, any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.2 shall
look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and any unpaid dividends and distributions on
the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder holds, as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor
any party to this Agreement (or any affiliate thereof) shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any amount
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(f) Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the Company’s stock transfer books to establish the identity
of those persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a
dispute with respect to ownership of stock represented by any Old Certificate, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect
to any claims thereto.

(g) If any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, the posting by such
person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

2.3 Appraisal Rights.

(a) In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the VSCA, no appraisal rights shall be available to the holders of Company
Voting Common Stock.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and unless otherwise provided by applicable law, each share
of Company Non-Voting Common Stock which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which is owned
by a holder who (i) shall not have voted or caused or permitted any of his, her or its shares to be voted in favor of the First-Step
Merger, and (ii) pursuant to Section 13.1-729 et seq. of the VSCA, duly and validly exercises and perfects his, her or its appraisal rights
with respect to his, her or its shares of Company Non-Voting Common Stock (the “Dissenting Shares”), shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, but, instead, the holder thereof, with respect to such Dissenting Shares, shall be entitled to
payment in cash from the Surviving Corporation of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
the VSCA. If any such holder shall have failed to duly and validly exercise or perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
appraisal rights, each share of Company Non-Voting Common Stock of such holder as to which appraisal rights were not duly and
validly exercised or

shall thereafter be exchangeable only for the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. The Company
will provide Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Non-Voting
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served on and received by the Company pursuant
to Section 13.1-729 et seq. of the VSCA, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any demands for appraisal under the VSCA. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, settle or offer to settle any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any
such demands.

disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) and (ii) as
disclosed in disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub prior to the execution of this Agreement (the
“Company Disclosure Schedule”) (which schedule sets forth, among other things, facts, circumstances and events the disclosure of
which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an
exception to one or more of the representations and warranties contained in this Article III, or to one or more of the Company’s
covenants contained in Articles V or VI (and making specific reference to the Section of this Agreement to which they relate);
provided, that (x) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result
in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (y) the mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company that such item represents a
material exception or fact, circumstance or event or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and
(z) disclosure in any paragraph of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall apply only to the indicated Section of this Agreement except
to the extent that it is reasonably clear on the face of such disclosure that it is relevant to another paragraph of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or another Section of this Agreement), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

3.1 Organization and Qualification. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, is registered with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal
Reserve”) as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”), and has not
elected to be treated as a financial holding company under the BHC Act. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct the business currently being conducted by it. The Company is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the
properties owned or leased by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, “Material Adverse Effect” shall mean an effect, circumstance,
occurrence or change which is material and adverse to the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company or
Parent, as the context may dictate, and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, however, that any such effect, circumstance,
occurrence or change resulting from any (i) changes in laws, rules or regulations or GAAP or regulatory accounting requirements or
interpretations thereof that apply to financial and/or depository institutions and/or their holding companies generally, (ii) changes in
economic conditions affecting financial institutions generally, including but not limited to, changes in the general level of market
interest rates, (iii) actions and omissions of Parent or the Company taken with the prior written consent, or at the request, of the other,

this Agreement, (v) changes in national or international political or social conditions including the engagement by the United States in
hostilities, whether or not pursuant to the declaration of a national emergency or war, or the occurrence of any military or terrorist
attack upon or within the United States, and (vi) any failure, in and of itself, by Parent or the Company to meet any internal or
published projections, forecasts, estimates, or predictions in respect of revenues, earnings, or other financial or operating metrics for
any period (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such failure may be deemed to constitute,
or be taken into account in determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to become, a Material Adverse Effect,
to the extent permitted by this definition and not otherwise excepted by a clause of this proviso) shall not be considered in determining
if a Material Adverse Effect has occurred except, with respect to clauses (i), (ii) and (v), to the extent that the effects of such change
disproportionately affect such party and its Subsidiaries as compared to comparable U.S. banking organizations. The Company engages
only in activities (and holds properties only of the types) permitted to bank holding companies by the BHC Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder.

3.2 Subsidiaries.

(a) Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth with respect to each of the Company’s direct and indirect
Subsidiaries its name, its jurisdiction of incorporation, the Company’s percentage ownership, the number of shares of stock or other
equity interests owned or controlled by the Company and the name and number of shares held by any other person who owns any stock
of the Subsidiary. As used in this Agreement, the word “Subsidiary” when used with respect to any party, means any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, bank, trust or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is
(i) consolidated with such party for financial reporting purposes or (ii) directly or indirectly (through one or more intermediaries)
controlled by or owned more than fifty percent (50%) by such party (for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the Company, the
statutory business trusts related to the trust preferred securities issued or assumed by the Company are Subsidiaries of the Company).
The Company owns of record and beneficially all the capital stock or other equity interests of each of its Subsidiaries free and clear of
any charge, mortgage, pledge, security interest, claim, lien or encumbrance (“Lien”). There are no contracts, commitments, agreements
or understandings relating to the Company’s right to vote or dispose of any equity securities of its Subsidiaries. The Company’s
ownership interest in each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to equity
investments by bank holding companies or Virginia-chartered banks.

(b) Each of the Company’s Subsidiaries is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or formation, has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to conduct the business
currently being conducted by it and is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to transact business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(c) The outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary have been validly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. No shares of capital stock of any Subsidiary of the Company are or may be required to be issued by virtue of any
options, warrants or other rights, no securities exist that are convertible into or exchangeable for shares of such capital stock or any
other debt or equity security of any Subsidiary, and there are no contracts, commitments, agreements or understandings of any kind for
the issuance of additional shares of capital stock or other debt or equity security of any Subsidiary or options, warrants or other rights
with respect to such securities.

(d) WashingtonFirst Bank is a Virginia-chartered bank. No Subsidiary of the Company other than WashingtonFirst Bank is
an “insured depository institution” as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended, and the applicable regulations
thereunder. WashingtonFirst Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) through the
Deposit Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by law.

parties thereto which would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

(b) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company, each Company Contract is valid and binding on the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force
and effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by
it to date under each Company Contract. To the Company’s knowledge each third-party counterparty to each Company Contract has in
all material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date under such Company Contract, and no event or
condition exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a material default on the part of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under any such Company Contract.

With respect to each item of Intellectual Property that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is licensed or authorized to use, the
license, sublicense or agreement covering such item is legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice alleging any interference,
infringement, misappropriation or violation with or of any intellectual property rights of a third party (including any claims that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries must license or refrain from using any intellectual property rights of a third party). To the
knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has interfered with, infringed upon, misappropriated or
otherwise come into conflict with any intellectual property rights of third parties and no third party has interfered with, infringed upon,
misappropriated or otherwise come into conflict with any intellectual property rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. For
purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property” means trademarks, service marks, brand names, internet domain names, logos,

employment, retention of independent contractors, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, and wages and hours.
There are no complaints, lawsuits, arbitrations, administrative proceedings, or other proceedings of any nature pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries brought by or on behalf of any applicant for
employment, any current or former employee, any person alleging to be a current or former employee, any class of the foregoing, or

termination of employment, or alleging any other discriminatory, wrongful or tortious conduct in connection with the employment
relationship. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or has ever been a party to, or is or has ever been bound by, any
collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization with respect to
its employees, nor is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of any proceeding asserting that it has committed an unfair
labor practice or seeking to compel it or any such Subsidiary to bargain with any labor organization as to wages and conditions of
employment nor, to the knowledge of the Company, has any such proceeding been threatened, nor is there any strike, other labor

3.19 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) Section 3.19(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Company Employee Plans. For purposes of this
Agreement, “Company Employee Plans” means all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”)), whether or not subject to ERISA, and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase,
restricted stock, stock unit, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement, severance or
other benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all retention, bonus, employment, termination, severance plans, programs or
arrangements or other contracts or agreements to or with respect to which the Company or any Subsidiary or any trade or business of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not incorporated, all of which together with the Company would be deemed a
“single employer” within the meaning of Section 4001 of ERISA (a “Company ERISA Affiliate”), is a party or has any current or
future obligation or that are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company ERISA
Affiliate for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer, director or independent contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Company ERISA Affiliate. There has been no announcement or commitment by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to create an additional Company Employee Plan, or to amend any Company Employee Plan, except for amendments
required by applicable Law or which do not materially increase the cost of such Company Employee Plan.

(b) The Company has previously delivered or made available to Parent true and complete copies of each Company
Employee Plan along with, where applicable, copies of and the following related documents, to the extent applicable: (i) the most
recent copy of any summary plan descriptions, amendments, modifications or material supplements to any such Company Employee
Plan, (ii) the annual report (Form 5500), if any, filed with the IRS for the last two (2) plan years, (iii) the most recently received IRS
determination letter, if any, relating to a Company Employee Plan, and (iv) the most recently prepared actuarial report for each
Company Employee Plan (if applicable) for each of the last two (2) years.

(c) Each Company Employee Plan has been established, operated and administered in all material respects in accordance
with its terms and the requirements of all applicable laws, including ERISA and the IRC. Since January 1, 2014, neither Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action to take corrective action or make a filing under any voluntary correction program of the
IRS, Department of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Company Employee Plan, and neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan defect that would qualify for correction under any such program.

(d) There is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened litigation, administrative action or proceeding
relating to any Company Employee Plan. All of the Company Employee Plans comply in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of ERISA, the IRC and other applicable laws. There has occurred no “prohibited transaction” (as defined in Section 406
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the IRC) with respect to the Company Employee Plans that is likely to result in the imposition of any
penalties or Taxes upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the IRC.

(e) The Company has never sponsored, implemented or participated in any defined benefit pension plan or multiple-
employer plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA.

(f) Section 3.19(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each Company Employee Plan that is an “employee
pension benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC (a
“Company Qualified Plan”). Each Company Qualified Plan has received a favorable determination letter or a prototype plan or
volume submitter plan advisory opinion letter from the IRS for the most recent applicable remedial amendment cycle, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there are no circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such letter. No Company Qualified Plan is
an “employee stock ownership plan” (as defined in Section 4975(e)(7) of the IRC).

(g) Each Company Employee Plan that is a “nonqualified deferred compensation plan” (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of
the IRC) and any award thereunder, in each case that is subject to Section 409A of the IRC, has (i) since January 1, 2005, been
maintained and operated, in all material respects, in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the IRC and IRS Notice 2005-1 and
(ii) since January 1, 2009, been, in all material respects, in documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the IRC.
Each Company Employee Plan which is an “employee pension benefit plan” within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA that is not
qualified under Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the IRC is exempt from Parts 2, 3, and 4 of Title I of ERISA as an unfunded plan that is
maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated
employees, pursuant to Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of ERISA and the Company has filed a “top hat” registration letter
with the Department of Labor for each such plan.

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations for post-retirement or post-employment benefits
under any Company Employee Plan that cannot be amended or terminated upon sixty (60) days’ notice or less without incurring any
liability thereunder, except for coverage required by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the IRC, or similar state laws, the
cost of which is borne by the insured individuals.

(i) All contributions required to be made with respect to any Company Employee Plan by applicable Law or by any plan
document or other contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Company
Employee Plan, for any period through the date hereof have been timely made or paid in full, or to the extent not required to be made
or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected in the financial statements of the Company. Each Company Employee
Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either (A) is funded through an insurance company contract
and is not a “welfare benefit fund” within the meaning of Section 419 of the IRC or (B) is unfunded.

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause or accelerate the vesting, exercisability or delivery of, increase in
the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit or result in any forgiveness of indebtedness to, any employee, officer,
director or individual independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any funding of or limitation on the
right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company
Employee Plan or related trust. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in
property, or in the form of benefits) by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an “excess parachute
payment” within the meaning of Section 280G of the IRC.

(k) No Company Employee Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the
IRC, or otherwise. The Company has made available to Parent preliminary copies of Section 280G calculations (whether or not final),
which to the best of its knowledge are true, correct and complete, with respect to any disqualified individual who is a “named executive
officer” of the Company as defined in Item 402 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

3.20 Real Property. The Company or a Company Subsidiary (a) has good and marketable title to all the real property reflected in
the latest audited balance sheet included in the Company SEC Reports as being owned by the Company or a Company Subsidiary or
acquired after the date thereof (except properties sold or otherwise disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of business)
(the “Company Owned Properties”), free and clear of all material Liens, except (i) statutory Liens securing payments not yet due,
(ii) Liens for real property Taxes not yet due and payable, (iii) easements, rights of way, and other similar encumbrances that do not
materially affect the value or use of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise

materially impair business operations at such properties and (iv) such imperfections or irregularities of title or Liens as do not
materially affect the value or use of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business
operations at such properties (collectively, “Permitted Encumbrances”), and (b) is the lessee of all leasehold estates reflected in the
latest audited financial statements included in such Company SEC Reports or acquired after the date thereof (except for leases that

and is in possession of the properties purported to be leased thereunder, and each such lease is valid without default thereunder by the
lessee or, to Company’s knowledge, the lessor. There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened condemnation
proceedings against the Company Real Property. Each lease pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as lessee, leases
any Company Leased Property is valid and in full force and effect and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the
Company’s knowledge, any other party to any such lease, is in default or in violation of any material provisions of any such lease. To
the knowledge of the Company, none of the buildings, structures or other improvements located on any Company Real Property
encroaches upon or over any adjoining parcel or real estate or any easement or right-of-way.

3.21 Fairness Opinion. The Board of Directors of the Company has received the opinion (which, if initially rendered verbally,
has been or will be confirmed by a written opinion, dated the same date) of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. to the effect that, as of the
date of such opinion and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio (as set forth in
Section 1.5(a)(iii)) in the First-Step Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock. Such
opinion has not been amended or rescinded in any material respect as of the date of this Agreement.

3.22 Fees. Other than for financial advisory services performed for the Company by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., pursuant to a
letter agreement, a true and complete copy of which has previously been provided to Parent, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents, has employed any broker or finder or incurred any
liability for any financial advisory fees, brokerage fees, commissions or finder’s fees, and no broker or finder has acted directly or
indirectly for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

3.23 Environmental Matters. Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance, and have complied, with any federal, state or
local Law relating to: (i) the protection or restoration of the environment or natural resources, (ii) the handling, storage, use, presence,
disposal, release or threatened release of, or exposure to, any hazardous substance, or (iii) noise, odor, wetlands, indoor air, pollution,
contamination or any injury to persons or property from exposure to any hazardous substance (collectively, “Environmental Laws”).
There are no legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions, or investigations of any nature pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, before any court, governmental agency or board or other forum against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries seeking to impose, or that could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition, on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of any liability or obligation arising under any Environmental Law and, to the knowledge of the Company, there is no
reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or investigation. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
any written notice, demand letter, executive or administrative order, directive or request for information from any Governmental Entity
or any third party indicating that it may be in violation of, or liable under, any Environmental Law.

3.24 Loan Matters.

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any written or oral (i) loan, loan agreement, note or
borrowing arrangement (including leases, credit enhancements, commitments, guarantees and interest-bearing assets) (collectively,

the Company’s auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to Parent. To the knowledge of the
Company, there is no reason to believe that the Company’s outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer

of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(c) Since January 1, 2014, (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any
director, officer, auditor, accountant or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or
obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of the Company,
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss
reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and accruals) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of
fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of the Company, to any director or officer of the Company.

and procedures to protect, safeguard and maintain the confidentiality, integrity and security of (i) their information technology systems

information, financial information, and credit card data (as such information or terms are defined and/or regulated under applicable
Laws, policies, agreements, and guidelines of any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency) (the “Company Data”), against any
unauthorized or improper use, access, transmittal, interruption, modification or corruption, except where the failure to have in place
such policies and procedures has not had and would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with applicable federal and state
confidentiality and data security Laws, policies, agreements, and guidelines of any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency
including, without limitation, Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the
provisions of the information security program adopted by the Company pursuant to 12 C.F.R. Part 364, and all industry standards
applicable to the Company Data, including card association rules and the payment card industry data security standards, except where
such failure to be in compliance has not had and would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as has not had and would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, there currently are not any, and since January 1, 2014, have not been any,
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, claims or written complaints with respect to unauthorized access to or
breaches of the security of (i) any of the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ information technology systems or (ii) Company Data or any
other such information collected, maintained or stored by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries (or any unlawful
acquisition, use, loss, destruction, compromise or disclosure thereof).

3.33 Tax Treatment of the Integrated Mergers. The Company has not taken any action, and has no knowledge of any fact or
circumstance relating to it, that would prevent the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from qualifying as a reorganization

predictive or forward-looking in nature) and (ii) as disclosed in disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the Company prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the “Parent Disclosure Schedule”) (which schedule sets forth, among other things, facts, circumstances
and events the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a
provision hereof or as an exception to one or more of the representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, or to one or more
of Parent’s covenants contained in Articles V or VI (and making specific reference to the Section of this Agreement to which they
relate); provided, that (x) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would
not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (y) the mere inclusion of an item in the Parent
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by Parent that such item
represents a material exception or fact, circumstance or event or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect and (z) disclosure in any paragraph of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall apply only to the indicated Section of this
Agreement except to the extent that it is reasonably clear on the face of such disclosure that it is relevant to another paragraph of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule or another Section of this Agreement), Parent and Merger Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant
to the Company as follows:

be treated as a financial holding company under the BHC Act. Parent has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and to conduct the business currently being conducted by it. Parent is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by
it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
Parent engages only in activities (and holds properties only of the types) permitted to bank holding companies by the BHC Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Merger Sub was formed solely for the
purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and since the date of its formation has not engaged in any
activates or conducted its operations other than in connection with or as contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) The outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary have been validly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid

duly authorized by all necessary corporate actions on the part of Parent’s Board of Directors. The Board of Directors of Parent has

its stockholders and has directed that the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the First-Step Merger be

Meeting to approve the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the First-Step Merger (the “Requisite Parent
Vote”), no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exceptions. The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the First-Step Merger have been validly authorized
(subject to the attainment of the Requisite Parent Vote), when issued, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and no
current or past stockholder of Parent will have any preemptive right or similar rights in respect thereof.

(b) Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors and
sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and no other proceedings on the part of Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Merger Sub and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Merger Sub and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Merger Sub, enforceable
against Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

4.5 No Violations. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, (i) assuming that the consents, approvals and filings
referred to in Section 4.6 have been obtained and the applicable waiting periods have expired, violate any Law to which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective properties) is subject, (ii) violate the Articles of Incorporation or bylaws of Parent or
Merger Sub or (iii) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under (or an event which, with due notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default under), or result in the termination of, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
note, bond, indenture, deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement, instrument or obligation to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, or to which any of their respective properties or assets may be subject, except (in the case of clause (iii) above)
for such breaches, violations, terminations, accelerations or creations which, either individually or in the aggregate, would not

or the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the Integrated Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Bank Merger. As of the date hereof, Parent has no knowledge of any reason pertaining to Parent why any of the approvals
referred to in this Section 4.6 should not be obtained without the imposition of any condition or requirement described in Section
7.1(c).

4.7 Governmental Filings. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has timely filed all reports, schedules, registration statements and
other documents that it has been required to file since January 1, 2014 with the Regulatory Agencies and have paid all fees and
assessments due and payable in connection therewith. As of their respective dates, each of such filings complied in all material respects
with all laws or regulations under which it was filed (or was amended so as to be in compliance promptly following discovery of such
noncompliance).

4.8 Securities Filings. Parent has timely filed with or furnished to the SEC all reports, schedules, registration statements,
definitive proxy statements and other documents that it has been required to file under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act since
January 1, 2014 (collectively, “Parent SEC Reports”). An accurate and complete copy of each of the Parent SEC Reports is publicly
available. No such Parent Report, at the time filed or furnished (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the
dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively) contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. As of their respective dates, all of the Parent SEC Reports complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations
of the SEC promulgated thereunder. No executive officer of Parent has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him
or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding comments from
or material unresolved issues raised by the SEC with respect to any of the Parent SEC Reports.

4.9 Financial Statements. The financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or incorporated by reference) in the
Parent SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable) (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books
and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows,
changes in stockholders’ equity and consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as
of the respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited statements to year-end audit adjustments normal in nature and
amount), (iii) complied, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iv) have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the notes
thereto. The books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP and any other legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. Since January 1, 2014, no
independent public accounting firm has resigned (or informed Parent that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public
accountants of Parent as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with Parent on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

4.10 Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any debt, liability or obligation of any nature
whatsoever (whether accrued, contingent, absolute or otherwise and whether due or to become due) other than liabilities reflected on or
reserved against in the consolidated balance sheet of Parent as of March 31, 2017 included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the quarter ended March 31, 2017, except for (i) liabilities incurred since March 31, 2017 in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice that, either alone or when combined with all similar liabilities, have not had, and would not reasonably be expected
to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent and (ii) liabilities incurred for legal, accounting, financial advising fees and out-of-pocket
expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

4.11 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since December 31, 2016, Parent and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses only in the ordinary and usual course of such businesses consistent with

their past practices and there has not been any event or occurrence that has had, or is reasonably expected to have, a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.

4.12 Legal Proceedings. Except as would not reasonably be likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to Parent’s
knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations
of any nature against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their current or former directors or executive officers acting in their
capacity as such.

4.13 Absence of Regulatory Actions. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order

civil money penalty by, or has been since January 1, 2014, a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2014, has
adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at the request or suggestion of any Governmental Entity, specific to Parent or its
Subsidiaries, that, in each of any such cases, currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its business or that in any material
manner relates to its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or its business
(each, whether or not set forth in the Parent Disclosure Schedule, a “Parent Regulatory Agreement”), nor has Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries been advised in writing or, to Parent’s knowledge, orally, since January 1, 2014, by any Governmental Entity that it is
considering issuing, initiating, ordering, or requesting any such Parent Regulatory Agreement. Except for examinations of Parent and
its Subsidiaries conducted by a Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of business and pursuant to Parent Regulatory Agreements,
no Regulatory Agency has initiated or has pending any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Parent, investigation into the business or
operations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 2014. There is no claim, action, suit, proceeding, investigation or notice
of violation (whether civil, criminal or administrative) pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against any officer or director
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the performance of his or her duties as an officer or director of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries.

4.14 Compliance with Laws.

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries hold, and have at all times since January 1, 2014 held, all licenses, franchises, permits
and authorizations necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their respective properties, rights
and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), and, to the
knowledge of Parent, no suspension or cancellation of any such necessary license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened.
Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have since January 1, 2014 complied in all material respects with and are not in material default or

(b) Sandy Spring Bank has received a rating of “Satisfactory” or better in its most recent examination or interim review with
respect to the CRA. Parent does not have knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would cause Sandy Spring Bank or any other
Subsidiary of Parent to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the CRA, and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating for CRA purposes by federal bank regulators of lower than “Satisfactory”. To the
knowledge of Parent, since January 1, 2014, no non-public customer information has been disclosed to or accessed by an unauthorized
third party in a manner which would cause either Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake any remedial action. The Board of
Directors of Sandy Spring Bank (or where appropriate of any other Subsidiary of Parent) has adopted, and Sandy Spring Bank (or such
other Subsidiary of Parent) has implemented, an anti-money laundering program that contains adequate and appropriate customer
identification verification procedures that comply with Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and such anti-money laundering
program meets the requirements in all material respects of Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder, and
Sandy Spring Bank (or such other Subsidiary of Parent) has complied in all material respects with any requirements to file reports and
other necessary documents as required by the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder.

4.15 Taxes.

(a) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has duly and timely filed (taking into account all applicable extensions) all Tax
Returns in all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete
in all material respects. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any
material Tax Return. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable
to any material Tax that remains in effect.

(b) All Taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Returns) that are due have been fully and
timely paid or adequate reserves therefor have been made on the financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries included (or
incorporated by reference) in the Parent SEC Reports (including the related notes, where applicable).

(c) The federal income Tax Returns of Parent and its Subsidiaries for all years up to and including 2013 have been examined
by the IRS or are Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable period for assessment under applicable law, after giving effect to
extensions or waivers, has expired. No deficiency with respect to a material amount of Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no pending or threatened in writing disputes, claims, audits, examinations,
investigations or other proceedings regarding any material Tax of Parent and its Subsidiaries or the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries
for which adequate reserves have not been established. No claim has been made in writing by any Governmental Entity in a
jurisdiction where Parent or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that Parent or such Subsidiary is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction.

(d) Parent has made available to the Company true, correct, and complete copies of any private letter ruling requests, closing
agreements or gain recognition agreements with respect to Taxes requested or executed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) There are no Liens for material Taxes (except Taxes not yet due and payable) on any of the assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(f) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification
agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among Parent and its Subsidiaries).
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return
(other than a group the common parent of which was Parent) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any person (other than Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries)

(c) There is no pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened litigation, administrative action or proceeding relating to
any Parent Employee Plan. All of Parent Employee Plans comply in all material respects with all applicable requirements of ERISA,
the IRC and other applicable laws. There has occurred no “prohibited transaction” (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the IRC) with respect to Parent Employee Plans that is likely to result in the imposition of any penalties or Taxes upon
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the IRC.

(d) Neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability under Title IV of
ERISA that has not been satisfied in full, and Parent is not aware of any condition that exists that would, or would be reasonably likely
to, result in Parent incurring any such liability.

(e) No Parent Employee Plan or employee plans maintained by any Parent ERISA Affiliate has experienced any “reportable
events,” as such term is defined under ERISA Section 4043, for which a waiver has not been granted, has had any “accumulated
funding deficiencies,” as such term is defined under ERISA Section 302(a)(2) (prior to amendment by P.L. 109-280) or IRC Sections
412(a) or 4971 (whether or not waived), nor for years after amendment by P.L. 109-280 any “funding shortfalls” as defined in IRC
Section 430(c).

(f) Each Parent Employee Plan that is an “employee pension benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and which
is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC (a “Parent Qualified Plan”) has received a favorable determination letter
or a prototype plan or volume submitter plan advisory opinion letter from the IRS for the most recent applicable remedial amendment
cycle, and, to the knowledge of Parent, there are no circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such letter. No Parent Qualified
Plan is an “employee stock ownership plan” (as defined in Section 4975(e)(7) of the IRC).

Employee Plan, for any period through the date hereof have been timely made or paid in full, or to the extent not required to be made
or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected in the financial statements of Parent. Each Parent Employee Plan that is
an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either (A) is funded through an insurance company contract and is not a
“welfare benefit fund” within the meaning of Section 419 of the IRC or (B) is unfunded.

(i) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause or accelerate the vesting, exercisability or delivery of, increase in
the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit or result in any forgiveness of indebtedness to, any employee, officer,
director or individual independent contractor of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any funding of or limitation on the right of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Parent Employee Plan or related
trust.

4.17 Fairness Opinion. The Board of Directors of Parent has received the opinion (which, if initially rendered verbally, has been
or will be confirmed by a written opinion, dated the same date) of Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. to the effect that, as of the date of
such opinion and subject to the assumptions and qualifications set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio in the First-Step Merger is fair,
from a financial point of view, to Parent. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded in any material respect as of the date of this
Agreement.

4.18 Fees. Other than for financial advisory services performed for Parent by The Kafafian Group, Inc. and Sandler O’Neill &
Partners, L.P., pursuant to letter agreements, true and complete copies of which have previously been provided to the Company, neither

finder or incurred any liability for any financial advisory fees, brokerage fees, commissions or finder’s fees, and no broker or finder has
acted directly or indirectly for Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

4.19 Loan Matters.

(a) Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent, each Loan of Parent and its Subsidiaries (i) is evidenced by notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness that are true,
genuine and what they purport to be, (ii) to the extent carried on the books and records of Parent and its Subsidiaries as secured Loans,
has been secured by valid charges, mortgages, pledges, security interests, restrictions, claims, Liens or encumbrances, as applicable,
which have been perfected and (iii) is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance

investors) and with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and rules.

of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the MGCL.

4.21 Insurance. Parent and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts as the
management of Parent reasonably has determined to be prudent and consistent with industry practice, and Parent and its Subsidiaries
are in compliance in all material respects with their insurance policies and are not in default under any such policy. Each such policy is
outstanding and in full force and effect and, except for policies insuring against potential liabilities of officers, directors and employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries, Parent or the relevant Subsidiary thereof is the sole beneficiary of such policies, and all premiums and
other payments due under any such policy have been paid, and all claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion.

4.22 Corporate Documents and Records. Parent has previously provided a complete and correct copy of the Articles of
Incorporation, bylaws and similar organizational documents of Parent and each of Parent’s Subsidiaries, as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement. Neither Parent nor any of Parent’s Subsidiaries is in violation of its Articles of Incorporation, bylaws or similar
organizational documents. The minute books of Parent and each of Parent’s Subsidiaries constitute a complete and correct record of all
actions taken by their respective boards of directors (and each committee thereof) and their stockholders.

4.23 Parent Information. The information regarding Parent and its Subsidiaries to be supplied by Parent for inclusion in the
Form S-4, any filings or approvals under applicable state securities laws, or any filing pursuant to Rule 165 or Rule 425 under the
Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement (except for such portions thereof that relate only to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder. The information supplied, or to be supplied, by Parent for inclusion in

applications to Governmental Entities to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be accurate in all material respects.

4.24 Internal Controls.

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP and to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s
general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets, and (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management’s general or specific authorization.

(b) Parent (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to Parent, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of Parent by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
and (y) has identified and disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to Parent’s outside auditors and the
audit committee of Parent’s Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect Parent’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent’s internal controls over financial reporting. These
disclosures were made in writing by management to Parent’s auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made
available to Parent. To the knowledge of Parent, there is no reason to believe that Parent’s outside auditors and its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(c) Since January 1, 2014, (i) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director, officer,
auditor, accountant or representative of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or, to the knowledge of Parent, oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and
(ii) no attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has
reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Parent or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of Parent or any committee thereof or to the knowledge of Parent, to any
director or officer of Parent.

4.25 Data Privacy. Parent and its Subsidiaries have in place commercially reasonable data protection and privacy policies and
procedures to protect, safeguard and maintain the confidentiality, integrity and security of (i) their information technology systems and
(ii) all information, data and transactions stored or contained therein or transmitted thereby, including personally identifiable
information, financial information, and credit card data (as such information or terms are defined and/or regulated under applicable
Laws, policies, agreements, and guidelines of any Governmental Entity or Regulatory Agency) (the “Parent Data”), against any
unauthorized or improper use, access, transmittal, interruption, modification or corruption, except where the failure to have in place
such policies and procedures has not had and would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with

industry standards applicable to the Parent Data, including card association rules and the payment card industry data security standards,
except where such failure to be in compliance has not had and would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Except as has not had and would not, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, there currently are not any, and since January 1, 2014, have not
been any, pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, claims or written complaints with respect to unauthorized access to or
breaches of the security of (i) any of Parent’s or its Subsidiaries’ information technology systems or (ii) Parent Data or any other such
information collected, maintained or stored by or on behalf of Parent and its Subsidiaries (or any unlawful acquisition, use, loss,
destruction, compromise or disclosure thereof).

4.26 Tax Treatment of the Integrated Mergers. Parent has not taken any action, and has no knowledge of any fact or
circumstance relating to it, that would prevent the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from qualifying as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the IRC.

(e) amend, repeal or modify any provision of its Articles of Incorporation or bylaws in a manner which would adversely
affect any Company stockholder or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

ARTICLE VI
COVENANTS

6.1 Acquisition Proposals.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or its
Subsidiaries’ officers, directors or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative
(collectively, “Representatives”) retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
encourage, or take any other action to facilitate, any inquiries, discussions or the making of any proposal that constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any information or data regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any person in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry or indication of interest that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations, or otherwise communicate in any way with any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or Representatives of Parent or
Merger Sub), regarding an Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 6.1 by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the date of the Company Meeting, in the event the Company
receives an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.1(a), it may, and may
permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries’ Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data
and participate in such negotiations or discussions to the extent that its Board of Directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the
advice of its outside legal counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) that (1) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (2) failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to result
in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that, prior to furnishing any nonpublic information permitted to be
provided by the prior sentence, the Company shall have provided such information to Parent and shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no more favorable to such person than the Confidentiality Agreement, which
confidentiality agreement shall not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company.

(b) As used in this Agreement,

(i) “Acquisition Proposal” shall mean any proposal or offer with respect to, or third party indication of interest in,
any of the following (other than the transactions contemplated hereunder): (1) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, or other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (2) any acquisition or purchase, direct or
indirect, of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the Company’s consolidated assets or twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any class
of equity securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent
(25%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company in a single transaction or series of transactions; (3) any tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more of any
class of equity or voting securities of the Company; and

(ii) “Superior Proposal” shall mean any bona fide written offer or proposal made by a third party to consummate an
Acquisition Proposal that the Company’s Board of Directors determines in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel
and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors) (1) would, if consummated, result in the acquisition of all, but not less than
all, of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company;
(2) would result in a

transaction that (A) involves consideration to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock that is more favorable, from a
financial point of view, than the consideration to be paid to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to this Agreement, considering,
among other things, the nature of the consideration being offered and any material regulatory approvals or other risks associated with
the timing of the proposed transaction beyond, or in addition to, those specifically contemplated hereby, and which proposal is not
conditioned upon obtaining financing and (B) is, in light of the other terms of such proposal, more favorable to the stockholders of the
Company than the Integrated Mergers and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (3) is reasonably likely to be
completed on the terms proposed, in each case, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition
Proposal.

(c) The Company will promptly notify (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) Parent of receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal and the substance
thereof, including, in each case, the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and the material terms and
conditions thereof, and shall provide to Parent any written materials received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
therewith. The Company will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent of any developments,
discussions or negotiations with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, including any amendments to or revisions of the
terms of such Acquisition Proposal or inquiry.

(d) The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any parties conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not release any
third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality agreements or standstill agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party and shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any existing confidentiality or standstill agreements to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance with the terms thereof. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and cause its and their officers, directors, agents,
advisors and representatives not to on its behalf, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

6.2 Advice of Changes. Prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly advise the other party orally and in writing to the extent
that it has knowledge of (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in
any material respect or (ii) the failure by it to comply in any material respect with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under
this Agreement.

6.3 Access to Information.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford the other party such reasonable
access during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to the books, records (including, without
limitation Tax Returns), contracts, properties, personnel and to such other information relating to itself and its Subsidiaries as the other
party may reasonably request; provided, however, that no investigation pursuant to this Section 6.3 shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made by any party in this Agreement. No party shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the entity in possession or control of such information or contravene any Law, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or
binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties will make appropriate and reasonable substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

(b) All information and documents obtained pursuant to this Section 6.3 be held in confidence to the extent required by, and
in accordance with, the provisions of confidentiality set forth in a letter agreement, dated January 15, 2017 between Parent and the
Company (the “Confidentiality Agreement”).

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive
the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give either party, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the other party prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each
party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its
Subsidiaries’ respective operations.

(d) From and after the date hereof, Representatives of Parent and the Company shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and
plan for the conversion of the Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ data processing and related electronic informational systems to those
used by Parent and its Subsidiaries with the goal of conducting such conversion as soon as reasonably practicable following the
consummation of the Bank Merger.

6.4 Applications; Consents.

(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and shall use their reasonable best efforts to prepare and file as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof all necessary applications, notices and filings to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including, without limitation, the Integrated Mergers and the Bank Merger). The Company and Parent shall furnish each
other with all information concerning themselves, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective Subsidiaries’ directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with any application, notice or filing
made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other on, all the information relating to Parent and the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity pursuant
to this Section 6.4(a). In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as reasonably
practicable. Each party will provide the other with copies of any applications and all correspondence relating thereto prior to filing,
other than any portions of material filed in connection therewith that contain competitively sensitive business or other proprietary
information filed under a claim of confidentiality. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the
obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Each party shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or
conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, shall give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, each of the parties hereto shall, and they shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consent, authorization or approval of any third party that is
required to be obtained in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 Antitakeover Provisions. None of the Company, Parent or their respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that
would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Integrated Mergers, or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Integrated Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated hereby

from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable
to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent and the Company and the members of their respective Boards of Directors will
grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.6 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as reasonably possible, including using efforts to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, extensions, waivers,
consents and approvals from all applicable Governmental Entities, effecting all necessary registrations, applications and filings
(including, without limitation, filings under any applicable state securities laws) and obtaining any required contractual consents and
regulatory approvals.

6.7 Publicity. Parent and the Company shall each use their reasonable best efforts (a) to develop a joint communications plan,
and (b) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
consistent with such joint communications plan. Except in respect of any announcement required by (i) applicable Law, (ii) a request
by a Governmental Entity or (iii) an obligation pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities exchange, Parent and
the Company agree to consult with each other and to obtain the advance approval of the other party (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before issuing any press release or, to the extent practical, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company agrees that neither it nor any
Subsidiary shall issue any communication of a general nature regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to employees
(including general communications relating to benefits and compensation) without prior consultation with Parent and, to the extent
relating to post-Closing employment, benefit or compensation information, without the prior consent of Parent or issue any
communication of a general nature to customers without the prior approval of Parent.

6.8 Stockholder Meetings.

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the “Parent
Meeting” and the “Company Meeting,” respectively) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote and the Requisite Parent Vote required in connection with this
Agreement and the First-Step Merger and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type customarily brought before
an annual or special meeting of stockholders to approve a merger agreement or otherwise approve the transactions contemplated
hereby, and each shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such meetings to occur as soon as reasonably practicable and on the same
date. The Board of Directors of each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the stockholders of
Parent and the Company, as the case may be, the Requisite Parent Vote, in the case of Parent, and the Requisite Company Vote, in the
case of the Company, including by communicating to its respective stockholders its recommendation (and including such
recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they approve (i) this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in the
case of the Company and (ii) the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the First-Step Merger, in the case of
Parent.

(b) Subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of Parent, after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would be reasonably likely to result
in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend approval of the issuance of shares of Parent
Common Stock in connection with the First-Step Merger, then in submitting such issuance of shares to its stockholders, the Board of
Directors of Parent may (but

shall not be required to) submit the share issuance to Parent’s stockholders without recommendation (although the resolutions
approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of Directors of Parent may
communicate the basis for its lack of a recommendation to Parent’s stockholders in the Joint Proxy Statement or an appropriate
amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by Law.

(c) Subject to Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, if the Board of Directors of the Company, after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would be reasonably likely to result
in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend this Agreement, then the Board of Directors of the
Company may fail to make such recommendation, or withdraw, modify or change any such recommendation (although the resolutions
approving this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended); provided, that the Board of Directors of the
Company may not take any actions under this sentence unless (i) it gives Parent at least three (3) business days’ prior written notice of
its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take such
action (including, in the event such action is taken by the Board of Directors of the Company in response to an Acquisition Proposal,
the latest material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the third party making, any such Acquisition Proposal, or any
amendment or modification thereof, or describe in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at the end of such
notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company takes into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed
by Parent (it being understood that Parent shall not have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement) and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters,
its financial advisors, determines in good faith that it would nevertheless be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law to continue to recommend this Agreement. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be
deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.8(c) and will require a new notice period as referred to in this
Section 6.8(c).

(d) Parent or the Company shall adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting or the Company Meeting, as the case may be, if, as
of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock, as the case may be, represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the Company or Parent, as applicable, has not received proxies representing a sufficient
number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote or the Requisite Parent Vote.

6.9 Registration of Parent Common Stock.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, Parent and the Company shall prepare and file the Joint
Proxy Statement with the SEC and Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy
Statement will be included as a prospectus. The Company will furnish to Parent the information required to be included in the Form S-
4 with respect to the Company’s business and affairs and shall have the right to review and consult with Parent and approve the form
of, and any characterizations of such information included in, the Form S-4 prior to its, or any amendment or supplement thereto, being
filed with the SEC. Parent and the Company shall each use their reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective by the
SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the First-Step Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company and Parent will cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to their respective stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after
it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the First-Step Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, any
comments on or correspondence related to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 from the SEC, or any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent

Company, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
party hereto and, to the extent required by Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed by Parent with the SEC and disseminated by the Company and Parent to their respective stockholders.

(b) Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the
First-Step Merger and each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of Company
Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall notify The Nasdaq Stock Market of the additional shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued by Parent in exchange for the shares of Company Common Stock.

6.10 Notification of Certain Matters. Each party shall give prompt notice to the other of: (i) any event or notice of, or other
communication relating to, a default or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default, received by it or any of
its Subsidiaries subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, under any contract material to the financial
condition, properties, businesses or results of operations of each party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to which each party or any
Subsidiary is a party or is subject; and (ii) any event, condition, change or occurrence which individually or in the aggregate has, or
which, so far as reasonably can be foreseen at the time of its occurrence, is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other party of any notice or other communication from any third party
alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

6.11 Employee Benefit Matters.

(a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain or cause to be maintained employee benefit plans and compensation
opportunities for the benefit of all persons who are employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time and whose employment is not specifically terminated at or prior to the Effective Time (a “Continuing Employee”) that, in the
aggregate are substantially comparable to the employee benefit and compensation opportunities that are generally made available to
similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries; provided, however, in no event shall any Continuing Employee be eligible to
participate in any closed or frozen plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt resolutions providing that the Company’s health and welfare plans
as set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule will be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time (or such later
date as requested by Parent or as may be required to comply with any applicable advance notice or other requirements contained in
such plans) and shall arrange for termination of all corresponding insurance policies, service agreements and related arrangements
effective on the same date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their dependents shall
terminate under any of the Company’s health and welfare plans prior to the time such Continuing Employees or their dependents, as
applicable, become eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries and their dependents and, consequently, no Continuing Employee shall experience a gap in coverage. Continuing
Employees who become covered under health plans, programs and benefits of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall receive credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid under the Company’s health plan for the plan year in which coverage commences under Parent’s
health plan. Terminated Company employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued coverage under group health
plans of Parent in accordance with the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act.

Table of Contents

(c) For purposes of vesting and determination of eligibility to participate under Parent’s compensation and benefit plans,
programs or policies (other than any plan that is frozen as to participation), each Continuing Employee who is eligible to participate in
such plans, programs or policies shall receive credit for service with the Company; provided, however, for the avoidance of any doubt,
that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent (x) that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service or (y) prohibited under Parent’s compensation and benefit plans, programs or policies. Continuing Employees shall
not receive prior service credit for benefit accrual purposes under any of Parent’s compensation and benefit plans, programs or policies,
except for Parent’s paid time off program.

(d) The Company shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to terminate the Company’s 401(k) plan effective as of the
day immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. Upon termination of the 401(k) plan
all participants will be 100% vested in their account balances. If requested in writing by Parent, the Company will also take all
necessary steps to file or cause to be filed all necessary documents with the IRS for a determination letter for termination of the
Company’s 401(k) plan. The Company shall, or shall direct the fiduciaries of the Company’s 401(k) plan to (to the extent permitted by
law), provide Parent and its counsel with a draft of each resolution, amendment, participant communication or other document relating
to the termination of the Company’s 401(k) plan at least five (5) business days before such document is adopted, distributed or filed,
and no such document shall be adopted, distributed or filed without Parent’s approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Parent shall take any and all actions as may be required to permit the Continuing Employees to roll over their
account balances (excluding loans) in the Company’s 401(k) plan into Parent’s 401(k) plan.

(e) Parent agrees that each full time Company employee who is involuntarily terminated by Parent (other than for cause as
determined by Parent) within twelve (12) months of the Effective Time and who is not covered by a separate severance, change in
control, or employment agreement shall, upon executing an appropriate release in the form reasonably determined by Parent, receive a
severance payment equal to two weeks of base pay (at the rate in effect on the termination date) for each year of service at the
Company, with a minimum payment equal to four (4) weeks of base pay for Company employees who have one (1) full year or less of
service as of their date of termination and a maximum equal to twenty-six (26) weeks of base pay. For purposes of calculating the
number of years of service, fractional years of service shall be rounded up or down to the nearest full year, except for purposes of
determining eligibility to receive a severance payment. For purposes of calculating base pay, Company employees who are paid on an
hourly basis shall be deemed to have a base pay equal to the employee’s average weekly compensation over the two months prior to the
termination date. For employees whose compensation is determined in whole or in part on the basis of commission income, “base pay”
shall include base salary or total hourly wages paid plus commissions earned during the most recent twelve (12) months ended as of the
date of termination of employment. Any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who has or is a party to any employment
agreement, severance agreement, change in control agreement or any other agreement or arrangement that provides for any payment
that may be triggered by the First-Step Merger or the Bank Merger shall not receive the severance benefits as provided in this
Section 6.11(e) but will receive the payment specified in such agreement.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director, independent contractor or consultant of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, the
Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan or any other benefit or employment plan,
program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the first sentence of Section 9.11,

implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person, including without limitation any current or former employee, officer, director,
independent contractor or consultant (or any spouse or dependent of such individual) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

(g) Effective as of, and contingent upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor in accordance
with their terms all employment, severance, change in control and other compensation agreements and arrangements between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their employees, which are not terminated in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and all accrued and vested benefit obligations through the Effective Time which are
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their current or former directors, officers, employees or consultants.

6.12 Indemnification.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the current or former directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an “Indemnified Party”), and any person who becomes an
Indemnified Party between the date hereof and the Effective Time, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees
and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out
of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer
or employee of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or was prior to the Effective Time serving
at the request of any such party as a director, officer, employee, trustee or partner of another corporation, partnership, trust, joint
venture, employee benefit plan or other entity or (ii) any matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to the fullest extent such person would have been indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses pursuant to the
Company’s Articles of Incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement and as permitted by applicable Law, and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
provided that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides a signed written undertaking to repay such advances if the person is
not entitled to mandatory indemnification and it is ultimately determined that such person has not met the relevant standard of conduct.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section 6.12(a), upon learning of any action, suit,
proceeding or investigation described above, shall promptly notify Parent thereof. Any failure to so notify shall not affect the
obligations of Parent under Section 6.12(a) unless and to the extent that Parent is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the Company’s current
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance covering each person currently covered by the Company’s directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policy with respect to claims against such persons arising from facts or events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in no event shall Parent be required to expend annually pursuant to this Section 6.12(c) more than three
hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the “Premium Cap”) and, if
Parent is unable to maintain such policy as a result of this proviso, Parent shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available by
payment of such amount; provided further, that Parent may (i) request the Company to obtain an extended reporting period
endorsement under the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy or (ii) substitute therefor “tail” policies the
material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such persons than the
Company’s existing insurance policies as of the date hereof if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the
aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.

Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such

portion thereof, then such non-paying party shall pay the costs and expenses of the other party (including reasonable attorneys’ fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit. The amounts payable pursuant to Sections 8.2(a), (b) and (c) constitute liquidated damages

9.9 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the documents and instruments referred to herein, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, represents the entire understanding of the parties hereto with reference to the transactions contemplated
hereby and supersedes any and all other oral or written agreements heretofore made.

9.10 Successors and Assigns; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that this Agreement may not be assigned by either party hereto without

9.11 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 6.12, which is intended to benefit each
Indemnified Party and his or her heir and representatives, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein)
is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the
right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or liability to any other person. In some
instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated

security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or

Exhibit A

PLAN OF MERGER
Merging

TOUCHDOWN ACQUISITION, INC.,
a Virginia corporation,

with and into
WASHINGTONFIRST BANKSHARES INC.,

a Virginia corporation
1.    The Merger. Touchdown Acquisition, Inc., a Virginia corporation (the “Merged Corporation”) and wholly owned

subsidiary of Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation (“Parent”), shall, at the Effective Time (as defined below), be
merged (the “Merger”) with and into WashingtonFirst Bankshares Inc., a Virginia corporation (the “Company”). The parties shall file
Articles of Merger (the “Articles of Merger”) meeting the requirements of Section 13.1-720 of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act
(the “VSCA”) with the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

2.    Effective Time; Effects of the Merger.

(a)    The Merger shall become effective at the date and time (the “Effective Time”) specified in the Articles of Merger.

(b)    The Company shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the “Surviving
Corporation”) in the Merger and shall continue its existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Upon consummation of
the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Merged Corporation shall terminate.

(c)    The Merger will have the effects set forth in Section 13.1-721 of the VSCA. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, the Company shall possess all of the properties, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Merged Corporation and be subject to all of the debts, liabilities and obligations of the Merged
Corporation.

3.    Articles of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as the Surviving
Corporation, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Merged Corporation, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and
attached hereto as Exhibit 1, until such Articles of Incorporation are thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and applicable
law.

4.    Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Company, as the Surviving Corporation, shall be the Bylaws of the Merged
Corporation, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and
applicable law.

5.    Manner and Basis of Converting Shares of Merged Corporation Common Stock and Company Common Stock. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, the Merged Corporation or any
holder of any shares of the common stock or other capital stock of the Company, Parent or the Merged Corporation:

(a)    Merged Corporation Common Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of the common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Merged Corporation issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
become one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of the common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b)    Conversion of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of the common stock, par value
 

Exhibit A – 1

Table of Contents

$0.01 per share, of the Company (“Company Voting Common Stock”) and each share of the Non-Voting Common Stock, Series A of
the Company (“Company Non-Voting Common Stock,” and, together with the Company Voting Common Stock, the “Company
Common Stock”) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time, other than (i) Dissenting Shares (as defined below) and (ii) shares of
Company Common Stock owned or held, other than in a bona fide fiduciary or agency capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously
contracted, by Parent, the Company or a Subsidiary of either (collectively “Excluded Shares”), shall become and be converted into a
number of shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Parent (“Parent Common Stock”) as
follows:

(i)    if the Parent Average Price is greater than $53.23, the Exchange Ratio shall equal .8210;

(ii)    if the Parent Average Price is greater than $50.15 and equal to or less than $53.23, the Exchange Ratio shall
equal the quotient of $43.70 divided by the Parent Average Price;

(iii)    if the Parent Average Price is equal to or greater than $37.07 and equal to or less than $50.15, the Exchange
Ratio shall equal .8713;

(iv)    if the Parent Average Price is equal to or greater than $34.00 and less than $37.07, the Exchange Ratio shall be
equal to the quotient of $32.30 divided by the Parent Average Price; and

(v)    if the Parent Average Price is less than $34.00, the Exchange Ratio shall equal .9500.

“Parent Average Price” shall mean the volume-weighted average price per share, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a cent, of Parent
Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the fifth
business day immediately preceding the closing of the Merger, as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets, or any successor thereto,
through its “volume weighted average price” function (or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by
Parent and the Company). The Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger is sometimes referred to herein as the “Merger
Consideration.”

(c)    Parent Capital Stock. At and after the Effective Time, each share of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

(d)    No Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor will be
issued in the Merger; instead, Parent shall pay to each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying such fraction by
the Parent Average Price.

(e)    Anti-Dilutive Adjustments. If, between the date of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of May 15, 2017 (the
“Merger Agreement”) by and among Parent, the Merged Corporation and the Company and the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or into a different class by reason of any
stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares, the Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted appropriately to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by the Merger
Agreement prior to such event.

(f)     Excluded Shares. As of the Effective Time, each Excluded Share shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no exchange or payment shall be made with respect thereto.

6.    Treatment of Company Equity Awards

(a)    At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted by the Company under a
Company Stock Plan (as defined below) or assumed by the Company prior to the date of this
 

Exhibit A – 2

Table of Contents

Agreement, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company
Stock Option”) shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the
holder of such Company Stock Option to receive (without interest), no later than the first payroll period following the Effective Time
and in any event no later than thirty (30) calendar days following the closing date of the Merger, an amount in cash equal to the product
of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the Equity Award Cash-out Price (as defined below) over (B) the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock of such Company Stock Option less applicable taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock Option which has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
that is greater than or equal to the Equity Award Cash-out Price shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or
payment. For purposes of this Agreement, the term “Equity Award Cash-out Price” means an amount equal to the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio multiplied by (y) the Parent Average Price.

(b)    At the Effective Time, each award in respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or
other lapse restriction granted under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a “Company
Restricted Stock Award” and, together with the Company Stock Options, the “Company Equity Awards”) shall fully vest and shall
be converted into the right to receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 5(b) of this Plan of
Merger. Parent shall pay or issue the consideration described in this Section 6 within five (5) business days following the Effective
Time. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Company Restricted Stock Awards all such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
under the Internal Revenue Code or any provisions of state, local, or foreign tax law.

(c)    For purposes of this Plan of Merger, “Company Stock Plans” means the WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc. 2010
Equity Compensation Plan and the 1st Portfolio Holding Corporation 2009 Stock Incentive Plan.

7.    Exchange Procedures.

(a)    Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Exchange Agent”), for the benefit of the holders of certificates, or evidence of
shares in book entry form, representing Company Common Stock (“Old Certificates”), for exchange in accordance with this
Section 7, (a) certificates, or at Parent’s option, evidence of shares in book entry form, representing the Parent Common Stock (“New
Certificates”), to be given to the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 5(b) in exchange for outstanding shares of
such Company Common Stock, and (b) to the extent then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 5(d) (such New Certificates and cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund”). The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent, provided that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
amount of Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Old Certificates. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent, or as otherwise directed by Parent.

(b)    Company Stock Certificate Exchange Procedures.

(i)    As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) business days
thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 5, a letter of transmittal (a “Letter of Transmittal”) (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected,

and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration which such holder shall
have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject to, Section 5(b), and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant to Section 7(b)(iii). From and after the
Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such properly completed Letter of Transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing the Merger Consideration to which such
holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled to receive in accordance with, and subject to, Section 5(b), and (ii) a
check representing the amount of (1) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
surrendered Old Certificate or Old Certificates pursuant to Section 5(b) and (2) any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 7(b)(iii), and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Old Certificates or any
dividends payable under Section 7(b)(iii). Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 7(b), each Old Certificate shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section 7(b).

(ii)    The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the shares
of Parent Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other
distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account of the persons entitled thereto. If there is a transfer of
ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
shall be issued to the transferee thereof if the Old Certificates representing such Company Common Stock are presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required, in the reasonable judgment of Parent and the Exchange Agent, to evidence
and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

(iii)    No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common
Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement shall be remitted to any person entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock hereunder
until such person surrenders his or her Old Certificates in accordance with this Section 7(b). Subject to the effect of applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, upon the surrender of such person’s Old Certificates, such person shall be entitled to
receive any dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which subsequent to the Effective Time had become payable but
not paid with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such person’s Old Certificates.

(iv)    The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and from and
after the Effective Time there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer records of the Company of any shares of Company Common
Stock other than to settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Old Certificates are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 7(b).

(v)    Any portion of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid pursuant to Section 5(b), any dividends or other
distributions to be paid pursuant to this Section 7(b) or any proceeds from any investments thereof that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be repaid by the Exchange Agent to Parent upon the
written request of Parent. After such request is made, any stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
Section 7(b) shall look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such

stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement (or any affiliate thereof) shall be liable to any former holder of Company
Common Stock for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(vi)    Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the Company’s stock transfer books to establish
the identity of those persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the
event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock represented by any Old Certificate, Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved
with respect to any claims thereto.

8.    Appraisal Rights. In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the VSCA, no appraisal rights shall be available to the holders of
Company Voting Common Stock. Each share of Company Non-Voting Common Stock which is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and which is owned by a holder who (i) shall not have voted or caused or permitted any of his, her or its
shares to be voted in favor of the Merger, and (ii) pursuant to Section 13.1-729 et seq. of the VSCA, duly and validly exercises and
perfects his, her or its appraisal rights with respect to his, her or its shares of Company Non-Voting Common Stock (the “Dissenting
Shares”), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but, instead, the holder thereof, with respect to such
Dissenting Shares, shall be entitled to payment in cash from the Surviving Corporation of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of the VSCA. If any such holder shall have failed to duly and validly exercise or perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal rights, each share of Company Non-Voting Common Stock of such holder as to which
appraisal rights were not duly and validly exercised or perfected, or were effectively withdrawn or lost, shall not be deemed a
Dissenting Share and shall automatically be converted into and shall thereafter be exchangeable only for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Plan of Merger.

9.    Amendment. Prior to the Effective Time, any provision of this Plan of Merger may be amended or modified at any time by
an agreement in writing between the Company, the Merged Company and Parent (which writing shall expressly state the intent to
amend or modify this Plan of Merger) except that, after the vote by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment or modification
may be made that would reduce the amount or alter or change the kind of consideration to be received by holders of Company
Common Stock or that would contravene any provision of the VSCA or the applicable state and federal banking laws, rules and
regulations.

10.    Abandonment. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Merger may be abandoned, subject to the terms of the Merger
Agreement.

Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement), by virtue of the First-Step Merger, automatically and without any action on the part of
any holder of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of WashingtonFirst (“WashingtonFirst Voting Common Stock”) or
any holder of shares of non-voting common stock, Series A, of WashingtonFirst (“WashingtonFirst Non-Voting Common Stock” and,
together with WashingtonFirst Voting Common Stock, “WashingtonFirst Common Stock”), each share of WashingtonFirst Common
Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares (each as defined in the
Agreement)) shall become and be converted into 0.8713 of a share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Sandy Spring
(“Sandy Spring Common Stock”), subject to adjustment (as to which we express no opinion) if the Parent Average Price (as defined in
the Agreement) is less than $37.07 or greater than $50.15. The foregoing ratio of 0.8713 of a share of Sandy Spring Common stock for
one share of WashingtonFirst Common Stock is referred to herein as the “Exchange Ratio.” The terms and conditions of the
Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

The Agreement further provides that, simultaneously with or immediately following the Effective Time, WashingtonFirst Bank, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of WashingtonFirst, is expected to merge with and into Sandy Spring Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Sandy Spring, pursuant to a separate plan of bank merger (such transaction, the “Bank Merger”).

KBW has acted as financial advisor to WashingtonFirst and not as an advisor to or agent of any other person. As part of our
investment banking business, we are continually engaged in the valuation of bank and bank holding company securities in connection
with acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations
for various other purposes. As specialists in the securities of banking companies, we have experience in, and knowledge of, the
valuation of banking enterprises. In the ordinary course of our and their broker-dealer businesses, and in the case of

WashingtonFirst further to an existing sales and trading relationship with a KBW affiliate, we and our affiliates may from time to time
purchase securities from, and sell securities to, WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring. In addition, as a market maker in securities, we and
our affiliates may from time to time have a long or short position in, and buy or sell, debt or equity securities of WashingtonFirst or
Sandy Spring for our and their own accounts and for the accounts of our and their respective customers and clients. We have acted
exclusively for the board of directors of WashingtonFirst (the “Board”) in rendering this opinion and will receive a fee from
WashingtonFirst for our services. A portion of our fee is payable upon the rendering of this opinion, and a significant portion is
contingent upon the successful completion of the Transaction. In addition, WashingtonFirst has agreed to indemnify us for certain
liabilities arising out of our engagement.

In addition to this present engagement, in the past two years, KBW has provided investment banking and financial advisory
services to WashingtonFirst and received compensation for such services. KBW acted as an underwriter in connection with
WashingtonFirst’s December 2015 registered offering of common stock. In addition, KBW acted as placement agent in connection with
WashingtonFirst’s October 2015 private placement of subordinated debt securities. In the past two years, KBW has not provided
investment banking or financial advisory services to Sandy Spring for which compensation was received. KBW provided investment
banking assistance to Sandy Spring in the past two years in regard to a potential transaction that was considered but not consummated
by Sandy Spring, in connection with which KBW did not enter into an engagement agreement or receive compensation. We may in the
future provide investment banking and financial advisory services to WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring and receive compensation for
such services.

In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, analyzed and relied upon material bearing upon the financial and operating
condition of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring and bearing upon the Transaction, including among other things, the following: (i) a
draft of the Agreement dated May 15, 2017 (the most recent draft made available to us); (ii) the audited financial statements and the
Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 of WashingtonFirst; (iii) the unaudited quarterly
financial statements and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017 of WashingtonFirst; (iv) the audited
financial statements and Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 of Sandy Spring; (v) the
unaudited quarterly financial results and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2017 of Sandy Spring;
(vi) certain regulatory filings of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring including the quarterly reports on Form FR Y-9C and call reports
filed with respect to each quarter during the three-year period ended March 31, 2017 for Sandy Spring and December 31, 2016 for
WashingtonFirst and their respective subsidiaries’ call reports filed with respect to each quarter during the three-year period ended
March 31, 2017; (vii) certain other interim reports and other communications of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring to their respective
shareholders; and (viii) other financial information concerning the businesses and operations of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring that
was furnished to us by WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring or which we were otherwise directed to use for purposes of our analyses.
Our consideration of financial information and other factors that we deemed appropriate under the circumstances or relevant to our
analyses included, among others, the following: (i) the historical and current financial position and results of operations of
WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring; (ii) the assets and liabilities of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring; (iii) the nature and terms of
certain other merger transactions and business combinations in the banking industry; (iv) a comparison of certain financial and stock
market information for WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which
are publicly traded; (v) financial and operating forecasts and projections of WashingtonFirst that were prepared by, and provided to us
and discussed with us by, WashingtonFirst management and that were used and relied upon by us at the direction of such management

with the consent of the Board; (vi) publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Sandy Spring for 2017 and 2018, as well as
adjustments thereto for 2018 and assumed long-term Sandy Spring growth rates provided to us by Sandy Spring management, all of
which information was discussed with us by Sandy Spring management and used and relied upon by us based on such discussions, at
the direction of WashingtonFirst management and with the consent of the Board; and (vii) estimates regarding certain pro forma
financial effects of the Transaction on Sandy Spring (including, without limitation, the cost savings and related expenses expected to
result or be derived from the Transaction) that were prepared by, and provided to and discussed with us by, Sandy Spring management,
and used and relied upon by us based on such discussions, at the direction of WashingtonFirst management and with the consent of the
Board. We have also performed such other studies and analyses as we considered appropriate and have taken into account our
assessment of general economic, market and financial conditions and our experience in other transactions, as well as our experience in
securities valuation and knowledge of the banking industry generally. We have also participated in discussions held by the
managements of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring regarding the past and current business operations, regulatory relations, financial
condition and future prospects of their respective companies and such other matters as we have deemed relevant to our inquiry. In
addition, we have considered the results of the efforts undertaken by WashingtonFirst, with our assistance, to solicit indications of
interest from third parties regarding a potential transaction with WashingtonFirst.

In conducting our review and arriving at our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of
the financial and other information that was provided to us or that was publicly available and we have not independently verified the
accuracy or completeness of any such information or assumed any responsibility or liability for such verification, accuracy or
completeness. We have relied upon the management of WashingtonFirst as to the reasonableness and achievability of the financial and
operating forecasts and projections of WashingtonFirst referred to above (and the assumptions and bases therefor), and we have
assumed that such forecasts and projections were reasonably prepared and represent the best currently available estimates and
judgments of such management and that such forecasts and projections will be realized in the amounts and in the time periods currently
estimated by such management. We have further relied, with the consent of WashingtonFirst, upon Sandy Spring management as to the
reasonableness and achievability of the publicly available consensus “street estimates” of Sandy Spring (as adjusted for 2018), the
assumed Sandy Spring long-term growth rates, and the estimates regarding certain pro forma financial effects of the Transaction on
Sandy Spring, all as referred to above (and the assumptions and bases for all such information, including, without limitation, the cost
savings and related expenses expected to result or be derived from the Transaction), and we have assumed that all such information
was reasonably prepared and represents, or in the case of the Sandy Spring “street estimates” (as adjusted for 2018) referred to above
that such estimates are consistent with, the best currently available estimates and judgments of Sandy Spring management and that the
forecasts, projections and estimates reflected in such information will be realized in the amounts and in the time periods currently
estimated.

It is understood that the portion of the foregoing financial information of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring that was provided to
us was not prepared with the expectation of public disclosure, that all of the foregoing financial information, including the publicly
available consensus “street estimates” of Sandy Spring, is based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently uncertain,
including, without limitation, factors related to general economic and competitive conditions and that, accordingly, actual results could
vary significantly from those set forth in such information. We have assumed, based on discussions with the respective managements
of WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring and with the consent of the Board, that all such information provides a

reasonable basis upon which we could form our opinion and we express no view as to any such information or the assumptions or
bases therefor. We have relied on all such information without independent verification or analysis and do not in any respect assume
any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof.

We also assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business
or prospects of either WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring since the date of the last financial statements of each such entity that were made
available to us. We are not experts in the independent verification of the adequacy of allowances for loan and lease losses and we have
assumed, without independent verification and with your consent, that the aggregate allowances for loan and lease losses for
WashingtonFirst and Sandy Spring are adequate to cover such losses. In rendering our opinion, we have not made or obtained any
evaluations or appraisals or physical inspection of the property, assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of WashingtonFirst or
Sandy Spring, the collateral securing any of such assets or liabilities, or the collectability of any such assets, nor have we examined any
individual loan or credit files, nor did we evaluate the solvency, financial capability or fair value of WashingtonFirst or Sandy Spring
under any state or federal laws, including those relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or other matters. Estimates of values of companies
and assets do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which companies or assets may actually be sold. Because
such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty, we assume no responsibility or liability for their accuracy.

We have assumed, in all respects material to our analyses, the following: (i) that the Transaction and any related transactions
(including the Bank Merger) will be completed substantially in accordance with the terms set forth in the Agreement (the final terms of
which we have assumed will not differ in any respect material to our analyses from the draft reviewed and referred to above) with no
adjustments to the Exchange Ratio and with no other consideration or payments in respect of the WashingtonFirst Common Stock;
(ii) that the representations and warranties of each party in the Agreement and in all related documents and instruments referred to in
the Agreement are true and correct; (iii) that each party to the Agreement and all related documents will perform all of the covenants
and agreements required to be performed by such party under such documents; (iv) that there are no factors that would delay or subject
to any adverse conditions, any necessary regulatory or governmental approval for the Transaction or any related transactions (including
the Bank Merger) and that all conditions to the completion of the Transaction and any related transaction will be satisfied without any
waivers or modifications to the Agreement or any of the related documents; and (v) that in the course of obtaining the necessary
regulatory, contractual, or other consents or approvals for the Transaction and any related transaction (including the Bank Merger), no
restrictions, including any divestiture requirements, termination or other payments or amendments or modifications, will be imposed
that will have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations or financial condition of WashingtonFirst, Sandy Spring or
the pro forma entity, or the contemplated benefits of the Transaction, including without limitation the cost savings and related expenses
expected to result or be derived from the Transaction. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated in a manner that
complies with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and all other applicable federal and state statutes, rules and regulations. We have further been advised by representatives of
WashingtonFirst that WashingtonFirst has relied upon advice from its advisors (other than KBW) or other appropriate sources as to all
legal, financial reporting, tax, accounting and regulatory matters with respect to WashingtonFirst, Sandy Spring, Merger Sub, the
Transaction and any related transaction (including the Bank Merger), and the Agreement. KBW has not provided advice with respect to
any such matters.

This opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date hereof, of the Exchange Ratio in the First-
Step Merger to the holders of WashingtonFirst Common Stock, without regard to

differences between WashingtonFirst Voting Common Stock and WashingtonFirst Non-Voting Common Stock. We express no view or
opinion as to any other terms or aspects of the Transaction or any term or aspect of any related transaction (including the Bank
Merger), including without limitation, the form or structure of the Transaction or any such related transaction, any consequences of the
Transaction or any such related transaction to WashingtonFirst, its shareholders, creditors or otherwise, or any terms, aspects, merits or
implications of any employment, consulting, voting, support, shareholder or other agreements, arrangements or understandings
contemplated or entered into in connection with the Transaction or otherwise. Our opinion is necessarily based upon conditions as they
exist and can be evaluated on the date hereof and the information made available to us through the date hereof. It is understood that
subsequent developments may affect the conclusion reached in this opinion and that KBW does not have an obligation to update, revise
or reaffirm this opinion. For purposes of our analyses, we have not incorporated recently-announced proposed changes to United States
tax laws regarding corporate tax rates. Our opinion does not address, and we express no view or opinion with respect to, (i) the
underlying business decision of WashingtonFirst to engage in the Transaction or enter into the Agreement; (ii) the relative merits of the
Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that are, have been or may be available to or contemplated by WashingtonFirst or
the Board; (iii) the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to any of WashingtonFirst’s officers, directors or employees,
or any class of such persons, relative to the compensation to the holders of WashingtonFirst Common Stock; (iv) the effect of the
Transaction or any related transaction on, or the fairness of the consideration to be received by, holders of any class of securities of
WashingtonFirst (other than the holders of WashingtonFirst Common Stock solely with respect to the Exchange Ratio, as described
herein and not relative to the consideration to be received by holders of any other class of securities) or holders of any class of
securities of Sandy Spring or any other party to any transaction contemplated by the Agreement; (v) the relative fairness of the
Exchange Ratio as between holders of WashingtonFirst Voting Common Stock and holders of WashingtonFirst Non-Voting Common
Stock; (vi) any adjustment (as provided in the Agreement) to the Exchange Ratio assumed for purposes of our opinion or any other
additional consideration (as provided in the Agreement) that could be paid for WashingtonFirst Common Stock; (vii) the actual value
of Sandy Spring Common Stock to be issued in the First-Step Merger; (viii) the prices, trading range or volume at which
WashingtonFirst Voting Common Stock or Sandy Spring Common Stock will trade following the public announcement of the
Transaction or the prices, trading range or volume at which Sandy Spring Common Stock will trade following the consummation of the
Transaction; (ix) any advice or opinions provided by any other advisor to any of the parties to the Transaction or any other transaction
contemplated by the Agreement; or (x) any legal, regulatory, accounting, tax or similar matters relating to WashingtonFirst, Sandy
Spring, their respective shareholders, or relating to or arising out of or as a consequence of the Transaction or any related transaction
(including the Bank Merger), including whether or not the Transaction would qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States
federal income tax purposes.

This opinion is for the information of, and is directed to, the Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with its consideration of
the financial terms of the Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board as to how it should vote on the
Transaction, or to any holder of WashingtonFirst Voting Common Stock or any shareholder of any other entity as to how to vote in
connection with the Transaction or any other matter, nor does it constitute a recommendation regarding whether or not any such
shareholder should enter into a voting, shareholders’, or affiliates’ agreement with respect to the Transaction or exercise any dissenters’
or appraisal rights that may be available to such shareholder.

This opinion has been reviewed and approved by our Fairness Opinion Committee in conformity with our policies and procedures
established under the requirements of Rule 5150 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

Board of Directors
Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc.
17801 Georgia Avenue
Olney, MD 20832

Ladies and Gentlemen:

Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc. (“Parent”), Touchdown Acquisition, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and
WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc. (“Company”) are proposing to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”)
pursuant to which (i) Merger Sub will be merged with and into Company (the “First-Step Merger”), so that Company is the surviving
entity in the First-Step Merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, and (ii) immediately thereafter, Company, as the surviving
entity in the First-Step Merger, will merge with an into Parent (the “Second-Step Merger” and, together with the First-Step Merger, the
“Merger”), with Parent as the surviving entity in the Merger. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the First-Step Merger, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Company and each share of Non-Voting Common Stock, Series A, of Company (together, “Company Common
Stock”) that is issued and outstanding at the Effective Time, except for certain shares of Company Common Stock as specified in the
Agreement, shall become and be converted into the number of shares (the “Exchange Ratio”) of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of Parent (“Parent Common Stock”) as follows: (i) if the Parent Average Price is greater than $53.23, the Exchange Ratio shall
equal 0.8210; (ii) if the Parent Average Price is greater than $50.15 and equal to or less than $53.23, the Exchange Ratio shall equal the
quotient of $43.70 divided by the Parent Average Price; (iii) if the Parent Average Price is equal to or greater than $37.07 and equal to
or less than $50.15, the Exchange Ratio shall equal 0.8713; (iv) if the Parent Average Price is equal to or greater than $34.00 and less
than $37.07, the Exchange Ratio shall be equal to the quotient of $32.30 divided by the Parent Average Price; and (v) if the Parent
Average Price is less than $34.00, the Exchange Ratio shall equal 0.9500. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have
the meanings assigned to them in the Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Agreement.
You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Exchange Ratio to Parent.

Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. (“Sandler O’Neill”, “we” or “our”), as part of its investment banking business, is regularly
engaged in the valuation of financial institutions and their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions and other corporate
transactions. In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed and considered, among other things: (i) an execution version of the
Agreement, dated May 15, 2017; (ii) certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of Parent
and its bank subsidiary

that we deemed relevant; (iii) certain publicly available financial statements and other historical financial information of Company and
its bank subsidiary that we deemed relevant; (iv) publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for Parent for the
years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, as well as estimated dividends per share and long term earnings per share
and asset growth rates for the years thereafter, as discussed with and confirmed by the senior management of Parent; (v) publicly
available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for Company for the years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31,
2018, as well as estimated dividends per share and long term earnings per share and asset growth rates for the years thereafter, as
discussed with and confirmed by the senior management of Company; (vi) the pro forma financial impact of the Merger on Parent
based on certain assumptions relating to transaction expenses, purchase accounting adjustments and cost savings, as provided by the
senior management of Parent; (vii) the publicly reported historical price and trading activity for Parent Common Stock and Company
Common Stock, including a comparison of certain stock trading information for Parent Common Stock, Company Common Stock and
certain stock indices as well as publicly available information for certain other similar companies the securities of which are publicly
traded; (viii) a comparison of certain financial information for Parent and Company with similar bank and thrift institutions for which
information is publicly available; (ix) the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the bank and thrift industry (on a
regional and nationwide basis), to the extent publicly available; (x) the current market environment generally and the banking
environment in particular; and (xi) such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and financial, economic and
market criteria as we considered relevant. We also discussed with certain members of the senior management of Parent the business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects of Parent and held similar discussions with certain members of the senior
management of Company regarding the business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects of Company.

In performing our review, we have relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial and other information that
was available to and reviewed by us from public sources, that was provided to us by Parent, Company or their respective
representatives or that was otherwise reviewed by us and we have assumed such accuracy and completeness for purposes of rendering
this opinion without any independent verification or investigation. We have further relied on the assurances of the respective
managements of Parent and Company that they are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would make any of such information
inaccurate or misleading. We have not been asked to and have not undertaken an independent verification of any of such information
and we do not assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy or completeness thereof. We did not make an independent
evaluation or perform an appraisal of the specific assets, the collateral securing assets or the liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of
Parent or Company, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluations or appraisals. We render no opinion or evaluation on the
collectability of any assets or the future performance of any loans of Parent or Company. We did not make an independent evaluation
of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses of Parent or Company, or the combined entity after the Merger and we have not
reviewed any individual credit files relating to Parent or Company. We have assumed, with your consent, that the respective allowances
for loan losses for both Parent and Company are adequate to cover such losses and will be adequate on a pro forma basis for the
combined entity.

In preparing its analyses, Sandler O’Neill used publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for Parent for the
years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, as well as estimated dividends per share and long term earnings per share
and asset growth rates for the years thereafter, as discussed with and confirmed by the senior management of Parent. In addition, in
preparing its analyses Sandler O’Neill used publicly available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates for Company for the
years ending December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, as well as estimated dividends per share and long term earnings per

share and asset growth rates for the years thereafter, as discussed with and confirmed by the senior management of Company. Sandler
O’Neill also received and used in its pro forma analyses certain assumptions relating to transaction expenses, purchase accounting
adjustments and cost savings, as provided by the senior management of Parent. With respect to the foregoing information, the
respective managements of Parent and Company confirmed to us that such information reflected (or, in the case of the publicly
available consensus analyst earnings per share estimates referred to above, were consistent with) the best currently available estimates
and judgments of those respective managements of the future financial performance of Parent and Company, respectively, and we
assumed that such performance would be achieved. We express no opinion as to such information, or the assumptions on which such
information is based. We have also assumed that there has been no material change in Parent’s or Company’s assets, financial
condition, results of operations, business or prospects since the date of the most recent financial statements made available to us. We
have assumed in all respects material to our analysis that Parent and Company will remain as going concerns for all periods relevant to
our analyses.

We have also assumed, with your consent, in all respects material to our analysis, that (i) each of the parties to the Agreement will
comply in all material respects with all material terms and conditions of the Agreement and all related agreements, that all of the
representations and warranties contained in such agreements are true and correct in all material respects, that each of the parties to such
agreements will perform in all material respects all of the covenants and other obligations required to be performed by such party under
such agreements and that the conditions precedent in such agreements are not and will not be waived, (ii) in the course of obtaining the
necessary regulatory or third party approvals, consents and releases with respect to the Merger, no delay, limitation, restriction or
condition will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Parent, Company or the Merger or any related transaction, (iii) the
Merger and any related transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement without any waiver,
modification or amendment of any material term, condition or agreement thereof and in compliance with all applicable laws and other
requirements, and (iv) the Merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax purposes. We express no opinion as to
any of the legal, accounting or tax matters relating to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated in connection therewith.

Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof could materially affect our opinion. We have not undertaken
to update, revise, reaffirm or withdraw this opinion or otherwise comment upon events occurring after the date hereof. We express no
opinion as to the trading values of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock at any time or what the value of Parent
Common Stock will be once it is actually received by the holders of Company Common Stock.

We will receive a fee for rendering this opinion. Parent has also agreed to indemnify us against certain claims and liabilities
arising out of our engagement and to reimburse us for certain of our out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with our
engagement. Sandler O’Neill has not provided any other investment banking services to Parent in the two years preceding the date
hereof. As we previously advised you, in the two years preceding the date hereof we have provided certain investment banking services
to, and received investment banking fees from, Company. Most recently, Sandler O’Neill acted as placement agent in connection with

Our opinion is directed to the Board of Directors of Parent in connection with its consideration of the Agreement and the Merger
and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of Parent as to how any such shareholder should vote at any meeting of
shareholders called to consider and vote upon the Merger. Our opinion is directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of
the Exchange Ratio to Parent and does not address the underlying business decision of Parent to engage in the Merger, the form or
structure of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated in the Agreement, the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any
other alternative transactions or business strategies that might exist for Parent, or the effect of any other transaction in which Parent
might engage. We also do not express any opinion as to the amount or nature of the compensation to be received in the Merger by any
Parent or Company officer, director or employee, or any class of such persons, if any, relative to the amount of compensation to be
received by any other shareholder. This opinion has been approved by Sandler O’Neill’s fairness opinion committee. This opinion shall
not be reproduced or summarized without Sandler O’Neill’s prior written consent; provided, however, Sandler O’Neill will provide its
consent for the opinion to be included in regulatory filings to be completed in connection with the Merger.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio is fair to Parent from a
financial point of view.

Very truly yours,
