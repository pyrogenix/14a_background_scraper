March 13, 2017

Dear Shareholder:

You are invited to attend a special meeting of shareholders of common stock of Ixia, a California corporation (“Ixia,” the “Company,”
“we,” “us,” or “our”), to be held on April 12, 2017, at 9:00 a.m., local time, at the Sheraton Agoura Hills Hotel, located at 30100 Agoura
Road, Agoura Hills, California 91301.

At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on (1) a proposal to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of January 30, 2017, as may be amended from time to time (the “merger agreement”), by and among Ixia, Keysight Technologies, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (“Keysight”), and, by a joinder dated February 2, 2017, Keysight Acquisition, Inc., a California corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Keysight (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Ixia, with Ixia surviving
the merger (the “merger”) as a wholly owned subsidiary of Keysight, as well as the principal terms of the merger, (2) a proposal to approve
the adjournment of the special meeting if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of
the special meeting to approve the foregoing proposal, and (3) a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain
compensation that will be paid or may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the merger.

If the merger agreement and the principal terms of the merger are approved and the merger is completed, Ixia will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Keysight and, at the effective time of the merger (the “effective time”), each share of Ixia common stock (“Ixia
common stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than dissenting shares and shares owned by Keysight
or Merger Sub, or by any subsidiary of Keysight, Merger Sub, or Ixia (except to the extent held by any such person on behalf of a third
party)) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $19.65 per share in cash, without interest and
less any applicable withholding taxes required by law.

The board of directors of the Company (the “Ixia board”) has unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the merger, and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, Ixia and its shareholders and has
unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Ixia board
unanimously recommends that the shareholders of the Company vote (1) “FOR” the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the
principal terms of the merger, (2) “FOR” the proposal to approve the adjournment of the special meeting if necessary or appropriate to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to approve the merger
agreement and the principal terms of the merger, and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain
compensation that will be paid or may become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger.

The accompanying proxy statement describes the merger agreement, the merger, and the compensation that will be paid or may
become payable to the named executive officers of Ixia in connection with the merger and provides specific information concerning the
special meeting and the parties involved. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement. We urge you to
read the entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes, as it sets forth the details of the merger agreement and other important
information related to the merger. In addition, you may obtain information about us from documents we file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) from time to time. See “Where You Can Find More Information” on page 85 of the accompanying
proxy statement.

Your vote is very important. The merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Ixia
common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting vote in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the
principal terms of the merger. A failure to vote your shares of Ixia common stock on the proposal to approve the merger agreement
and the principal terms of the merger will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” such proposal.

If you have any questions or need assistance in voting your shares, please contact our proxy solicitor, D.F. King & Co., Inc., toll-free
at (877) 674-6273 or via email at ixia@dfking.com.

Sincerely,

 
Bethany Mayer
President and Chief Executive Officer

Neither the SEC nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved the merger or the merger agreement,
passed upon the merits or fairness of the merger, or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure in the accompanying
proxy statement. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

IXIA
NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

To Be Held on April 12, 2017
To the Shareholders of Ixia:

We will hold a special meeting of the shareholders of Ixia, a California corporation (“Ixia,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), at
the Sheraton Agoura Hills Hotel, located at 30100 Agoura Road, Agoura Hills, California 91301, on April 12, 2017, at 9:00 a.m., local
time (such meeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the “special meeting”). We will consider and act on the following
proposals at the special meeting:

1. To approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 30, 2017, as may be amended from time to time (the “merger
agreement”), by and among Ixia, Keysight Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Keysight”), and, by a joinder dated
February 2, 2017, Keysight Acquisition, Inc., a California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Keysight (“Merger
Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Ixia, with Ixia surviving the merger (the “merger”) as a
wholly owned subsidiary of Keysight, as well as the principal terms of the merger (the “Merger Proposal”);

2. To approve the adjournment of the special meeting if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal”); and

3. To approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will be paid or may become payable to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger (the “Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal”), as disclosed pursuant to Item
402(t) of Regulation S-K in “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute
Compensation” beginning on page 52 of the accompanying proxy statement.

The accompanying proxy statement and its annexes more fully describe these items of business. We urge you to read this information
carefully.

The Ixia Board of Directors unanimously recommends that the shareholders of the Company vote (1) “FOR” the Merger
Proposal, (2) “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal, and (3) “FOR” the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal.

Only shareholders of record of shares of Ixia common stock at the close of business on March 13, 2017, the record date for the special
meeting (the “record date”), are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting and any adjournments or postponements of the
special meeting. If you have any questions concerning the merger, the special meeting, or the accompanying proxy statement, need help
voting your shares of Ixia common stock, or would like additional copies of the accompanying proxy statement or proxy card, without
charge, please contact Ixia’s proxy solicitor, D.F. King & Co., Inc., using the information below:

Toll-free: (877) 674-6273
Collect: (212) 269-5550
Email: ixia@dfking.com

Shareholders of record of shares of Ixia common stock are entitled to dissenters’ rights under Chapter 13 of the General Corporation
Law of the State of California (the “CGCL”) in connection with the merger if they satisfy certain requirements. See “The Merger—
Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 57 of the accompanying proxy statement. A copy of Chapter 13 of the CGCL is attached to this
proxy statement as Annex D.

Your vote is very important. It is important that your shares be represented and voted whether or not you plan to attend the special
meeting in person. You may vote by completing and mailing the proxy card enclosed with the accompanying proxy statement, or you may
grant your proxy electronically via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on the proxy card. If your shares are held in
“street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank, or other nominee, you should instruct your broker, bank, or
nominee how to vote your shares using the voting instruction form furnished by your broker, bank, or nominee. Submitting a proxy over
the Internet, by telephone, or by mailing a proxy card will ensure your shares are represented at the special meeting. If you do not vote or
do not instruct your broker, bank, or nominee how to vote, it will have the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.

Please vote promptly whether or not you expect to attend the Ixia special meeting.

By Order of the Board of Directors,

 
Matthew S. Alexander
Corporate Secretary

SUMMARY TERM SHEET

This summary term sheet, together with the following section of this proxy statement entitled “Questions and Answers About
the Merger and the Special Meeting,” highlights selected information from this proxy statement and may not contain all of the
information that is important to you as a shareholder of Ixia or that you should consider before voting on the Merger Proposal.
To better understand the merger, you should read carefully this entire proxy statement and all of its annexes, including the merger
agreement, which is attached as Annex A, before voting on the Merger Proposal. Each item in this summary includes a page
reference directing you to a more complete description of that item. In this proxy statement, the terms “Ixia,” “Company,” “we,”
“our,” “ours,” and “us” refer to Ixia. We refer to Keysight Technologies, Inc. as “Keysight” and Keysight Acquisition, Inc. as
“Merger Sub.”

The Parties (page 19)

U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

Keysight Acquisition, Inc.

Merger Sub, a California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Keysight, was organized on February 1, 2017, solely
for the purpose of becoming a party to the merger agreement with Ixia and Keysight and completing the merger with Ixia, and has
not conducted any business operations other than those incident to its formation and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. Subsequent to signing the merger agreement, on February 2, 2017, Merger Sub, Keysight, and Ixia entered into a
joinder, pursuant to which Merger Sub agreed to be bound by the merger agreement and will be the Keysight subsidiary which
will merge with and into Ixia. If the merger is completed, Merger Sub will cease to exist by operation of law following its merger
with and into Ixia.

The Merger (page 28)

Ixia entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 30, 2017, as may be amended from time to time (the
“merger agreement”), by and among Ixia, Keysight Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and, by a joinder dated February
2, 2017, Keysight Acquisition, Inc., a California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Keysight. Pursuant to the merger
agreement, subject to the approval of the merger agreement and the principal terms of the merger by our shareholders and the
satisfaction of other conditions to the completion of the merger specified in the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged
with and into Ixia, with Ixia continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Keysight (the “merger”).
We encourage you to carefully read the merger agreement in its entirety, which is the principal document governing the merger.
The merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Upon the completion of the merger, each share of Ixia common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger (the “effective time”) (other than shares held by holders who have properly perfected their dissenters’ rights under
Chapter 13 of the General Corporation Law of the State of California (the “CGCL”), a copy of which is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex D (the “dissenting shares”), and shares owned by Keysight or Merger Sub, or by any subsidiary of Keysight,
Merger Sub, or Ixia), will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $19.65
per share (the “merger consideration”) payable in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes required by
law.

Treatment of Ixia Equity Awards (page 63)

Stock Options. Each stock option to purchase shares of Ixia common stock issued under the Second Amended and Restated
Ixia 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (each, an “Ixia stock option”), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time will, at the effective time, automatically become fully vested (to the extent not then vested) and be cancelled
in consideration for the right to receive, following the effective time, a cash payment equal to the product of (a) the total number
of shares of Ixia common stock subject to such cancelled Ixia stock option immediately prior to the effective time and (b) the
excess, if any, of (1) the merger consideration of $19.65 per share over (2) the exercise price per share of such cancelled Ixia
stock option, without interest and as reduced by the amount of any tax withholding required by law (collectively, the “option
payments”). Each Ixia stock option with respect to which, immediately prior to the effective time, the exercise price per share
subject thereto is equal to or greater than $19.65 will be cancelled at the effective time in exchange for no consideration.

Restricted Stock Unit Awards. At the effective time, each Ixia restricted stock unit award granted pursuant to the Second
Amended and Restated Ixia 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time (each, an “Ixia RSU”) will automatically become fully vested and be cancelled in consideration for the right to
receive, following the effective time, a cash payment equal to the product of (a) the total number of shares of Ixia common stock
subject to such Ixia RSU immediately prior to the effective time and (b) the merger consideration of $19.65 per share, without
interest and as reduced by the amount of any tax withholding required by law (collectively, including payments described in the
next sentence, the “RSU payments”). If, immediately prior to the effective time, an Ixia RSU remains subject to a performance-
based vesting condition (each, an “Ixia PRSU”), such Ixia PRSU will, at such time and in accordance with the terms thereof,
become earned at the target performance level, and such Ixia PRSU will, at the effective time, become fully vested and be
cancelled in consideration for the right to receive, following the effective time, a cash payment with respect thereto that is the
same as the cash payment described in the preceding sentence for other Ixia RSUs that are cancelled at the effective time.

Ixia, as the surviving corporation in the merger, will cause the option payments and the RSU payments to be paid, less any
required tax withholdings, as promptly as practicable following the effective time (and not later than the first regularly scheduled
payroll date on or after the fifth business day after the effective time) through its payroll systems.

Treatment of Ixia Employee Stock Purchase Plan (page 63)

Commencing on January 30, 2017, Ixia’s 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the “Ixia ESPP”), ceased to
accept any new participants, and no participant in the Ixia ESPP is permitted to alter his or her contributions after such date (other
than to discontinue participation in the Ixia ESPP). No new offering periods may be commenced under the Ixia ESPP after
January 30, 2017, and any offering periods in effect as of January 30, 2017 will be terminated effective as of (a) the last day of
the current purchase period or (b) if earlier, prior to the effective time, and all amounts then credited to the accounts of
participants will be used to purchase shares of Ixia common stock in accordance with the terms of the Ixia ESPP. All accumulated
contributions of each participant as of the termination of the Ixia ESPP that are not used to purchase shares of Ixia common stock
pursuant to the Ixia ESPP will be returned to the participants, without interest. The Ixia ESPP will be terminated as of the
effective time.

The Ixia Special Meeting (page 20)

The special meeting of Ixia shareholders will be held on April 12, 2017 at 9:00 a.m., local time (the “special meeting”). At
the special meeting, Ixia shareholders will be asked to vote on (a) the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

principal terms of the merger, (b) the proposal for the adjournment of the special meeting if necessary or appropriate to solicit
additional proxies in the event that there are not sufficient votes in favor of approval of the merger agreement and the principal
terms of the merger at the time of the special meeting, (c) the non-binding, advisory proposal on certain compensation to be paid
to our named executive officers or may become payable in connection with the merger, and (d) any other business as may
properly come before the special meeting and any adjournment(s) or postponement(s) thereof.

Shareholders Entitled to Vote; Record Date (page 20)

Only holders of shares of Ixia common stock as of March 13, 2017, the record date for the determination of shareholders
entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting (the “record date”), may vote at the special meeting. For each share of Ixia
common stock that you owned on the record date, you are entitled to cast one vote on each matter to be voted upon at the special
meeting. On the record date, there were 83,201,627 shares of Ixia common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, held by
approximately 13 shareholders of record.

Quorum and Vote Required (page 20)

A quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold the special meeting. The required quorum for the transaction of business at
the special meeting will exist when the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Ixia common stock entitled to vote at
the special meeting are present in person or represented by proxy. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that
the special meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies. Abstentions and “broker non-votes” count as present for
establishing a quorum.

Approval of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this document, and the principal terms of the
merger (the “Merger Proposal”) requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Ixia
common stock as of the record date. Failure to vote, by proxy or in person, will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the
Merger Proposal. The adjournment of the special meeting if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal”) will be
approved if a majority of the shares of Ixia common stock, present in person or represented by proxy and voting on the subject
matter, vote in favor of the proposal, whether or not a quorum is present. Certain compensation that will be paid or may become
payable to our named executive officers in connection with the merger (the “Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal”) will be
approved if a majority of the shares of Ixia common stock, present in person or represented by proxy and voting on the proposal,
vote in favor of the proposal, provided such shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum
for the meeting.

Shares Owned by Our Directors and Executive Officers (page 21)

As of March 13, 2017, the record date, our directors and executive officers were entitled to vote approximately 18,592,392
shares of Ixia common stock, or approximately 22.3% of the total number of shares of Ixia common stock outstanding on that
date. These numbers do not give effect to outstanding Ixia stock options or Ixia RSUs, which do not represent shares entitled to
vote at the special meeting. In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, the Company and Keysight have entered
into a Voting and Support Agreement, dated as of January 30, 2017 (each, a “support agreement”), with each of (i) Laurent
Asscher, a director, and (ii) Errol Ginsberg, the Chairman of the Ixia board of directors (the “Ixia board”) and Chief Innovation
Officer, and related entities for whom they have shared voting power over shares of Ixia common stock owned by such entities,
obligating them to vote all of their and such entities’ shares of Ixia common stock in favor of the Merger Proposal and any other
proposals necessary to consummate the merger. For additional information regarding the support agreements, see “The Voting and
Support Agreements” beginning on page 78 of this proxy statement.

We currently expect that each of our directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposals to be
presented at the special meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

We have never declared or paid cash dividends on Ixia common stock, and we do not have any present intention to
commence payment of any cash dividends. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, no dividends may be paid by us
without the prior written consent of Keysight.

Recommendation of the Ixia Board; Reasons for the Merger (page 37)

The Ixia board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal,
and “FOR” the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal.

The Ixia board’s reasons for approving the merger agreement, the merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement; certain factors the Ixia board considered in its deliberations in approving merger agreement, the merger, and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; and the Ixia board’s recommendation to our shareholders are
discussed in “The Merger—Recommendation of the Ixia Board; Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 37 of this proxy
statement.

Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 49)

In considering the recommendation of the Ixia board that the shareholders vote to approve the merger agreement and the
principal terms of the merger, shareholders should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger
that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of our shareholders generally. Interests of the directors and executive
officers are or may be different from or in addition to the interests of the shareholders for the following reasons, among others:
potential employment of our executive officers following the merger with Keysight, with the surviving corporation, or with one
of their respective affiliates; the treatment pursuant to the merger agreement of outstanding Ixia stock options and Ixia RSUs held
by them; potential change in control severance compensation and benefits payable to them under our officer severance plans; and
their rights under the merger agreement to ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage. The members of the Ixia board were
aware of such different or additional interests and considered those interests, among other matters, in negotiating, evaluating, and
approving the merger and the merger agreement, and in recommending to the shareholders that the merger agreement and the
principal terms of the merger be approved. These interests are discussed in more detail in “The Merger—Interests of Our
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 49 of this proxy statement.

Opinion of Ixia’s Financial Advisor (page 40 and Annex C)

At a January 29, 2017 meeting of the Ixia board, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (“Deutsche Bank”), financial advisor to Ixia,
rendered its oral opinion to the Ixia board, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated January 30, 2017, to the effect that, as
of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and
limitations, qualifications, and conditions on the review undertaken in connection therewith, as described in Deutsche Bank’s
opinion, the consideration of $19.65 in cash per share of Ixia common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Ixia common stock (other than Keysight and its affiliates).

The full text of Deutsche Bank’s written opinion, dated January 30, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations, qualifications, and conditions on the review undertaken in
connection with the opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and is incorporated herein by reference. The
summary of Deutsche Bank’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of the opinion. Deutsche Bank’s opinion was addressed to, and for the use and benefit of, the Ixia board in connection
with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the merger. Deutsche Bank’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation
as to how any holder of Ixia common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any related matter. Deutsche Bank’s
opinion was limited solely to the fairness of the consideration of $19.65 in cash per share of Ixia common stock, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of outstanding Ixia common stock (other than Keysight and its affiliates), and
Deutsche Bank did not express any opinion as to the underlying decision by Ixia to engage in the merger or the relative
merits of the merger as compared to any alternative transactions or business strategies.

Delisting and Deregistration of Shares of Ixia Common Stock (page 54)

If the merger is completed, Ixia common stock will be delisted from NASDAQ and deregistered under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

• each of Keysight and Merger Sub having performed, or complied with, in all material respects all obligations required
to be performed by or complied with by it under the merger agreement on or prior to the closing date; and

• Ixia having received an officer’s certificate signed by an executive officer of each of Keysight and Merger Sub,
certifying as to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the two preceding bullet points.

Non-Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals; Change in Recommendation (page 68)

Ixia is subject to customary restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and to
provide information to, and enter into discussions or negotiations with, third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals.
However, prior to the shareholder approval of the merger, the solicitation restrictions are subject to a customary “fiduciary-out”
provision that allows Ixia to provide information to and participate in negotiations or discussions with third parties with respect to
an alternative acquisition proposal that did not result from a breach by Ixia or its representatives of the non-solicitation
obligations in the merger agreement, if the Ixia board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that such alternative acquisition proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior
proposal, subject to compliance with other terms of the merger agreement.

Prior to the approval of the merger by Ixia’s shareholders and subject to compliance with the relevant requirements under the
merger agreement, the Ixia board may change its recommendation with respect to the merger in the event of, and Ixia may
terminate the merger agreement (with payment of a termination fee of approximately $59.7 million to Keysight) in order to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to, an alternative acquisition proposal that did not result from a breach by Ixia or its
representatives of the non-solicitation obligations in the merger agreement and that the Ixia board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a superior proposal (as described in more detail in
“The Merger Agreement__Non-Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals; Change in Recommendation”), in each case, if the Ixia board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with the Ixia board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law. Prior to taking these actions, Ixia must provide Keysight
with at least five business days’ prior written notice of such action and a five business day period in which to negotiate with Ixia,
and will negotiate with Keysight in good faith, in order to amend the terms of the merger such that the acquisition proposal no
longer constitutes a superior proposal.

In addition, prior to the approval of the merger by Ixia’s shareholders, the Ixia board may change its recommendation with
respect to the merger for an intervening event (as defined under “The Merger Agreement__Non-Solicitation; Acquisition
Proposals; Change in Recommendation”) unrelated to an acquisition proposal if it determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Ixia board’s
fiduciary duties under applicable law, provided that the Ixia board gives Keysight at least five business days’ prior written notice
of such action and a five business day period in which to negotiate with Ixia so as to avoid such recommendation change.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (page 75)

The merger agreement may be terminated and the merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the effective time as
follows:

• by mutual written consent of Ixia and Keysight;

• by either Keysight or Ixia, if:

• the closing has not occurred by 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on October 30, 2017 (the “end date”), provided neither
Keysight nor Ixia may terminate the merger agreement if its breach or failure to perform or comply with any
obligation under the merger agreement resulted in or was a primary cause of the failure of the closing to occur by
the end date;

• any competent governmental authority will have enacted, entered, or enforced any final and non-appealable order
or law permanently enjoining, restraining, prohibiting, or making illegal the consummation of the merger,
provided that (a) the party seeking to terminate the merger

postponement thereof;

requisite Ixia shareholder approval;

agreement, which has prevented or would prevent the satisfaction of any condition to the obligation of Ixia to
complete the merger, and is not capable of being cured by the end date or, to the extent so curable, has not been
cured by Keysight and Merger Sub within 30 days after receiving written notice from Ixia describing such
violation or breach (or, if earlier, by the end date);

• prior to the time at which the requisite Ixia shareholder approval has been obtained, Ixia concurrently enters into a
definitive alternative acquisition agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal that the Ixia board has
concluded constitutes a superior proposal (subject to the payment of the Ixia termination fee prior to or
concurrently with such termination); or

• (a) all of the conditions to the obligations of Keysight and Merger Sub to complete the merger have been satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the closing itself, each of
which is capable of being satisfied at such time), (b) Ixia has delivered a written notice to Keysight certifying that
all of the conditions to Ixia’s obligation to complete the merger have been satisfied (or would be satisfied if the
closing were to occur on the date of such notice), and Ixia stands ready, willing, and able to complete the merger at
such time, and (c) Keysight fails to complete the merger by the third business day after the later of delivery of such
notice and the date on which the closing should have occurred under the terms of the merger agreement.

Transaction Expenses; Termination Fees (page 76)

Transaction Expenses

Each party will generally pay its own fees and expenses in connection with the merger. Keysight will pay all filing fees
payable under the antitrust laws in connection with the merger.

Ixia Termination Fee

Ixia must pay Keysight a termination fee of approximately $59.7 million if:

• the merger agreement is terminated by Ixia in order to concurrently enter into a definitive alternative acquisition
agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal that the Ixia board has concluded constitutes a superior proposal;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• the merger agreement is terminated by Keysight because (a) the Ixia board has effected an adverse recommendation
change, (b) Ixia has violated or breached in any material respect any of its non-solicitation obligations under the merger
agreement, or (c) Ixia has violated or breached its obligations under the merger agreement with respect to the Ixia
shareholders meeting in a manner that has a material adverse impact on the timing of, or the ability to obtain, the
requisite Ixia shareholder approval; or

• the merger agreement is terminated (a) by Ixia or, subject to certain limitations, Keysight because the closing has not
occurred by the end date, (b) by either party because the Ixia shareholder approval of the merger agreement and the
principal terms of the merger is not obtained at the Ixia shareholders meeting or at any adjournment or postponement
thereof, or (c) by Keysight because of a violation or breach of the merger agreement by Ixia which has prevented or
would prevent the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Keysight and Merger Sub to complete the merger,
and in any such case (i) prior to the termination of the merger agreement (or the date of the Ixia shareholders meeting in
the case of the preceding clause (b)), an acquisition proposal will have been publicly announced and not publicly
withdrawn or been communicated to the management of Ixia or the Ixia board and (ii) within 12 months after such
termination, Ixia enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal and such acquisition
proposal is thereafter consummated, or Ixia consummates the transactions contemplated by any acquisition proposal.

Keysight Termination Fee

Keysight must pay Ixia a termination fee of $500 million in the event the merger agreement is terminated by Ixia if (a) all of
the conditions to the obligations of Keysight and Merger Sub to complete the merger have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the closing itself, each of which is capable of being satisfied at
such time), (b) Ixia has delivered a written notice to Keysight certifying that all of the conditions to Ixia’s obligations to complete
the merger have been satisfied (or would be satisfied if the closing were to occur on the date of such notice), and Ixia stands
ready, willing, and able to complete the merger at such time, and (c) Keysight fails to complete the merger by the third business
day after the later of delivery of such notice and the date on which the closing should have occurred under the terms of the merger
agreement.

Limitation on Remedies

Upon termination of the merger agreement, Keysight’s and Ixia’s rights, if any, to receive the applicable termination fee
described above will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Keysight, Merger Sub, and Ixia against the other parties for any loss
suffered as a result of any breach of the merger agreement or the failure of the merger to be completed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no party will be relieved from any liabilities or damages resulting from any fraud or willful breach (as defined in the
merger agreement) committed by such party prior to such termination, except in the case of a termination of the merger
agreement by Ixia entitling Ixia to receive the termination fee from Keysight described above.

Financing of the Merger (page 60)

Consummation of the merger is not subject to Keysight’s ability to obtain financing. However, Keysight expects to obtain
financing for a portion of the consideration for the merger.

Keysight expects to finance the merger and related fees and expenses with a combination of cash on hand, the issuance of
new senior notes and/or equity securities, and borrowings under new or existing credit facilities. In the event that the sum of the
proceeds of such new senior notes, equity securities, and the borrowings under new or existing credit facilities (limited to
$170,000,000 in the case of revolving borrowings) is less than $1,684,000,000, the difference will be available under a bridge
facility described below, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

On January 30, 2017, Keysight entered into a commitment letter (the “bridge commitment letter”) with Goldman Sachs
Bank USA (“Goldman Sachs Bank”), BNP Paribas, and BNP Paribas Securities Corp. pursuant to which Goldman Sachs Bank
and BNP Paribas have each committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the bridge commitment letter,
50% of a 364-day $1,684,000,000 senior unsecured bridge facility (the “bridge facility” and the provision of such funds as set
forth in the bridge commitment letter, the

“bridge financing”). The bridge facility is available to finance the merger and to pay related fees and expenses related thereto to
the extent that Keysight does not finance such consideration and fees and expenses through the issuance of new senior notes,
equity securities, and borrowings under new or existing credit facilities as described above. Goldman Sachs Bank’s and BNP
Paribas’ commitment to provide the bridge financing is subject to certain customary closing conditions. Goldman Sachs Bank and
BNP Paribas Securities Corp. are the joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners for the bridge facility, and Goldman Sachs Bank
will be the administrative agent thereof.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (page 54)

The merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder (as defined in “The
Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 54 of this proxy statement) whose shares of Ixia
common stock are cancelled and converted into cash in the merger will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares (determined before the
deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and the holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A non-U.S. holder (as defined
in “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 54 of this proxy statement) whose shares
of Ixia common stock are cancelled and converted into cash in the merger will generally not be required to recognize gain or loss
for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless the non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the United States.

See “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 54 of this proxy statement for a
more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. The tax consequences of the merger to you
will depend on your particular tax situation. You should consult your tax advisor for a complete analysis of the U.S. federal, state,
local, and/or foreign tax consequences of the merger to you.

Regulatory Matters (page 56)

Under the HSR Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the
“FTC”), the merger cannot be consummated until, among other things, notifications have been given and certain information has
been furnished to the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), and all applicable waiting
periods have expired or been terminated. Ixia and Keysight filed their respective notification and report forms pursuant to the
HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC on February 15, 2017, and each requested “early termination” of the waiting period. Early
termination of the waiting period was granted on February 27, 2017.

A pre-merger filing and governmental approval under antitrust laws is also required in Germany, Israel, and Russia. The
parties made the required pre-merger filings with the applicable governmental authorities in Germany and Israel.

Dissenters’ Rights (page 57 and Annex D)

Shareholders of Ixia common stock who vote their shares of Ixia common stock “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal and who
properly demand the purchase of such shares in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL will not have such shares converted
into the right to receive consideration otherwise payable to holders of Ixia common stock at the effective time, but such shares
will instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due pursuant to Chapter 13 of
the CGCL.

Under Chapter 13 of the CGCL, holders of Ixia common stock must satisfy each of the following requirements to qualify
such Ixia common stock as dissenting shares: (i) the Ixia common stock must have been outstanding on March 13, 2017, the
record date for the special meeting; (ii) the Ixia common stock must have been voted “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal; (iii) the
holder of such Ixia common stock must make a written demand that is received by us or our transfer agent no later than the date
of the special meeting that we purchase such Ixia common stock at fair market value (as defined below); (iv) the holder of such
shares of Ixia common stock must submit to Ixia or our transfer agent (A) if the shares are certificated securities, certificates
representing such shares which the holder demands that Ixia purchase for endorsement or (B) if such shares are uncertificated
securities, written notice of the number of shares which such holder demands that we purchase, all in accordance with Section
1302 of the CGCL; and (v) the holder of such shares of Ixia common stock must comply with all other requirements set forth in
Chapter 13 of the CGCL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal does not in and of itself constitute a demand for dissenting shareholder rights
under California law. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Chapter 13 of the CGCL may result in the
loss of a shareholder’s statutory dissenters’ rights. A copy of Chapter 13 of the CGCL is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex D. See “The Merger—Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 57 of this proxy statement for additional information.

Litigation Related to the Merger (page 60)

Two purported class action complaints relating to the merger have been filed in the United States District court for the
Central District of California on behalf of putative classes of Ixia’s public shareholders. The first action was filed on February 23,
2017, and is captioned Witmer v. Ixia, et al., Case No. 2:17-cv-01483. The second action was filed on March 8, 2017, and is
captioned Krishna v. Ixia, et al., Case No. 2:17-cv-01840. The actions name as defendants Ixia and its directors, as well as
Keysight and Merger Sub. The actions assert similar claims relating to Ixia’s disclosures in connection with the merger. Both
complaints allege, among other things, that Ixia omitted material information with respect to the proposed merger from the
preliminary proxy statement that it filed with the SEC on February 15, 2017, in connection with the proposed merger and that, as
a result, (i) Ixia and the members of the Ixia Board violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated
thereunder, and (ii) such directors, as well as Keysight and Merger Sub, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiff in
the Witmer action seeks an order enjoining the proposed merger or, if the merger is consummated, rescinding the merger or
awarding rescissory damages; an order requiring that the directors disseminate a revised proxy statement; and an award of the
plaintiff's costs of the action, including reasonable attorneys' and experts' fees. Plaintiff in the Krishna action seeks an order
enjoining the proposed merger and awarding the plaintiff her costs of the action, including reasonable attorneys' and experts' fees.

We believe both complaints are without merit.

Additional Information (page 85)

You can find more information about Ixia in the periodic reports and other information we file with the SEC. The information is
available at the SEC’s public reference facilities and at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov. See “Where You Can

TABLE OF CONTENTS

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE SPECIAL MEETING

The following questions and answers briefly address some questions you may have regarding the special meeting and the
proposed merger. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a shareholder of Ixia.
Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement, and
the documents referred to in this proxy statement. We encourage you to read this proxy statement, including the annexes, in its
entirety because it explains the proposed merger, the documents related to the merger, and other related matters.

Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement and proxy card?

A: You are receiving this proxy statement and proxy card because, as of the record date, you owned shares of Ixia common stock.
We have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 30, 2017, as may be amended from time to time,
with Keysight and, by a joinder dated February 2, 2017, Merger Sub. Pursuant to the merger agreement, subject to the approval
of the merger agreement and the principal terms of the merger by our shareholders and the satisfaction of other conditions to
the completion of the merger specified in the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Ixia, with Ixia
surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Keysight, and Ixia common stock will be delisted from NASDAQ. A
copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A.

In order to complete the merger, our shareholders must vote to approve the merger agreement and the principal terms of the
merger. We will hold a special meeting of our shareholders to obtain this approval. The Ixia board is providing this proxy
statement to give you information for use in determining how to vote on the proposals submitted to our shareholders at the
special meeting. You should read this proxy statement and the annexes incorporated by reference herein carefully. The enclosed
proxy card and voting instructions allow you, as a shareholder of Ixia, to have your shares voted at the special meeting without
attending the special meeting. Your proxy is being solicited by the Ixia board.

Your vote is very important. If you do not vote or do not instruct your broker, bank, or nominee how to vote, it will have
the same effect as voting “AGAINST” the approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated under
the merger agreement. We encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible.

Q: As a holder of Ixia common stock, what will I be entitled to receive in the merger?

A: Upon the completion of the merger, each share of Ixia common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time,
excluding the dissenting shares and shares owned by Keysight or Merger Sub, or by any subsidiary of Keysight, Merger Sub, or
Ixia, immediately prior to the effective time (except to the extent held by any such person on behalf of a third party), will be
automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $19.65 per share payable in cash,
without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes required by law. For example, if you own 100 shares of Ixia common
stock, you will be entitled to receive $1,965 in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes required by law, in
exchange for your shares. Any withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder of Ixia
common stock in respect of whose shares the withholding was made.

Q: What will holders of Ixia equity awards receive in the merger?

A: Ixia Stock Options. Each Ixia stock option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time will, at the effective time, automatically become fully vested (to the extent not then vested) and be cancelled in
consideration for the right to receive, following the effective time, a cash payment equal to the product of (a) the total number
of shares of Ixia common stock subject to such cancelled Ixia stock option immediately prior to the effective time and (b) the
excess, if any, of (1) the merger consideration of $19.65 per share over (2) the exercise price per share of such cancelled Ixia
stock option, without interest and as reduced by the amount of any tax withholding required by law. Each Ixia stock option with
respect to which, immediately prior to the effective time, the exercise price per share subject thereto is equal to or greater than
$19.65 will be cancelled at the effective time in exchange for no consideration.

Ixia Restricted Stock Unit Awards. At the effective time, each Ixia RSU will automatically become fully vested and be
cancelled in consideration for the right to receive, following the effective time, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the
product of (a) the total number of shares of Ixia common stock

TABLE OF CONTENTS

subject to such Ixia RSU immediately prior to the effective time and (b) the merger consideration of $19.65 per share, without
interest and as reduced by the amount of any tax withholding required by law. If immediately prior to the effective time, an Ixia
RSU remains subject to a performance-based vesting condition, such Ixia PRSU will, at such time and in accordance with the
terms thereof, become earned at the target performance level, and such Ixia PRSU will, at the effective time, become fully
vested and be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive, following the effective time, a cash payment with respect
thereto that is the same as the cash payment described in the preceding sentence for other Ixia RSUs that are cancelled at the
effective time.

Ixia, as the surviving corporation in the merger, will cause the option payments and the RSU payments to be paid, less any
required tax withholdings, as promptly as practicable following the effective time (and not later than the first regularly
scheduled payroll date on or after the fifth business day after the effective time) through its payroll systems.

Q: How does the merger consideration compare to the market price of Ixia common stock?

A: The merger consideration of $19.65 per share of Ixia common stock represents a premium of (i) approximately 45% to Ixia’s
unaffected closing stock price on December 1, 2016, the last trading day prior to a media report that Ixia was considering
strategic alternatives, (ii) approximately 38% to Ixia’s unaffected 52-week high closing stock price for the period ended
December 1, 2016, and (iii) approximately 8% over the closing price of the shares of Ixia common stock on January 27, 2017,
the last completed trading day prior to the public announcement that Ixia entered into the merger agreement.

On March 10, 2017, the most recent practicable date prior to the date of this proxy statement, the closing price per share of Ixia
common stock was $19.55.

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed?

A: We are working toward completing the merger as quickly as possible and expect to complete the merger no later than October
30, 2017. However, because there are certain conditions that must be met before completing the merger, we cannot be certain of
the timing of the completion of the merger.

Q: What are Ixia shareholders being asked to vote on and why is this approval necessary?

A: Ixia shareholders are being asked to vote on the following proposals:

1. To approve the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this document, and the principal terms of the
merger;

2. To approve the adjournment of the special meeting if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the merger proposal; and

3. To approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will be paid or may become payable to our named
executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in “The Merger—
Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 52
of this proxy statement.

Ixia shareholder approval of the Merger Proposal is required for completion of the merger. Ixia shareholder approval of the
Adjournment Proposal and the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal is not required for completion of the merger. No
other matters are intended to be brought before the special meeting by Ixia.

Q: How does the Ixia board recommend that I vote?

A: The Ixia board unanimously recommends that you vote:

• “FOR” the Merger Proposal,

• “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal, and

• “FOR” the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: Why is the Ixia board recommending that I vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal?

A: After careful consideration, the Ixia board unanimously determined that the merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the merger agreement, is fair to, and in the best interests of, Ixia and its shareholders and unanimously approved and
declared advisable the merger agreement, the merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in
accordance with the requirements of the CGCL. In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the merger, and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, to
recommend, to our shareholders the approval of the Merger Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal, and the Golden Parachute
Compensation Proposal, the Ixia board consulted with Ixia’s management (the “Ixia management” or “our management”), as
well as our legal and financial advisors, and considered the terms of the merger agreement. The Ixia board also considered each
of the items set forth under “The Merger—Recommendation of the Ixia Board; Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page 37
of this proxy statement.

Q: What do I need to do now?

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this proxy statement, please vote your shares of Ixia
common stock as soon as possible so that your shares will be represented at the special meeting. Please follow the instructions
set forth on the proxy card or on the voting instruction form provided by the record holder if your shares are held in “street
name” through your broker, bank, or other nominee.

Q: How do I cast my vote?

A: Before you vote, you should read this proxy statement in its entirety, including its annexes, and carefully consider how the
merger affects you after consulting with your legal, tax, accounting, financial, and other advisors.

If you were a holder of record on the record date, you may vote in person at the special meeting, by completing, signing,
dating, and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying pre-addressed, postage paid envelope, or you may vote
electronically via the Internet, or by telephone by following the instructions on the proxy card.

If, as a shareholder of record, you sign, date, and mail your proxy and do not indicate how you want to vote, your proxy will be
voted “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal, and “FOR” the Golden Parachute Compensation
Proposal.

If you hold your shares in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank, or nominee, you must
provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares in accordance with the voting instructions
provided by your broker, bank, or nominee. If you do not provide your broker, bank, or nominee with instructions on how to
vote your shares, it will not be permitted to vote your shares. These are referred to generally as “broker non-votes.” A broker
non-vote occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner returns a valid proxy but does not vote on a particular
proposal because the nominee has not received instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. Also, please note that if
your shares are held in “street name” and you wish to vote at the special meeting in person, you must bring to the special
meeting a legal proxy from the record holder of the shares authorizing you to vote at the special meeting.

Q: When and where is the special meeting?

A: The special meeting of our shareholders will convene on April 12, 2017 at 9:00 a.m., local time, at the Sheraton Agoura Hills
Hotel, located at 30100 Agoura Road, Agoura Hills, California 91301.

Q: Who can vote at the special meeting?

A: All holders of record of Ixia common stock as of the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive notice of, and to
vote at, the special meeting. Each holder of Ixia common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought
before the special meeting for each share of Ixia common stock

that such holder owned as of the record date. If you want to attend and vote your shares of Ixia common stock at the special
meeting, and your shares are held in “street name” through your broker, bank, or other nominee, then you must bring to the
special meeting a legal proxy from the record holder of the shares authorizing you to vote at the special meeting.

Q: Do any of Ixia’s directors or executive officers have interests in the merger that may differ from those of the
shareholders?

A: Yes. Our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of
the shareholders. See “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 49 of
this proxy statement. The members of the Ixia board were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in
evaluating the merger agreement and the merger and in recommending that the shareholders vote to approve the merger.

Q: What vote of Ixia’s shareholders is required to approve the Merger Proposal?

A: Approval of the Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Ixia
common stock. If you do not vote or do not instruct your broker, bank, or nominee how to vote, it will have the same
effect as voting “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.

Q: What vote of Ixia’s shareholders is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal?

A: The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Ixia common stock, present in person or represented by proxy at the special
meeting and voting on the subject matter, is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal, whether or not a quorum is present.

Q: What vote of Ixia’s shareholders is required to approve the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal?

A: The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Ixia common stock, present in person or represented by proxy at the special
meeting and voting on the subject matter, is required to approve the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal, provided such
shares voting affirmatively also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum for the meeting.

The shareholders’ vote regarding the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal is an advisory vote and, therefore, is not
binding on Ixia, the Ixia board or the Compensation Committee of the Ixia board (the “Compensation Committee”). Since
compensation that will be paid or may become payable in connection with the merger is based on the rights of the named
executive officers under the merger agreement and our officer severance plans, the outcome of this advisory vote will not affect
the obligation to make these payments, and assuming the merger is approved, these payments may still be made even if the
shareholders do not approve, by a non-binding, advisory vote, the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal.

Q: How many votes am I entitled to cast for each share of Ixia common stock I own?

A: For each share of Ixia common stock that you owned on the record date, you are entitled to cast one vote on each matter to be
voted upon at the special meeting. As of the record date, there were 83,201,627 shares of Ixia common stock outstanding and
entitled to vote, held by approximately 13 holders of record.

Q: What constitutes a quorum?

A: A quorum must be present for our shareholders to be able to transact business at the special meeting. A quorum is present when
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the special meeting are present at the special meeting in
person or represented by proxy. If a quorum is not present or represented by proxy, the special meeting may be adjourned for
the purpose of obtaining a quorum.

Both abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, but broker
non-votes are not counted as shares entitled to vote so will not be counted towards the tabulation of votes cast on proposals
presented to shareholders.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What will happen if I abstain from voting or fail to vote on the proposals or fail to instruct my broker to vote on the
proposals?

A: If you indicate on your proxy that you abstain from voting on a proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote against the
Merger Proposal and against the Adjournment Proposal, as applicable. It will have the same effect as a vote against the Golden
Parachute Compensation Proposal if the proposal receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Ixia common
stock, present in person or represented by proxy and voting on the proposal, but such shares voting affirmatively do not also
constitute at least a majority of the required quorum for the meeting.

If you fail to cast your vote or fail to give voting instructions to your broker, bank, or nominee, it will have the same effect as a
vote against the Merger Proposal and will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal. It will have the same effect as a vote
against the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal if the proposal receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of
Ixia common stock, present in person or represented by proxy and voting on the proposal, but such shares voting affirmatively
do not also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum for the meeting.

Q: When should I submit my proxy?

A: You should submit your proxy as soon as possible so that your shares will be voted at the special meeting.

Q: Can I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy?

A: Yes. If you were a shareholder of record on the record date, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote, unless noted
below at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting. You can do this in one of following ways:

• delivering to our Corporate Secretary a signed written notice of revocation, bearing a date later than the date of the
proxy, stating that the proxy is revoked;

• signing and delivering a new paper proxy, relating to the same shares and bearing a later date than the original proxy;

• submitting another proxy by telephone or over the Internet by 1:00 a.m., CDT, on the date of the special meeting
(your latest telephone or Internet proxy submitted by such time will govern); or

• attending the special meeting and voting in person (although attendance at the special meeting will not, by itself,
revoke a proxy).

Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of Ixia proxies should be addressed to:

Ixia
26601 West Agoura Road
Calabasas, California 91302
Attention: Matthew S. Alexander, Corporate Secretary

If your shares are held in “street name,” you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank,
or other nominee. You must contact your broker, bank, or other nominee to find out how to do so. See above regarding how to
vote in person if your shares are held in street name.

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy
cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a
separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a holder of record and your
shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.

In order to ensure that all of your shares are voted at the special meeting, please complete, sign, date, and return each proxy
card and voting instruction card that you receive.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What rights will be available for dissenting shareholders?

A: Ixia shareholders who vote their shares of Ixia common stock “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal and who properly demand the
purchase of such shares in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL will not have those shares converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration otherwise payable for shares of Ixia common stock at the effective time. Those shares will
instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due pursuant to Chapter 13 of the
CGCL, which may ultimately be more than, less than, or equal to $19.65 per share. A copy of Chapter 13 of the CGCL is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. See “The Merger—Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 57 of this proxy
statement.

Q: Is the merger expected to be taxable to me?

A: The merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. holder (as defined in “The
Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 54 of this proxy statement) whose shares of
Ixia common stock are cancelled and converted into cash in the merger will recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received with respect to such shares (determined before the
deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and the holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares. A non-U.S. holder (as
defined in “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 54 of this proxy statement)
whose shares of Ixia common stock are cancelled and converted into cash in the merger will generally not be required to
recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes unless the non-U.S. holder has certain connections to the United
States.

You should read “The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 54 of this proxy
statement for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger.

Because individual circumstances may differ, you should consult your tax advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal,
state, local, and/or foreign tax consequences of the merger to you.

Q: Should I send in my stock certificate(s) now?

A: No. You will be sent a letter of transmittal after the completion of the merger describing how you may exchange your shares of
Ixia common stock for the merger consideration. If your shares are held in “street name” by your bank, brokerage firm, or other
nominee, you will receive instructions from your bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of
your “street name” shares of Ixia common stock in exchange for the merger consideration. Please do not send in your stock
certificate(s) now.

Q: What should I do if I have lost my stock certificate(s)?

A: If you have lost your stock certificate(s), please contact our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., at 1-800-962-
4284, to obtain replacement certificates. You may be required to sign an indemnity agreement and post a bond in respect of any
lost stock certificate(s).

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed?

A: If our shareholders do not approve the Merger Proposal or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, our shareholders
will not receive any payment for their shares of Ixia common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, we would remain an
independent public company, shares of Ixia common stock would continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ, and we would
continue to make annual, quarterly, and other filings with the SEC. Under specified circumstances, we may be required to pay
Keysight a termination fee of approximately $59.7 million as described in “The Merger Agreement— Transaction Expenses;
Termination Fees” beginning on page 76 of this proxy statement.

Q: What happens if I sell my shares of Ixia common stock before the special meeting?

A: The record date is earlier than the date of the special meeting and the date that the merger is expected to be completed. If you
transfer your shares of Ixia common stock after the record date, but before the special

meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the special meeting, but will transfer the right to receive the merger consideration
of $19.65 per share payable in cash, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes. The merger consideration is
payable only to those shareholders who hold their shares immediately prior to the effective time.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This proxy statement, the documents to which we refer you in this proxy statement, and information included in oral statements
or other written statements made or that may be made by us or on our behalf may include predictions, estimates, and other
information that may be considered “forward-looking statements” that do not directly or exclusively relate to historical facts,
including, without limitation, statements relating to the completion of the merger. You can typically identify forward-looking
statements by the use of forward-looking words, such as “may,” “should,” “could,” “project,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,”
“estimate,” “continue,” “potential,” “plan,” “forecast,” and other words of similar import. Shareholders are cautioned that any
forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. These statements are based on current expectations and
assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated as a result of
various factors.

These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors and matters described in this proxy statement and the
following factors: (1) the Company may be unable to obtain shareholder approval as required for the merger; (2) other conditions to
the closing of the merger may not be satisfied; (3) the merger may involve unexpected costs, liabilities, or delays; (4) the business of
the Company may suffer as a result of uncertainty surrounding the merger; (5) the outcome of any legal proceedings related to the
merger; (6) the Company may be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors; (7) the occurrence of
any event, change, or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement and, in certain cases, the
payment by us of a termination fee of approximately $59.7 million; (8) risks that the merger disrupts our current plans and
operations, results in potential difficulties in employee retention, diverts management’s or employees’ attention from ongoing
business operations; and (9) other risks to consummation of the merger, including the risk that the merger will not be consummated
within the expected time period or at all. Additional factors that may affect the future results of the Company are set forth in filings
the Company makes with the SEC from time to time, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2016, which is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date thereof.
Except as required by applicable law, Ixia undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or
circumstances after the date thereof.

agreement. Subsequent to signing the merger agreement, on February 2, 2017, Merger Sub, Keysight, and Ixia entered into a
joinder, pursuant to which Merger Sub agreed to be bound by the merger agreement and will be the Keysight subsidiary which will
merge with and into Ixia. If the merger is completed, Merger Sub will cease to exist by operation of law following its merger with
and into Ixia.

THE IXIA SPECIAL MEETING

General

Your proxy is solicited on behalf of the Ixia board for use at our special meeting of shareholders to be held on April 12, 2017,
at 9:00 a.m., local time, at the Sheraton Agoura Hills Hotel, located at 30100 Agoura Road, Agoura Hills, California 91301, or at
any continuation, postponement, or adjournment thereof, for the purposes discussed in this proxy statement and in the
accompanying Notice of Special Meeting and any other business as may properly come before the special meeting. Proxies are
solicited to give all shareholders of record an opportunity to vote on matters properly presented at the special meeting.

Date, Time, and Place of the Special Meeting

We will hold the special meeting on April 12, 2017, at 9:00 a.m., local time, at the Sheraton Agoura Hills Hotel, located at
30100 Agoura Road, Agoura Hills, California 91301. On or about March 15, 2017, we commenced mailing this proxy statement and
the enclosed form of proxy to our shareholders entitled to vote at our special meeting.

Purpose of the Special Meeting

At the special meeting, we are asking holders of record of Ixia common stock on March 13, 2017, to consider and vote on the
following:

1. the Merger Proposal;

2. the Adjournment Proposal; and

3. the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in “The Merger—
Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 52
of this proxy statement.

Recommendation of the Ixia Board

After careful consideration, the Ixia board has unanimously determined that the merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Ixia and its shareholders. After such consideration, the Ixia board
approved and declared advisable the merger agreement, the merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement in accordance with the requirements of the CGCL.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the Ixia board unanimously recommends that Ixia’s
shareholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal, and “FOR” the Golden Parachute
Compensation Proposal. See “The Merger—Recommendation of the Ixia Board; Reasons for the Merger” beginning on page
37 of this proxy statement for additional information.

Shareholders Entitled to Vote; Record Date

You may vote at the special meeting if you were a record holder of shares of Ixia common stock at the close of business on
March 13, 2017, the record date. For each share of Ixia common stock that you owned on the record date, you are entitled to cast
one vote on each matter voted upon at the special meeting. As of the record date, there were 83,201,627 shares of Ixia common
stock outstanding and entitled to vote.

Beneficial owners whose stock is held in street name will receive instructions for voting their shares from their broker, bank, or
other nominee, rather than from our proxy card.

Quorum and Vote Required

A quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold the special meeting. The required quorum for the transaction of business at the
special meeting will exist when the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Ixia common stock entitled to vote at the
special meeting are represented either in person or by proxy. If a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that the
special meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies. Abstentions and “broker non-votes,” discussed below, count as shares
present for establishing a quorum.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A “broker non-vote” occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner returns a valid proxy but does not vote on a
particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting authority and has not received instructions from the
beneficial owner of the shares. Brokers, banks, and other nominees will not have discretionary authority on the Merger Proposal, the
Adjournment Proposal, or the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal.

You may vote “FOR” or “AGAINST,” or you may “ABSTAIN” from voting on, the Merger Proposal. Approval of the Merger
Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total outstanding shares of Ixia common stock entitled to
vote at the special meeting. Because the vote on the Merger Proposal is based on the total number of shares outstanding, rather than
the number of actual votes cast, abstentions, and “broker non-votes” will have the same effect as voting against the approval of the
Merger Proposal.

You may vote “FOR” or “AGAINST,” or you may “ABSTAIN” from voting on, the Adjournment Proposal. The Adjournment
Proposal will be approved if a majority of the shares of Ixia common stock, present in person or represented by proxy and voting on
the proposal, vote in favor of the proposal, whether or not a quorum is present. Broker non-votes do not count as shares that are
entitled to vote so they will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal although abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
against that proposal.

You may vote “FOR” or “AGAINST,” or you may “ABSTAIN” from voting on, the Golden Parachute Compensation
Proposal. The non-binding, advisory Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal will be approved if the holders of a majority of the
shares of Ixia common stock, present in person or represented by proxy and voting on the proposal, vote in favor of the proposal,
provided such shares voting in favor of the proposal also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum for the meeting.
Broker non-votes do not count as shares that are entitled to vote so they will have no effect on whether the Golden Parachute
Compensation Proposal is approved by a majority of the votes cast on the proposal. Broker non-votes and abstentions will, however,
have the same effect as voting against the approval of the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal if the proposal is approved by a
majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and voting on the proposal, but the shares voting in favor of the
proposal do not constitute at least a majority of the required quorum for the meeting.

Shares Owned by Our Directors and Executive Officers

As of March 13, 2017, the record date, our directors and executive officers were entitled to vote approximately 18,592,392
shares of Ixia common stock, or approximately 22.3% of the total number of shares of Ixia common stock outstanding on that date.
These numbers do not give effect to outstanding Ixia stock options or Ixia RSUs, which do not represent shares entitled to vote at
the special meeting. In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, the Company and Keysight have entered into a
support agreement with each of (i) Laurent Asscher, a director, and (ii) Errol Ginsberg, the Chairman of the Ixia board and Chief
Innovation Officer, and related entities for whom they have shared voting power over shares of Ixia common stock owned by such
entities, obligating them to vote all of their and such entities’ shares of Ixia common stock in favor of the Merger Proposal and any
other proposals necessary to consummate the merger. For additional information regarding the support agreements, see “The Voting
and Support Agreements” beginning on page 78 of this proxy statement.

We currently expect that each of our directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposals to be
presented at the special meeting.

Voting; Proxies

You may vote in person or by proxy at the special meeting.

Voting in Person

If you plan to attend the special meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the special meeting. Please
note that admission to the special meeting is limited to Ixia’s shareholders or their representatives.

For holders of record of Ixia shares, upon your arrival at the meeting location, you will need to bring valid picture
identification to be admitted to the meeting. If you are a shareholder who is an individual, you will need

TABLE OF CONTENTS

to present government-issued identification showing your name and photograph (i.e., a driver’s license or passport), or, if you are
representing an institutional investor, you will need to present government-issued photo identification and professional evidence
showing your representative capacity for such entity. In each case, we will verify such documentation with our record date
shareholder list. We reserve the right to limit the number of representatives who may attend the special meeting. Cameras and
electronic recording devices will not be permitted at the special meeting.

Please note, however, that if your shares are held in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a broker,
bank, or other nominee, and you wish to vote at the special meeting, in addition to providing identification as outlined for record
holders above, you will need a legal proxy from your broker or a recent brokerage statement or letter from your broker reflecting
your stock ownership as of the record date. Otherwise, you will not be permitted to attend the special meeting. If your shares are
held in the name of a broker, you must obtain and bring to the special meeting a legal proxy issued in your name from the broker to
be able to vote at the special meeting.

Voting by Proxy

If you do not wish to attend the special meeting, you may submit your proxy by completing, dating, signing, and returning the
enclosed proxy card by mail or by granting a proxy by telephone or on the Internet. All shares of Ixia common stock represented by
properly executed proxies received in time for the special meeting will be voted at the special meeting in the manner specified by
the shareholders giving those proxies. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted “FOR” the
Merger Proposal, “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal, and “FOR” the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal.

If your shares are held in “street name,” which means your shares are held of record by a broker, bank, or other nominee, you
should instruct your broker, bank, or nominee how to vote your shares using the voting instruction form furnished by your broker,
bank, or nominee.

Only shares of Ixia common stock affirmatively voted for the Merger Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal, and the Golden
Parachute Compensation Proposal, and properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions, will be counted as votes
“FOR” the proposals. Shares of Ixia common stock held by persons who attend the special meeting but abstain from voting in
person or by proxy, and shares of Ixia common stock for which we received proxies directing an abstention, will have the same
effect as votes “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal (except for purposes of exercising your dissenters’ rights, in which case you must,
among other things, affirmatively vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal) and the Adjournment Proposal. Shares of Ixia common
stock represented by proxies that reflect a “broker non-vote” will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists,
and those shares will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal but, because broker non-votes are not counted
as shares entitled to vote, will have no effect on the Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same
effect as votes against the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal if the proposal is approved by the affirmative vote of a majority
of the shares of Ixia common stock, present in person or represented by proxy and voting on the proposal, but such shares voting in
favor of the proposal do not also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum for the meeting.

How Proxies Are Voted

If you complete and submit your proxy card or voting instructions, the persons named as proxies will follow your instructions.
If you are a shareholder of record and you submit a proxy card or voting instructions but do not direct how to vote on each item, the
persons named as proxies will vote in favor of the Merger Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal, and the Golden Parachute
Compensation Proposal.

Revocation of Proxy

If you are a shareholder of record, you may revoke your proxy, unless noted below, at any time before your proxy is voted at
the special meeting by taking any of the following actions:

• delivering to our Corporate Secretary a signed written notice of revocation, bearing a date later than the date of the proxy,
stating that the proxy is revoked;

• signing and delivering a new paper proxy, relating to the same shares and bearing a later date than the original proxy;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• submitting another proxy by telephone or over the Internet by 1:00 a.m., CDT, on the date of the special meeting (your
latest telephone or Internet proxy submitted by such time will govern); or

• attending the special meeting and voting in person (although attendance at the special meeting will not, by itself, revoke a
proxy).

Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of Ixia proxies should be addressed to:

Ixia
26601 West Agoura Road
Calabasas, California 91302
Attention: Matthew S. Alexander, Corporate Secretary

If your shares are held in “street name,” you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank,
or other nominee. You must contact your broker, bank, or other nominee to find out how to do so. See above regarding how to vote
in person if your shares are held in street name.

Please refer to the instructions on your proxy or voting instruction card to determine the deadlines for voting over the Internet
or by telephone. Please do not return your stock certificate(s) with your proxy card. When the merger is completed, a separate
letter of transmittal will be mailed to you that will enable you to receive the merger consideration in exchange for your stock
certificate(s).

If you vote by proxy, regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card, and each
of them, with full power of substitution, as your proxies, will vote your shares of Ixia common stock in the way that you indicate.
When completing the Internet or telephone processes or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares of Ixia common stock
should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some, or none of the specific items of business to come before the
special meeting.

It is important that you vote your shares of Ixia common stock promptly. Whether or not you plan to attend the special
meeting, please complete, date, sign, and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying
prepaid reply envelope, or submit your proxy by telephone or the Internet. If your shares are held in street name, please, as
promptly as possible, provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares in accordance
with the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank, or nominee.

Solicitation of Proxies

The Ixia board is soliciting proxies for the special meeting from the Ixia shareholders. We will bear the entire cost of soliciting
proxies from our shareholders. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by delivery of this proxy statement by mail, we will request
that brokers, banks, and other nominees that hold shares of Ixia common stock, which are beneficially owned by our shareholders,
send Notices of the Special Meeting, proxies, and proxy materials to those beneficial owners and secure those beneficial owners’
voting instructions. We will reimburse those record holders for their reasonable expenses. We have engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. to
assist in the solicitation of proxies and provide related advice and informational support for which we will pay a fee of $12,500 plus
reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses. We may also use several of our regular employees, who will not be specially
compensated, to solicit proxies from our shareholders, either personally or by telephone, Internet, facsimile, or special delivery
letter. In addition, Ixia and its directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from
Ixia’s shareholders in connection with the merger. The interests of Ixia’s directors and executive officers in connection with the
merger is discussed in more detail in “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on
page 49 of this proxy statement.

Dissenters’ Rights

Any holder of shares of Ixia common stock as of the record date may, by complying with the provisions of Chapter 13 of the
CGCL, require us to purchase such holder’s shares of Ixia common stock at their fair market value (as defined in “The Merger—
Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 57 of this proxy statement) in lieu of

receiving the merger consideration for their shares. The fair market value of such shares will be determined as of the day of, and
immediately prior to, the first announcement of the terms of the proposed merger (which occurred on the morning of January 30,
2017), excluding any appreciation or depreciation in consequence of the proposed merger.

Shareholders of Ixia common stock who vote their shares of Ixia common stock “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal and who
properly demand the purchase of such shares in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL will not have such shares converted into
the right to receive consideration otherwise payable to holders of Ixia common stock at the effective time, but such shares will
instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due pursuant to Chapter 13 of the
CGCL.

Under Chapter 13 of the CGCL, the shares of Ixia common stock must satisfy each of the following requirements to qualify as
dissenting shares: (i) such shares of Ixia common stock must have been outstanding on March 13, 2017, the record date for the
special meeting; (ii) such shares of Ixia common stock must have been voted “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal; (iii) the holder of
such shares of Ixia common stock must make a written demand that is received by us or our transfer agent no later than the date of
the special meeting that we purchase such Ixia common stock at the fair market value; (iv) the holder of such shares of Ixia common
stock must submit to Ixia or our transfer agent, (A) if the shares are certificated securities, the certificate(s) representing any shares
which the holder demands that Ixia purchase for endorsement, or (B) if the shares are uncertificated securities, written notice of the
number of shares which the holder demands that Ixia purchase, all in accordance with Section 1302 of the CGCL; and (v) the holder
of such shares of Ixia common stock must comply with the other provisions of Chapter 13 of the CGCL.

A vote “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal does not in and of itself constitute a demand for dissenting shareholder rights under
California law. Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Chapter 13 of the CGCL may result in the loss of a
shareholder’s statutory dissenters’ rights. A copy of Chapter 13 of the CGCL is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. Note
that it is not sufficient to abstain from voting or for your shares to be subject to a broker non-vote if you wish to exercise your
dissenters’ rights. See “The Merger—Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 57 of this proxy statement.

Adjournments or Postponements

Although it is not currently expected, the special meeting may be adjourned for the purpose of, among other things, soliciting
additional proxies, by the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Ixia common stock represented in person or by proxy at
the meeting, whether or not a quorum is present. Any signed proxies received by us for which no voting instructions are provided on
such matter will be voted “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

PROPOSAL 1
THE MERGER PROPOSAL

The Merger Proposal

Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, which is described in this proxy statement and attached as Annex
A, Ixia will be acquired by Keysight. We encourage you to carefully read the merger agreement in its entirety, which is the principal
document governing the merger.

The merger agreement provides that Merger Sub will be merged with and into Ixia, with Ixia continuing as the surviving
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Keysight. Upon the completion of the merger, each share of Ixia common stock
outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the merger (other than shares held by holders who have properly perfected
dissenters’ rights under Chapter 13 of the CGCL, a copy of which is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement, and shares owned
by Keysight or Merger Sub, or by any subsidiary of Keysight, Merger Sub, or Ixia), will be converted into the right to receive
$19.65 in cash per share, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

Completion of the merger is conditioned on, among other things, approval of the Merger Proposal.

Vote Required and Ixia Board Recommendation

The Merger Proposal will be approved if the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Ixia common stock vote in favor
of the proposal. If you are an Ixia shareholder and you abstain from voting or fail to vote, or fail to instruct your broker, bank, or
other nominee how to vote on the Merger Proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote cast “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal.

The Ixia board recommends a vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal.

PROPOSAL 2
AUTHORITY TO ADJOURN THE SPECIAL MEETING

The Adjournment Proposal

If at the special meeting, the Ixia board determines it is necessary or appropriate to adjourn the special meeting to a later date to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the Merger Proposal, then we
intend to move to vote on the Adjournment Proposal. In such case, we will ask our shareholders to vote only upon the Adjournment
Proposal and not the Merger Proposal or the Golden Parachute Proposal.

In this proposal, we are asking you to vote in favor of, and to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Ixia board to
vote in favor of, the Adjournment Proposal. If the shareholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn the special
meeting, and any adjourned session of the special meeting, and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including the
solicitation of proxies from shareholders that have previously voted. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal
could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the Merger Proposal to defeat
that proposal, we could adjourn the special meeting without a vote on the Merger Proposal and seek to convince the holders of those
shares to change their votes to votes in favor of the Merger Proposal.

Vote Required and Ixia Board Recommendation

The Adjournment Proposal will be approved if a majority of the shares of Ixia common stock, present in person or represented
by proxy and entitled to vote on the subject matter, vote in favor of the proposal, whether or not a quorum is present.

The Ixia board recommends that you vote “FOR” the Adjournment Proposal.

PROPOSAL 3
GOLDEN PARACHUTE COMPENSATION PROPOSAL

Advisory Vote Regarding the Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and Rule 14a-21(c) of the Exchange
Act, we are seeking non-binding, advisory shareholder approval of the compensation that will be paid or may become payable to our
named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed in “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 49 of this proxy statement. The proposal gives Ixia
shareholders the opportunity to express their views on the merger-related compensation of the named executive officers.
Accordingly, we are requesting shareholders to approve the following resolution, on a non-binding, advisory basis:

“RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Ixia approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that will
be paid or may become payable to Ixia’s named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed pursuant to
Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden
Parachute Compensation” beginning on page 49 of Ixia’s proxy statement for the special meeting.”

Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon Ixia, the Ixia board, the Compensation Committee, or Keysight.
Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to shareholder approval.
Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is consummated, our named executive officers may
become eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger in accordance with the terms and
conditions applicable to those payments as described in “The Merger—Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation.”

The vote on this non-binding, advisory Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on
the Merger Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal. Accordingly, you may vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal and the Adjournment
Proposal and vote “AGAINST” or “ABSTAIN” with respect to this Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal (and vice versa).

Vote Required and Ixia Board Recommendation

The Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal will be approved if a majority of the shares of Ixia common stock, present in
person or represented by proxy and voting on the proposal, vote in favor of the proposal, provided such shares voting in favor of the
proposal also constitute at least a majority of the required quorum for the meeting.

The Ixia board recommends that you vote “FOR” the non-binding, advisory Golden Parachute Compensation
Proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGER

This discussion of the merger does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger
agreement, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.
You should read the entire merger agreement carefully as it is the primary legal document that governs the merger.

Overview

Ixia is seeking the approval by its shareholders of the merger agreement Ixia entered into as of January 30, 2017, as may be
amended from time to time, with Keysight and, by a joinder dated February 2, 2017, Merger Sub. Pursuant to the merger agreement,
subject to the approval of the merger agreement and the principal terms of the merger by our shareholders and the satisfaction of
other conditions to the completion of the merger specified in the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Ixia,
with Ixia surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Keysight.

The Ixia board has unanimously approved the merger agreement, determined that the merger and the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Ixia’s shareholders, directed that the merger agreement
be submitted to Ixia’s shareholders for approval at a duly held meeting and resolved to recommend that Ixia’s shareholders vote in
favor of the Merger Proposal.

Upon consummation of the merger, each share of Ixia common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time (other than dissenting shares and shares owned by Keysight or Merger Sub, or by any subsidiary of Keysight, Merger Sub, or
Ixia (except to the extent held by any such person on behalf of a third party)) will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive the merger consideration of $19.65 per share in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes required by
law.

joinder, pursuant to which Merger Sub agreed to be bound by the merger agreement and will be the Keysight subsidiary which will
merge with and into Ixia. If the merger is completed, Merger Sub will cease to exist by operation of law following its merger with

Merger Consideration

At the effective time, each share of Ixia common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
(other than the excluded shares, which will be cancelled, and other than dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive
the merger consideration of $19.65 per share in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

Each share of Merger Sub common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be
converted into one share of common stock of the surviving corporation, and such converted shares will thereafter constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation.

Background of the Merger

The Ixia board and Ixia’s management regularly review Ixia’s operating and strategic plans, both near-term and long-term,
including potential strategic opportunities available to Ixia. As part of this ongoing process, the Ixia board and management have
periodically evaluated whether the continued execution of Ixia’s strategy and business plans as a standalone company or the sale of
Ixia to, or a combination of Ixia with, a third party offers the best avenue to maximize shareholder value. In connection with such
reviews, members of the Ixia board and management have met from time to time with various third parties who expressed an
interest in engaging in a strategic transaction with Ixia, and the Ixia board and management have from time to time engaged third
party advisors to assist in evaluating Ixia’s strategic alternatives. In addition, as part of the implementation of its plans, the Ixia
board has regularly evaluated the possible acquisition of companies or product lines in order to enhance the scope and nature of
Ixia’s product offerings and technology and add complementary businesses. Ixia completed four such acquisitions in the last five
fiscal years.

On August 16, 2016, Bethany Mayer, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Ixia, received a phone call from Ron
Nersesian, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Keysight, during which Mr. Nersesian expressed an interest in a strategic
transaction with Ixia and requested an opportunity to conduct due diligence in order to make a proposal. Mr. Nersesian also inquired
as to whether Ixia’s board might be interested in such a transaction. Ms. Mayer had previously met Mr. Nersesian at an investor
conference in Las Vegas on September 16, 2015. Ms. Mayer advised Mr. Nersesian that she would consult with the Ixia board. Ms.
Mayer and Matthew Alexander, the Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary of Ixia, notified the Ixia board
by email the same day and called a special meeting of the Ixia board. Mr. Alexander also consulted with a representative of Ixia’s
outside legal counsel, Bryan Cave LLP (“Bryan Cave”).

On August 17, 2016, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting at which Ms. Mayer briefed the Ixia board on her discussion
with Mr. Nersesian. The Ixia board discussed the appropriate response and strategy, and affirmed its desire to focus on Ixia’s current
business plan and operating objectives as opposed to a sale transaction. The Ixia board then instructed Ms. Mayer to consult with
legal counsel regarding an appropriate response to Keysight and to report back to the Ixia board after any further conversation with
Mr. Nersesian.

On August 18, 2016, Ms. Mayer had a further telephone conversation with Mr. Nersesian in which Ms. Mayer indicated that
Ixia was not seeking a sale at that time but was instead focused on pursuing its business and operating plans. She declined
Keysight’s request to conduct due diligence at that time. Ms. Mayer indicated that the Ixia board would review any proposal that
Keysight might put forward, but any proposal that provided only a customary premium over Ixia’s then-current stock price would
not be acceptable to the Ixia board. Mr. Nersesian advised Ms. Mayer that Keysight would continue to work on preparing a proposal
for an acquisition of Ixia, that the Keysight board of directors would be meeting in September, and that Keysight might make a
proposal after that meeting.

On August 19, 2016, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting. Ms. Mayer updated the Ixia board regarding her conversation
with Mr. Nersesian. The Ixia board discussed strategy and process regarding the evaluation and response to any proposal that
Keysight might make in the future. Mr. Alexander discussed with the Ixia board its fiduciary duties with regard to the evaluation of,
and any response to, any offer that Keysight might make.

On September 13, 2016, Ms. Mayer briefly met Mr. Nersesian in person while both were attending a business conference in
Las Vegas. At that time, Mr. Nersesian expressed continued interest on the part of Keysight in Ixia’s complementary products and
technology and informed Ms. Mayer that Keysight intended to

make a proposal to acquire Ixia. Ms. Mayer indicated again that the Ixia board would not be amenable to a customary premium over
Ixia’s then-current stock price. Mr. Nersesian also invited Ms. Mayer and Errol Ginsberg, Ixia’s Chairman and Chief Innovation
Officer, to visit Keysight’s offices in Santa Rosa, California in the coming weeks.

On September 27, 2016, Ms. Mayer and Mr. Nersesian, in response to Mr. Nersesian’s request for a meeting, scheduled an in-
person meeting to take place on September 29, 2016. On September 28, 2016, Ms. Mayer and Messrs. Ginsberg and Alexander met
with representatives of Bryan Cave to, among other things, discuss and prepare for the scheduled meeting with Mr. Nersesian.

On September 29, 2016, Ms. Mayer and Mr. Ginsberg met with Mr. Nersesian and Jay Alexander, Keysight’s Senior Vice
President and Chief Technology Officer, at Bryan Cave’s San Francisco office. During the meeting, Keysight submitted to Ixia a
written, non-binding proposal for Keysight to acquire Ixia at a purchase price of $16.00 per share in cash, and the proposal indicated
that Keysight could pay part of the consideration in Keysight stock if Ixia so preferred. Also on September 29, 2016, Matthew
Alexander circulated a copy of the proposal to the Ixia board and to representatives of Bryan Cave.

On September 30, 2016, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting at which the Ixia board discussed the previous day’s meeting,
the written proposal received from Keysight at that meeting, the strategy and process for evaluating and responding to that proposal,
the need to engage a financial advisor to assist in such evaluation, the process for potentially seeking other proposals, and related
matters. Representatives from Bryan Cave attended a portion of the meeting and discussed with the Ixia board its fiduciary duties
and responsibilities in connection with the proposal and possible next steps. The Ixia board determined to engage a financial advisor
and agreed to solicit proposals and hear presentations from Deutsche Bank and Bank A. The Ixia board discussed whether to launch
a full sale process, including a public announcement, or whether to conduct a more limited and confidential process to gauge
potential market interest and evaluate the Keysight proposal. The Ixia board considered the significant risks to Ixia and to its
prospects, competitive position, and operations that would arise from a public announcement of a sale process and that would likely
arise if any such process were not kept confidential. The Ixia board balanced this risk against the potential benefits of an expansive
auction process. The Ixia board also considered the fact that it had not determined that it would be in the best interests of Ixia
shareholders to engage in a sale transaction at this time and therefore any public process would be premature. The Ixia board
weighed these risks and potential benefits and concluded the Ixia board would seek further advice of counsel and the advice of
financial advisors before making any decision.

From September 30, 2016 through October 3, 2016, Ixia communicated with representatives of Deutsche Bank and Bank A,
requesting each of them to make a presentation to the Ixia board regarding a possible engagement to act as Ixia’s financial advisor to
assist in evaluating the unsolicited proposal from Keysight and other strategic alternatives. On October 3, 2016, the Ixia board held
a telephonic meeting, along with representatives from Bryan Cave, to receive and discuss information from each of Deutsche Bank
and Bank A. Representatives of each of the banks discussed their preliminary views regarding the unsolicited proposal from
Keysight and the process for evaluating the proposal and other strategic alternatives. Each made suggestions as to potential parties
who might be viable candidates with respect to a potential transaction with Ixia, and who Ixia could approach to seek additional
proposals, including both potential strategic and potential financial sponsor acquirers. After the presentations and discussions, the
Ixia board determined to meet the following day to discuss the issues further and to make a determination as to which of the two
banks should be retained to act as Ixia’s financial advisor.

On October 4, 2016, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, along with representatives from Bryan Cave, at which the
possible engagement of Deutsche Bank or Bank A was discussed. The Ixia board discussed, among other things, the relationships
that Deutsche Bank had with Keysight. The Ixia board approved the engagement of Deutsche Bank, subject to negotiation of an
appropriate engagement letter and written confirmation from Deutsche Bank of the extent of its prior work with Keysight.

On October 5, 2016, Ms. Mayer had a telephone conversation with Mr. Nersesian in which Ms. Mayer conveyed to Mr.
Nersesian that Keysight’s offer had been shared with the Ixia board and that Ixia intended to engage a financial advisor.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On October 7, 2016, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, with Bryan Cave representatives present, at which the Ixia board
further discussed the engagement of Deutsche Bank. The Ixia board reviewed and discussed a draft of the engagement letter and
also reviewed and discussed the relationship that Deutsche Bank had with Keysight, including but not limited to the fact and extent
of the participation by an affiliate of Deutsche Bank in an existing Keysight credit facility.

During the period from October 4 to November 7, 2016, Deutsche Bank worked with Ixia management to prepare preliminary
financial analyses of the unsolicited proposal from Keysight and various potential strategic alternatives, based initially on publicly
available information and later based on financial plans prepared by Ixia management.

On October 8, 2016, the Ixia board held a further meeting, with Bryan Cave representatives present, at which the Ixia board
further discussed the engagement of Deutsche Bank and approved the proposed engagement letter with Deutsche Bank. Ixia and
Deutsche Bank thereafter entered into an engagement letter dated as of October 10, 2016. Following the approval of the proposed
engagement letter, representatives from Deutsche Bank joined the board meeting. The Ixia board discussed the appropriate response
to be given to Keysight regarding its unsolicited proposal, the process and timing for Deutsche Bank to prepare its preliminary
financial analysis of the unsolicited proposal from Keysight, the scope of market inquiry necessary and appropriate to assure that the
Ixia board would be able to consider all viable alternatives, and the need to maintain confidentiality in order to protect the ongoing
operations and competitive position of Ixia. The Ixia board affirmed that it had not determined to pursue the sale of Ixia, but that a
sale remained one of a number of possible strategic alternatives. The Ixia board discussed the need to approach other parties in order
to evaluate fully, and respond to, the unsolicited proposal from Keysight. The Ixia board discussed a list presented by Deutsche
Bank of particular parties who might be approached to gauge their interest in pursuing a strategic transaction with Ixia, based on
financial ability, familiarity with the industry in which Ixia operates, likelihood of having an interest in pursuing a strategic
transaction, and ability to close. The Ixia board approved, on a preliminary basis, in addition to Keysight, 11 parties, including eight
potential financial sponsor acquirers and three potential strategic acquirers, as potential bidders to be contacted by Deutsche Bank.
One of the parties on the list to be contacted was Party A, a strategic acquirer, and another was Party B, a financial sponsor acquirer.

On October 10, 2016, Ms. Mayer had a telephone conversation with Mr. Nersesian in which Ms. Mayer advised him that Ixia
had engaged Deutsche Bank as its financial advisor to assist the Ixia board in evaluating Keysight’s proposal. Ms. Mayer also
advised Mr. Nersesian that Keysight would need to materially increase its proposed price for Keysight’s proposal to be considered
by the Ixia board, and that Ixia was prepared to enter into a non-disclosure agreement (an “NDA”) with Keysight and permit
Keysight to engage in due diligence so that it would have further information on which to base a revised proposal, should it wish to
do so. In that call, Mr. Nersesian did not commit to making a revised proposal, entering into an NDA, or conducting due diligence or
further negotiations.

On October 13, 2016, the Chief Executive Officer of Party A contacted one of Ixia’s directors and asked for contact
information for Mr. Ginsberg. Party A’s Chief Executive Officer then attempted to contact Mr. Ginsberg telephonically and via a text
message, and left messages for Mr. Ginsberg. Also on October 13, 2016, a member of the Board of Directors of Party A contacted a
representative of Deutsche Bank by email, stating that he understood that Ixia was engaging in a sale process and that Deutsche
Bank was running the process, and asking to have a conversation. Based on instructions from Ixia management, the representative
of Deutsche Bank did not respond to that email.

On October 14, 2016, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from Deutsche Bank and Bryan Cave
present. Ms. Mayer and Mr. Ginsberg reported the contacts from Party A. The Ixia board and Ixia’s advisors discussed the contacts
and the appropriate response. Deutsche Bank reviewed certain information regarding Party A and its financial ability to consummate
a transaction. The Ixia board affirmed that it had not determined to sell Ixia and Ixia was not engaged in a sale process at that time.
The Ixia board authorized Mr. Ginsberg to respond to the messages from Party A’s Chief Executive Officer and advise the individual
that Ixia was not seeking a sale, but that should this change Ixia would contact Party A and ask it to participate in any future
process. The Ixia board and representatives of Deutsche Bank also discussed the ongoing work of Deutsche Bank, with the
assistance of Ixia management, to prepare a preliminary financial analysis relating to Ixia.

Later in the day on October 14, 2016, Mr. Ginsberg contacted Party A’s Chief Executive Officer to relay the messages as
instructed by the Ixia board.

On October 21, 2016, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from Bryan Cave present. Representatives
from Bryan Cave made a presentation and led a discussion regarding the Ixia board’s fiduciary duties in the context of its receipt of
an unsolicited proposal. The Ixia board reviewed the ongoing work by Ixia management with Deutsche Bank to enable Deutsche
Bank to prepare a preliminary financial analysis of Ixia based on confidential company information and management forecasts. The
Ixia board also discussed further the timing of contact with other potential bidders and the selection of those potential bidders. The
Ixia board determined to wait until there had been further substantive contact with Keysight before determining whether to contact
other potential bidders.

On October 31, 2016, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, with Ixia management and representatives from Deutsche Bank
and Bryan Cave present. During the meeting, representatives of Deutsche Bank reviewed with the Ixia board a preliminary financial
analysis of Ixia, based on publicly available information. The Ixia board reviewed and discussed with Ixia management ongoing
efforts by Ixia management to develop a forward-looking multi-year financial model that would serve as the basis for an updated
financial analysis of Ixia by Deutsche Bank. The Ixia board and Ixia’s advisors also discussed possible further communications with
Keysight and possible outreach to other potential bidders, with the goal of contacting credible and viable potential bidders while
maintaining confidentiality.

On November 1, 2016, Ixia issued its earnings release reporting its financial results for its third quarter ended September 30,
2016. Later that day, Ixia hosted a conference call regarding its earnings report.

On November 4, 2016, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, with Bryan Cave representatives present. Ixia management
presented to the Ixia board a preliminary multi-year financial plan for the Ixia board’s consideration. After review and discussion of
the Ixia management presentation and Deutsche Bank’s financial analysis, which had been based on publicly available information
and reviewed at the October 31, 2016 board meeting, the Ixia board instructed Ixia management to provide the preliminary financial
plan to Deutsche Bank for its use in completing an updated financial analysis of Ixia. The Ixia board also discussed the scope of any
process that Ixia might undertake to further evaluate the proposal from Keysight and to determine market interest. The Ixia board
again balanced the negative consequences from a public sale process against the possible benefits and the fact that the Ixia board
had not determined to seek a sale of Ixia. The Ixia board again concluded that no third parties should be contacted until there was a
further substantive discussion with Keysight, and that any process should be targeted to viable and credible parties with a likely
interest in engaging in a transaction and should be kept confidential.

On November 7, 2016, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from Deutsche Bank and Bryan Cave
present. During the meeting, representatives of Deutsche Bank reviewed with the Ixia board an updated financial analysis based on
Ixia management’s three-year financial plan for 2017, 2018, and 2019 as well as estimates for 2020 and 2021 calculated by
Deutsche Bank based on guidance provided by Ixia’s management and approved for Deutsche Bank’s use by the Ixia board. The
Ixia board and Ixia’s advisors discussed the updated analysis and various potential strategic alternatives that might be available to
Ixia. The Ixia board also discussed a meeting that, prior to the time Deutsche Bank had been engaged by Ixia, had been scheduled to
take place on November 8, 2016 between representatives from Deutsche Bank and Mr. Nersesian, Neil Dougherty, Chief Financial
Officer of Keysight, and Jeff Henderson, Vice President, Corporate Development, of Keysight, and agreed upon a script for the
meeting. The Ixia board and advisors discussed appropriate next steps, confirmed preliminary approval of a list of 11 potential
bidders (including Party A, two other strategic parties, and eight financial sponsor parties, including Party B) to be contacted should
Keysight express an interest in further negotiations, and discussed and agreed upon a script for Deutsche Bank in making any such
contacts.

On November 8, 2016, representatives from Deutsche Bank and Mr. Nersesian participated in a telephone conference in which
representatives from Deutsche Bank advised Mr. Nersesian that the price in Keysight’s unsolicited proposal was insufficient and that
Ixia would not be making a counter-offer. Representatives from Deutsche Bank further informed Mr. Nersesian that Ixia remained
interested in discussing a business combination

if the parties executed an NDA to enable Keysight to materially improve its proposal. Representatives from Deutsche Bank also
informed Mr. Nersesian that Ixia had received other unsolicited interest regarding a potential transaction. Mr. Nersesian expressed
interest in moving forward with negotiations, entering into an NDA, and conducting due diligence.

On November 9, 2016, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from Deutsche Bank and Bryan Cave
present. Representatives from Deutsche Bank reported on their conversation with Mr. Nersesian the previous day and his indication
of interest in moving forward with an NDA and due diligence and the possibility of an improved proposal. The Ixia board instructed
representatives from Deutsche Bank to contact Keysight’s financial advisor, Goldman, Sachs & Co. (“Goldman Sachs”), to arrange
for the negotiation and execution of an NDA and to arrange for due diligence. The Ixia board also reviewed the list of other
potential bidders and authorized Deutsche Bank to contact the 11 other previously approved parties to gauge their interest in a
potential transaction. The Ixia board confirmed that it had not affirmatively determined to sell Ixia at this time but was engaged in a
process of evaluating the non-binding proposal from Keysight and exploring the viability of strategic alternatives to that proposal.

On November 9 and November 10, 2016, representatives from Deutsche Bank approached eight potential financial sponsor
acquirers, including Party B, and three potential strategic acquirers, including Party A, to gauge potential interest in exploring a
strategic transaction with Ixia.

On November 11, 2016, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from Deutsche Bank and Bryan Cave
present. Representatives of Deutsche Bank reported on their contacts with the initial 11 identified potential bidders and Keysight
and reviewed the feedback from such bidders to date. They reported that Party A had indicated that it wanted to team with one of
the potential financial sponsor acquirers previously approved by the Ixia board, which teaming the Ixia board approved shortly
thereafter to enable Party A to maximize the price it would be able to pay.

During the period from November 16 to November 29, 2016, Ixia entered into NDAs with a total of seven potential bidders,
including Keysight, Party A, and the potential financial sponsor acquirer that had teamed with Party A, and Party B, all of which
contained standstill provisions. Each standstill provision permitted the potential bidder to communicate exclusively with the Ixia
board with respect to a transaction involving Ixia or to seek a waiver of such standstill provisions. The other five parties contacted
by Deutsche Bank expressed no interest in pursuing a transaction. The parties that entered into NDAs included five potential
financial sponsor acquirers and two potential strategic acquirers, including Keysight and Party A. During the period from November
17 through November 30, 2016, the seven potential bidders who had executed NDAs participated in meetings with Ixia
management, which were also attended by representatives of Deutsche Bank.

On November 18, 2016, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from Deutsche Bank and Bryan Cave
present. During the meeting, Ms. Mayer and representatives of Deutsche Bank reported on the status of the due diligence process,
communications with potential bidders, and a possible timeline for a potential sale process. The Ixia board directed Deutsche Bank
to add an additional strategic party to the list of potential bidders and to contact such additional party. However, this additional party
did not express any interest in a transaction with Ixia.

Following the Ixia management presentation meetings, three of the potential bidders who had executed NDAs and participated
in the Ixia management meetings indicated that they were not interested in moving forward in the process.

On November 30, 2016, Deutsche Bank distributed process letters to Keysight, Party A, Party B, and three other potential
bidders, in which the potential bidders were advised to submit, by December 13, 2016, preliminary proposals for the acquisition of
Ixia.

On December 1, 2016, the Ixia board held an in-person meeting at Ixia’s offices, with representatives from Deutsche Bank and
Bryan Cave present, at which representatives of Deutsche Bank provided to the Ixia board an update on the status of the process and
summary of conversations to date with potential bidders. Representatives from Bryan Cave delivered a presentation and led a
discussion regarding the Ixia board’s fiduciary duties in the context of a potential sale of the Company and various customary terms
of a merger agreement and related

agreements should a transaction take place. Also on December 1, 2016, a representative of Deutsche Bank received an inquiry from
another potential financial sponsor acquirer inquiring about whether Ixia had undertaken a sale process but which subsequently
determined it did not have a strong interest in a potential transaction.

On December 2, 2016, representatives from Ixia and Deutsche Bank received communications advising Ixia and Deutsche
Bank that a reporter at Reuters had been contacting various persons regarding a rumor that Ixia was engaged in a sale process. The
reporter also contacted Ixia and Deutsche Bank. Neither Ixia nor Deutsche Bank responded to the reporter, and Ixia did not provide
any comment for inclusion in the article. Ixia engaged communication consultants to provide advice and expertise regarding any
responses to inquiries that might arise by reason of any news reports. On December 2, 2016, Reuters published a news article stating
that Ixia was “exploring a potential sale.”

Immediately prior to and during the period following the publication of the report on December 2, 2016, Ixia or Deutsche Bank
was contacted by seven additional parties, including Party C, with requests to participate in any potential sale process, all of whom
were potential financial sponsor acquirers. The Ixia board, Ixia management, and representatives from Deutsche Bank and Bryan
Cave reviewed the inquiries, discussed appropriate responses, and determined that Deutsche Bank should contact two of the parties,
including Party C, and invite them to execute NDAs and consider proposing a transaction. The remaining five potential financial
sponsor acquirers who had made inquiries at or after the Reuters report were not invited to participate based on assessments of their
financial condition, actual interest in pursuing a transaction, ability to pursue and complete a transaction on a timely basis, and the
need to maintain confidentiality to protect Ixia. On December 6 and December 13, 2016, Ixia entered into NDAs with Party C and
the other additional potential bidder, each containing standstill provisions. Each standstill provision permitted the potential bidder to
communicate exclusively with the Ixia board with respect to a transaction involving Ixia or to seek a waiver of such standstill
provisions.

On December 7, 2016, Deutsche Bank delivered a process letter to Party C requesting a preliminary proposal by December 13,
2016. The other party who had been invited to participate had a meeting with Ixia management on December 14, 2016, after
execution of an NDA. Deutsche Bank delivered a process letter to such party requesting a proposal by December 15, 2016. The
party did not make a proposal and elected not to move forward.

On December 9, 2016, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from Deutsche Bank and Bryan Cave
present, at which representatives of Deutsche Bank reported to the Ixia board on the status of the process and reviewed certain
market and financial information.

On December 13, 2016, Ixia received preliminary proposals from four potential bidders: Keysight, Party A, Party B, and Party
C. The bid from Keysight was $17.00 per share, payable in cash and Keysight stock; the bid from Party A was a range of $16.50 to
$17.00 per share, also in cash and Party A stock; the bid from Party B was a range of $16.00 to $16.50 per share, all cash; and the
bid from Party C was $18.00 per share, all cash. The bid from Party A was accompanied by a “highly confident” letter from a
financing source regarding any financing that might be required.

On December 14, 2016, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from Deutsche Bank and Bryan Cave
present, at which they reviewed the four bid proposals. Representatives of Deutsche Bank presented a summary of the four
proposals, and the Ixia board engaged in a discussion with Ixia’s advisors regarding the proposals and next steps. The Ixia board
also discussed whether to admit any additional parties into the sale process, but determined not to do so based on the potential
additional parties’ financial ability to engage in a strategic transaction, likelihood of having an interest in pursuing a strategic
transaction, and ability to close. Following the meeting, Deutsche Bank informed Goldman Sachs that Ixia had received a higher all-
cash offer from another bidder.

During the period from December 15, 2016 through January 24, 2017, Deutsche Bank coordinated additional due diligence
meetings with Ixia management and representatives of Keysight, Party A, Party B, and Party C. During the period from December
20 to December 22, 2016, Ixia made available to Keysight, Party A, Party B, and Party C access to a virtual data room to enable
them to engage in further detailed due diligence. Additional items were posted to the virtual data room thereafter through January
28, 2017.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On January 4, 2017, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from Deutsche Bank and Bryan Cave
present, at which representatives of Bryan Cave reviewed with the Ixia board the form of merger agreement proposed to be made
available to bidders for review and comment as part of the bid process. After discussion, the Ixia board approved the form and
instructed Bryan Cave to post it in the virtual data room. Representatives of Deutsche Bank reviewed, and the Ixia board discussed,
the status of the process and the terms of a process letter to be sent to the four bidders.

On January 5, 2017, Deutsche Bank distributed process letters to Keysight, Party A, Party B, and Party C, indicating that final
bids, along with a mark-up of the merger agreement and evidence of availability of financing, were due on January 24, 2017. On
January 6, 2017, a draft merger agreement prepared by Bryan Cave was uploaded to the virtual data room.

On January 11, 2017, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from Deutsche Bank and Bryan Cave
present, at which representatives of Deutsche Bank and Ixia management reported to the Ixia board the process to date and the status
and extent of the due diligence activities of the four bidders. Following the meeting, Keysight was again informed that Ixia preferred
an all-cash transaction.

Between January 11 and January 24, 2017, Ixia management, with assistance from representatives of Deutsche Bank,
participated in several telephonic and in-person meetings with representatives of Keysight, Party A, Party B, and Party C to provide
additional due diligence information.

On January 24, 2017, each of Keysight, Party A, Party B, and Party C submitted final offers. The offer letters from Keysight
and Party A included as part of their bid package a mark-up to the draft merger agreement that had been posted in the virtual data
room. Party B and Party C did not submit mark-ups of the draft merger agreement. The bid from Keysight was $17.55 per share,
composed of cash and Keysight stock; the bid from Party A was $18.50 per share, all cash; the bid from Party B was $16.50 per
share, all cash; and the bid from Party C was $16.25 per share, all cash. The bid package from Keysight also contained a form of
commitment letter for financing necessary to consummate the transaction and a form of voting agreement proposed to be entered
into with certain significant Ixia shareholders. The bid package from Party A also included drafts of commitment letters from debt
financing sources, a negotiated form of investment agreement for convertible debt to be purchased by the financial sponsor who had
participated in the process alongside Party A, and a form of voting agreement proposed to be entered into with certain Ixia
shareholders. Keysight and Party A each indicated that its bid was subject only to confirmatory due diligence and completion of
definitive documentation.

On January 26, 2017, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from Deutsche Bank and Bryan Cave
present, at which the Ixia board reviewed the bid proposals received from each of Keysight, Party A, Party B, and Party C. The Ixia
board and representatives of Deutsche Bank discussed the financial aspects of the proposals, including the proposal from Keysight
to provide for consideration in the form of Keysight stock and cash. Representatives from Bryan Cave presented to the Ixia board a
legal analysis of the significant issues raised in the mark-ups of the draft merger agreement and forms of voting agreements
provided by Keysight and Party A, the significant differences between the two merger agreement mark-ups received, and certain
legal issues to be addressed in connection with any signing and closing of a transaction. The Ixia board instructed Bryan Cave to
send a revised draft of the merger agreement to Party A’s outside legal counsel and to negotiate the merger agreement and ancillary
documents. The Ixia board also instructed Bryan Cave to prepare and send to Keysight’s outside legal counsel, Cleary Gottlieb
Steen & Hamilton LLP (“Cleary Gottlieb”), a list of significant legal issues for discussion regarding Keysight’s mark-up of the draft
merger agreement and form of voting agreement, and to begin negotiations regarding these issues. The Ixia board determined not to
pursue negotiations with Party B or Party C at that time, based, among other factors, on price offered. At the meeting, the Ixia board
also instructed Ms. Mayer to contact Mr. Nersesian to advise him that the Company received an all-cash offer from another bidder at
a price that was materially higher than what Keysight offered, and to suggest that Keysight would need to significantly increase its
bid and propose an all-cash transaction to remain competitive. Following the meeting, Ms. Mayer contacted Mr. Nersesian by phone
and communicated to him as instructed by the Ixia board. On that call, Mr. Nersesian expressed continued interest in pursuing the
transaction. Later on the same day, Mr. Nersesian contacted Ms. Mayer by phone and indicated that Keysight anticipated holding a
meeting of its board of directors on January 28, 2017, and that he anticipated Keysight making an all-cash offer at a price that was
higher than their prior bid following such board meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On January 26, 2017, following the Ixia board meeting, Bryan Cave sent an issues list to Cleary Gottlieb, and on January 27,
2017, representatives of Bryan Cave and Cleary Gottlieb reviewed and discussed the issues identified in the list and certain other
issues arising out of the mark-up of the draft merger agreement and the form of voting agreement submitted by Keysight.

In its proposal letter, Party A indicated a desire to sign and announce a transaction on or before January 31, 2017. Over the
course of January 27 and 28, 2017, Party A and Ixia agreed on the desirability of signing and announcing a transaction before the
market opened on January 30, 2017, and established this as a goal. Early in the morning of January 27, 2017, Bryan Cave sent a
revised draft of the merger agreement to outside legal counsel to Party A, and over the course of January 27 and January 28, 2017,
negotiated with outside legal counsel to Party A the merger agreement, voting agreement, commitment letter, and investment
agreement.

On January 27, 2017, at Keysight’s request, representatives of Deutsche Bank and Ixia management, on a conference call with
representatives of Keysight, reviewed recent financial results of Ixia. Also on January 27 and January 28, 2017, Ixia management
and representatives of Deutsche Bank continued to arrange for Ixia management meetings to provide Keysight and Party A with
additional due diligence information.

On January 28, 2017, Keysight submitted to Ixia and Deutsche Bank a revised bid of $19.65 per share, all cash. The proposal
letter was accompanied by a commitment letter for the financing required to consummate the transaction and revised drafts of the
merger agreement and voting agreement. Following receipt of the revised bid from Keysight, on January 28, 2017, the Ixia board
held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from Deutsche Bank and Bryan Cave present. Representatives from Bryan Cave
reviewed with the Ixia board, and the Ixia board discussed, its fiduciary duties in the context of a potential sale of Ixia. The Ixia
board reviewed the proposal from Keysight and instructed Bryan Cave to prepare and send a revised draft of the merger agreement
to Cleary Gottlieb and to negotiate the merger agreement, voting agreement, and commitment letter. The Ixia board also instructed
representatives of Deutsche Bank to contact the Chief Executive Officer of Party A to advise him that an all-cash bid materially
higher than that of Party A had been received, and to invite Party A to increase its bid if it wanted to move forward in the process.
The Ixia board also reaffirmed its desire to sign and announce a transaction before the market opened on January 30, 2017, and
asked Deutsche Bank to confirm with Goldman Sachs the ability of Keysight to meet this target.

Next on January 28, 2017, representatives from Deutsche Bank contacted the Chief Executive Officer of Party A and indicated
the need for Party A to improve its proposal materially to be competitive. The Chief Executive Officer of Party A advised that it was
unlikely that Party A would be able to increase its bid.

Also on January 28, 2017, Deutsche Bank contacted Goldman Sachs to confirm that Keysight could meet the goal of signing
and announcing a transaction before the market opened on January 30, 2017. Goldman Sachs confirmed that Keysight could meet
this goal, and representatives of Deutsche Bank advised Goldman Sachs that Ixia would be moving forward with Keysight at that
time.

On January 27 and January 28, 2017, Bryan Cave reviewed the proposed voting agreements from Keysight and Party A with
legal counsel to the respective shareholders.

On January 28, 2017, Bryan Cave submitted revised drafts of the merger agreement and voting agreement to Cleary Gottlieb,
and representatives from Bryan Cave and Deutsche Bank thereafter engaged in ongoing negotiations with Cleary Gottlieb and
Goldman Sachs, respectively, through January 29, 2017 with respect to the drafts of the merger agreement, voting agreement, and
commitment letter.

During the evening of January 29, 2017, the Ixia board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from Bryan Cave and
Deutsche Bank present. A detailed summary regarding the final terms of the merger agreement, the bridge commitment letter, and
the voting agreements were distributed to the Ixia board in advance of the meeting. Representatives from Bryan Cave reported to the
Ixia board that substantial progress had been made in negotiations with Keysight and Cleary Gottlieb and that all material issues had
been resolved, but that transaction documents were not yet final. Representatives from Bryan Cave then reviewed the Ixia board’s
fiduciary duties in connection with the potential sale of Ixia. Representatives of Deutsche Bank then reviewed and discussed with
the Ixia board certain financial analysis with respect to the consideration of $19.65 per share of Ixia common stock and rendered an
oral opinion to the Ixia board, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated January 30, 2017, to the effect that, as of the date of
such opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations,
qualifications, and conditions on the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

review undertaken in connection therewith, as described in Deutsche Bank’s opinion, the consideration of $19.65 in cash per share
of Ixia common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Ixia common stock other than Keysight and its
affiliates. Representatives from Bryan Cave then presented a detailed summary regarding the final terms of the merger agreement,
the bridge commitment letter, and the voting agreements, and the Ixia board engaged in a discussion with representatives from
Bryan Cave and Deutsche Bank regarding these terms. The Ixia board considered various reasons to approve and recommend the
merger agreement, the merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement for approval by Ixia shareholders,
including certain countervailing factors, all as described below under the heading “—Recommendation of the Ixia Board; Reasons
for the Merger.” After discussions with Ixia’s financial and legal advisors, and in light of the reasons considered, the Ixia board
unanimously: (i) determined that it is in the best interests of Ixia and its shareholders to enter into, and approved, declared advisable,
and resolved to recommend the merger agreement (subject to the resolution of certain minor contractual provisions), (ii) approved
the execution, delivery, and performance by Ixia of the merger agreement and related agreements and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, and (iii) upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement, resolved to recommend that Ixia’s shareholders vote in favor of the merger agreement and the principal terms of the
merger.

During the night of January 29, 2017 and on January 30, 2017, Bryan Cave and Cleary Gottlieb continued to discuss the
merger agreement and resolved the final unresolved provisions of the merger agreement to the satisfaction of their respective clients.

On January 30, 2017, Keysight delivered a copy of an executed financing commitment letter to Ixia, and Keysight and Ixia
executed the merger agreement and voting agreements. At 6:45 a.m., Eastern time, on January 30, 2017, the parties issued a joint
press release announcing the transaction.

On February 1, 2017, Keysight Acquisition, Inc., a California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Keysight was
incorporated. On February 2, 2017, Keysight Acquisition Inc., Keysight and Ixia entered into a joinder, pursuant to which Keysight
Acquisition Inc. agreed to be bound by the merger agreement and will be the Keysight subsidiary which will merge with and into
Ixia.

On February 3, 2017, representatives of Keysight contacted representatives of an affiliate of Deutsche Bank to request that
such Deutsche Bank affiliate consent to an amendment to Keysight’s revolving credit facility which would not result in an increase
in such affiliate’s commitment thereunder. Deutsche Bank’s outside legal counsel advised Bryan Cave regarding this request on
February 7, 2017, and asked Bryan Cave to confirm whether or not Ixia would consent to the Deutsche Bank affiliate’s participation
in Keysight’s amended revolving credit facility. After the Ixia board was polled, such consent was provided on February 9, 2017.

Recommendation of the Ixia Board; Reasons for the Merger

Recommendation of the Ixia Board

The Ixia board has unanimously determined that the merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement, is fair to, and in the best interests of, Ixia and its shareholders, and approved and declared advisable the merger
agreement and the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Accordingly, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, the Ixia board unanimously recommends
that our shareholders vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal.

Reasons for the Merger

In reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement, the merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement and, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, to recommend that Ixia’s shareholders approve the
Merger Proposal, the Ixia board, with the assistance of Ixia’s management and advisors, considered other alternative transactions,
including contacts and extensive discussions with other potential acquirers. Notwithstanding the process described above, no other
potential acquirer offered an alternative as favorable to Ixia’s shareholders as the merger with Keysight.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Ixia board considered a number of positive factors in its deliberations, including the following (not in any relative order of
importance):

• The merger consideration consists solely of cash, providing immediate liquidity and certainty of value to Ixia’s
shareholders, which the Ixia board believed was compelling compared to the long-term value creation potential of Ixia’s
business taking into account the risks of remaining independent and pursuing Ixia’s current business and financial plans.

• The merger consideration represents a premium of (i) approximately 45% to Ixia’s unaffected closing stock price on
December 1, 2016, the last trading day prior to media reports that Ixia was considering strategic alternatives, (ii)
approximately 38% to Ixia’s unaffected 52-week high closing stock price for the period ended December 1, 2016, and (iii)
approximately 8% over the closing price of Ixia common stock on January 27, 2017, the last completed trading day prior
to the announcement that it entered into the merger agreement.

• The Ixia board believes that the merger consideration represents full and fair value for the shares of Ixia common stock,
taking into account the auction process that Ixia followed prior to signing the merger agreement and the Ixia board’s
familiarity with Ixia’s business strategy, assets, and prospects, and the relative certainty of the consideration in cash as
compared to uncertainty of realizing any forecasted financial results.

• The Ixia board believes that the merger consideration represents the highest consideration that Keysight was willing to pay
and the highest per share value reasonably obtainable for Ixia’s shareholders, in each case, as of the date of the merger
agreement, which belief was based on a number of factors, including the fact that this price represented a significant
increase from the $16.00 price initially proposed by Keysight.

• The merger is subject to the approval of Ixia shareholders, and the shareholders are free to reject the merger.

• The network test and monitoring and network security industries and target markets in which Ixia competes are intensely
competitive.

• There are trends toward consolidation within Ixia’s industries, scale is important in a competitive market environment, and
thus there are major challenges to growth as a smaller independent publicly traded company.

• There are general risks and market conditions that could affect the price of the Ixia common stock.

• There are advantages of entering into the merger agreement in comparison with the risks of remaining independent, based
on consideration by the Ixia board of Ixia’s current business and financial plans in the short- and long-term, including
Ixia’s ability to grow organically and through acquisitions, the risks inherent in Ixia’s industry, the economy and capital
markets as a whole, and the various additional risks and uncertainties that are listed in Item 1A of Part I of Ixia’s most
recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016.

• Deutsche Bank’s financial analysis with respect to the consideration of $19.65 per share of Ixia common stock and the oral
opinion of Deutsche Bank to the Ixia board, which was to be subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion to
the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered, and limitations, qualifications, and conditions on the review undertaken in connection therewith, as
described in Deutsche Bank’s opinion, the consideration of $19.65 in cash per share of Ixia common stock was fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Ixia common stock (other than Keysight and its affiliates), as more fully
described below under the section entitled “The Merger—Opinion of Ixia’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 40 of
this proxy statement.

• The likelihood that the merger will be consummated based on, among other things, the limited number of conditions to the
merger, the absence of a financing condition, Keysight’s representation that it will have sufficient funds available to pay
the aggregate merger consideration and all fees and expenses payable by Keysight and Merger Sub and consummate the
merger, the Ixia board’s and Ixia

TABLE OF CONTENTS

management’s assessment, after discussion with Deutsche Bank, that Keysight has the financial capability to complete the
merger, the relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals, and the remedies available under the merger
agreement to Ixia in the event of various breaches by Keysight.

• The nature of the representations, warranties, and covenants of Ixia in the merger agreement.

• The ability to consider and respond to acquisition proposals, under certain circumstances specified in the merger
agreement, and after complying with the terms of the merger agreement, to terminate the merger agreement in order to
enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal, subject to payment of a termination fee of approximately
$59.7 million.

• The fact that the terms and conditions of the merger agreement minimize, to the extent reasonably practical, the risk that a
condition to closing will not be satisfied and also provide reasonable flexibility to operate Ixia’s business during the
pendency of the merger.

• The fact that under certain circumstances if Ixia terminates the merger agreement due to Keysight’s failure to complete the
merger, Ixia is entitled to receive a termination fee from Keysight of $500 million.

• The availability of dissenters’ rights for shareholders who properly exercise such statutory rights.

• The fact that the shareholders who are parties to the voting agreements are not bound by them if Ixia terminates the merger
agreement in accordance with its terms, allowing such shareholders to vote in favor of an alternative transaction, if any,
that may be entered into by Ixia.

The Ixia board also considered a variety of potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger agreement,
including the following (not in any relative order of importance):

• Ixia will no longer exist as an independent company, and Ixia shareholders will no longer participate in any future growth
it may have or any potential future increase in its value.

• Ixia is obligated to pay to Keysight a termination fee of approximately $59.7 million if the merger agreement is terminated
under certain circumstances, including if Ixia terminates the merger agreement to enter into the definitive agreement with
respect to a superior proposal.

• There can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the merger will be satisfied, and as a
result, it is possible that the merger may not be completed even if the merger agreement is approved by Ixia’s
shareholders. If the merger is not completed, (i) Ixia will have incurred significant risk and transaction costs, including the
possibility of disruption to Ixia’s operations, diversion of management and employee attention, employee attrition, and a
potentially negative effect on Ixia’s business and customer relationships, (ii) the trading price of shares of Ixia common
stock could be adversely affected, and (iii) the market’s perceptions of Ixia’s prospects could be adversely affected.

• Certain terms of the merger agreement prohibit Ixia and its representatives from soliciting third-party bids and from
accepting, approving, or recommending third-party bids except in limited circumstances, which could reduce the
likelihood that other potential acquirers would propose an alternative transaction that may be more advantageous to the
shareholders.

• Ixia’s management’s focus and resources may become diverted from other important business opportunities and
operational matters while working to implement the merger, which could adversely affect Ixia’s business.

• Public announcement of the transaction could have an adverse effect on Ixia’s operations, stock price, and employees and
its ability to attract and retain key management and sales personnel while the merger is pending, as could a possible suit,
action, or proceeding in respect of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

• The operations of Ixia will be restricted by interim operating covenants during the period between signing the merger
agreement and the closing of the merger, which could effectively limit Ixia’s ability to respond to changing market and
business conditions in a timely manner or at all.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• There is a risk of incurring substantial expenses related to the merger, including in connection with any litigation that may
result from the announcement or pendency of the merger.

• The merger will be a taxable transaction to Ixia shareholders that are U.S. holders (as defined in “—Material U.S. Federal
Income Tax Consequences” beginning on page 54 of this proxy statement) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and,
therefore, such shareholders generally will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on any gains they recognize as a
result of the receipt of cash in the merger.

The Ixia board also considered that certain of our directors and officers may have conflicts of interest in connection with the
merger, as they may receive certain benefits that are different from, or in addition to, those of our other shareholders. See “—
Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 49 of this proxy statement.

After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Ixia board unanimously agreed that the benefits
of the merger outweighed the drawbacks and risks and determined that the merger is fair to, and in the best interests of, Ixia and its
shareholders and approved and declared advisable the merger agreement, the merger, and the other transactions contemplated
thereby and recommended that our shareholders vote to approve the merger agreement and the principal terms of the merger at the
special meeting.

The foregoing discussion is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the information and factors considered by the Ixia board in
its consideration of the merger, but is merely a summary of the material positive factors and negative factors and risks considered by
the Ixia board in that regard. In view of the number and variety of factors and the amount of information considered, the Ixia board
did not find it practicable to, and did not make specific assessments of, quantify, or otherwise assign relative weights to, the specific
factors considered in reaching its determination. In addition, the Ixia board did not undertake to make any specific determination as
to whether any one particular factor, or any aspect of any one particular factor, caused the Ixia board to reach its ultimate
determination, and individual members of the Ixia board may have given different weights to different factors. The Ixia board made
its recommendation based on the totality of information presented to, and the evaluation conducted by, the Ixia board.

Opinion of Ixia’s Financial Advisor

At the January 29, 2017 meeting of the Ixia board, Deutsche Bank, financial advisor to Ixia, rendered its oral opinion to the
Ixia board, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated January 30, 2017 to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and
based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations, qualifications, and
conditions on the review undertaken in connection therewith, as described in Deutsche Bank’s opinion, the consideration of $19.65
in cash per share of Ixia common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Ixia common stock (other than
Keysight and its affiliates). The full text of Deutsche Bank’s written opinion, dated January 30, 2017, which sets forth the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and limitations, qualifications, and conditions on the review
undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and is incorporated herein by
reference (the “opinion”). The summary of Deutsche Bank’s opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion. Deutsche Bank’s opinion was approved and authorized for issuance by a
Deutsche Bank fairness opinion review committee and was addressed to, and for the use and benefit of, the Ixia board in
connection with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the merger. Deutsche Bank’s opinion was limited to the fairness of
the consideration of $19.65 in cash per share, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Ixia common stock (other than
Keysight and its affiliates) as of the date of the opinion. The opinion did not address any other terms of the merger, the
merger agreement, or any other agreement entered into or to be entered into in connection with the merger. The Ixia board
did not ask Deutsche Bank to, and Deutsche Bank’s opinion did not, address the fairness of the merger, or any consideration
received in connection therewith, to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of Ixia, nor
did it address the fairness of the contemplated benefits of the merger. Deutsche Bank expressed no opinion as to the merits of
the underlying decision by Ixia to engage in the merger or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any alternative
transactions or business strategies. Nor did Deutsche Bank express an opinion, and Deutsche Bank’s opinion does not
constitute a recommendation, as to how any holder of shares of Ixia common stock should vote with respect to the merger. In
addition, Deutsche Bank did not express any view or opinion as to the fairness, financial or

otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or to be received by any of the officers, directors, or
employees of Ixia, or any class of such persons, in connection with the merger, whether relative to the consideration of $19.65
in cash per share or otherwise.

No limitations were imposed by the Ixia board upon Deutsche Bank with respect to the investigations made or procedures
followed by it in rendering its opinion. In connection with its role as financial advisor to Ixia in connection with the merger, and in
arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Bank reviewed certain publicly available financial and other information concerning Ixia and
certain internal analyses, financial forecasts, and other information relating to Ixia prepared by management of Ixia, including the
Ixia management projections summarized under “—Certain Ixia Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page
47 of this proxy statement. Deutsche Bank also held discussions with certain senior officers of Ixia regarding the businesses and
prospects of Ixia. In addition, Deutsche Bank:

• reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Ixia common stock;

• compared certain financial and stock market information for Ixia with, to the extent publicly available, similar information
for certain other companies it considered relevant whose securities are publicly traded;

• reviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial terms of certain recent business combinations which Deutsche
Bank deemed relevant;

• reviewed the merger agreement; and

• performed such other studies and analyses and considered such other factors as Deutsche Bank deemed appropriate.

Deutsche Bank did not assume responsibility for independent verification of, and did not independently verify, any
information, whether publicly available or furnished to it, concerning Ixia, including, without limitation, any financial information
considered in connection with the rendering of its opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of its opinion, Deutsche Bank, with the
knowledge and permission of the Ixia board, assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information.
Deutsche Bank did not conduct a physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and did not prepare, obtain, or review any
independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative, or off-balance-sheet
assets or liabilities), of Ixia, Keysight, or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor did Deutsche Bank evaluate the solvency or fair
value of Ixia, Keysight, or any of their respective subsidiaries (or the impact of the merger thereon) under any law relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar matters. With respect to the financial forecasts made available to Deutsche Bank and used in its
analyses, Deutsche Bank assumed with the knowledge and permission of the Ixia board that such forecasts had been reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Ixia as to the matters
covered thereby. In rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank expressed no view as to the reasonableness of such forecasts and
projections or the assumptions on which they were based. Deutsche Bank’s opinion was necessarily based upon economic, market,
and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of its opinion. Deutsche Bank expressly
disclaimed any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting its opinion of which it
becomes aware after the date of its opinion.

For purposes of rendering its opinion, Deutsche Bank assumed, with the knowledge and permission of the Ixia board, that in all
respects material to its analysis, the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, without
any waiver, modification, or amendment of any term, condition, or agreement that would be material to Deutsche Bank’s analysis.
Deutsche Bank also assumed, with the knowledge and permission of the Ixia board, that all material governmental, regulatory, or
other approvals and consents required in connection with the consummation of the merger will be obtained and that, in connection
with obtaining any necessary governmental, regulatory, or other approvals and consents, no restrictions, terms, or conditions will be
imposed that would be material to its analysis. Deutsche Bank is not a legal, regulatory, tax, or accounting expert and has relied on
the assessments made by Ixia and its other advisors with respect to such issues.

Ixia selected Deutsche Bank as its financial advisor in connection with the merger based on Deutsche Bank’s qualifications,
expertise, reputation, and experience in mergers and acquisitions. Pursuant to an engagement letter between Ixia and Deutsche
Bank, dated October 10, 2016, Ixia has agreed to pay Deutsche

Bank a fee estimated to be approximately $23.5 million for its services as financial advisor to Ixia in connection with the merger, of
which $750,000 became payable upon delivery of its opinion (or would have become payable if Deutsche Bank had advised the Ixia
board that it was unable to render its opinion), and the remainder of which is contingent upon consummation of the merger. In
addition, subject to the terms of the engagement letter, if the merger is not consummated, Ixia has agreed to pay Deutsche Bank a
percentage of any payment to which it is entitled under the merger agreement in connection with the termination thereof. Ixia has
also agreed to reimburse Deutsche Bank for the fees, expenses, and disbursements of its counsel and Deutsche Bank’s travel and
other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the merger or otherwise arising out of its engagement by Ixia, in each case
on the terms set forth in its engagement letter. Ixia has also agreed to indemnify Deutsche Bank and its affiliates against certain
liabilities in connection with its engagement.

Deutsche Bank is an internationally recognized investment banking firm experienced in providing advice in connection with
mergers and acquisitions and related transactions. Deutsche Bank is an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG (together with its affiliates,
the “DB Group”). One or more members of the DB Group have, from time to time, provided, and are currently providing,
investment banking, commercial banking (including extension of credit), or other financial services to Keysight or its affiliates for
which they have received, and in the future may receive, compensation, including acting as a lender under Keysight’s credit
agreement since September 2014 (which credit agreement was extended following the announcement of the merger). The DB Group
has received approximately €250,000 in fees from Keysight with respect to such services since January 1, 2014. The DB Group has
not received fees from Ixia with respect to any investment banking, transaction banking, and corporate banking unrelated to the
merger since January 1, 2014. The DB Group may also provide investment and commercial banking services to Keysight, Ixia, or
their respective affiliates in the future, for which Deutsche Bank expects the DB Group to receive compensation. In the ordinary
course of business, members of the DB Group may actively trade in the securities and other instruments and obligations of
Keysight, Ixia, and their respective affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. Accordingly, the DB
Group may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, instruments, and obligations.

Summary of Material Financial Analyses of Deutsche Bank

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Deutsche Bank to the Ixia board at its meeting held
on January 29, 2017, and that were used in connection with rendering its opinion described above.

The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by
Deutsche Bank, nor does the order in which the analyses are described below represent the relative importance or weight given to
the analyses by Deutsche Bank. Some of the summaries of financial analyses below include information presented in tabular format.
In order to fully understand the analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of Deutsche Bank’s analyses. Considering the data described below without considering the full
narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that
it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before January 27, 2017, and is not necessarily indicative of
current market conditions.

In preparing its analyses, Deutsche Bank utilized calculations of, among other things, (i) total enterprise value (“TEV”),
calculated as equity value plus, if applicable, minority interest plus net debt, (ii) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization adjusted to exclude the impact of certain non-cash and non-recurring items such as stock based compensation expense,
amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, restructuring costs, expenses related to acquisitions and certain other items
(“Adjusted EBITDA”), and (iii) diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of certain non-cash and non-recurring
items such as stock based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, restructuring costs, expenses
related to acquisitions, and the associated income tax effects, and certain other non-cash items (“Adjusted EPS”). For additional
information regarding the financial data provided by management of Ixia underlying these calculations, please see “—Certain Ixia
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 47 of this proxy statement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Selected Companies Analysis

Deutsche Bank reviewed and compared certain financial information and commonly used valuation measurements for Ixia with
corresponding financial information and valuation measurements for the following publicly traded companies in the testing and
measurement (“T&M”) and enterprise networking industries:
 T&M Companies Enterprise Companies  
    
 Keysight Arista Networks, Inc.  
 Teradyne, Inc. Fortinet, Inc.  
 National Instruments Corporation Gigamon Inc.  
 NetScout Systems, Inc.   
 Viavi Solutions Inc.   
 Spirent Communications plc   

Although none of the above selected companies is directly comparable to Ixia, for the purpose of selecting the companies for
this analysis, Deutsche Bank utilized its professional judgment and experience as investment bankers, taking into account several
factors, including, among other things, Ixia’s operational capabilities and financial profile compared with those of the selected
companies, the competitive landscape in which Ixia and the selected companies operate, and Ixia’s product offerings and those of
the selected companies. Accordingly, the analysis of selected publicly traded companies was not simply mathematical. Rather, it
involved complex considerations and qualitative judgments, reflected in the opinion of Deutsche Bank, concerning differences in
financial and operating characteristics of the selected companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value of such
companies.

Based on the closing prices of the common stock or common equity of each of the selected companies on January 27, 2017,
information contained in the most recent public filings of the selected companies, and analyst consensus estimates of Adjusted
EBITDA and Adjusted EPS for calendar years 2016 and 2017 for each of the selected companies, Deutsche Bank calculated the
following multiples with respect to each of the selected companies:

• TEV as a multiple of calendar years 2016 and 2017 estimated Adjusted EBITDA; and

• Price as a multiple of calendar years 2016 and 2017 estimated Adjusted EPS.

Deutsche Bank also calculated the same multiples for Ixia based upon Ixia management estimates of calendar year 2016 and
2017 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS.

The results of this analysis are summarized as follows:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Based in part upon the multiples of the selected companies described above and taking into account its professional judgment
and experience, Deutsche Bank calculated the following ranges of implied values per share of Ixia common stock on a fully diluted
basis:

• approximately $12.57 to $14.69 per share of Ixia common stock by applying multiples of TEV to estimated calendar year
2016 Adjusted EBITDA of 10.0x to 12.0x to Ixia management estimates of calendar year 2016 Adjusted EBITDA;

• approximately $13.24 to $16.38 per share of Ixia common stock by applying multiples of TEV to estimated calendar year
2017 Adjusted EBITDA of 9.0x to 11.5x to Ixia management estimates of calendar year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA;

• approximately $11.67 to $16.21 per share of Ixia common stock by applying multiples of 18.0x to 25.0x to Ixia
management estimates of Adjusted EPS for calendar year 2016; and

• approximately $11.99 to $18.74 per share of Ixia common stock by applying multiples of 16.0x to 25.0x to Ixia
management estimates of Adjusted EPS for calendar year 2017.

Selected Transactions Analysis

Deutsche Bank reviewed publicly available information relating to the following eight selected transactions involving
enterprise communications companies announced since January 1, 2011 in which the target company had a three-year revenue
compound annual growth rate of less than 10% (the “selected transactions”). Deutsche Bank noted that Ixia’s historical three-year
revenue compound annual growth rate was approximately 1%.

Date Announced Target Acquirer

Teachers’ Pension Plan

Although none of the selected transactions is directly comparable to the merger, the companies that participated in the selected
transactions were selected by Deutsche Bank based upon its professional judgment and experience as investment bankers and its
knowledge of transactions of a similar nature and are such that, for purposes of analysis, the selected transactions may be considered
similar to the merger.

With respect to each selected transaction and based on publicly available information, Deutsche Bank calculated the multiples
of the targets’ TEV to:

• last 12 months (“LTM”) Adjusted EBITDA;

• estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the next 12 months (“NTM”) following the announcement of the transaction;

• LTM revenue; and

• estimated NTM revenue.

Deutsche Bank also calculated the same multiples for the merger based upon Ixia management estimates of calendar year 2016
and 2017 Adjusted EBITDA and revenue.

Based in part upon the multiples of the selected transactions described above, and taking into account its professional judgment
and experience, Deutsche Bank calculated the ranges of estimated implied values per share of Ixia common stock by applying the
following multiples of:

• 11.0x to 15.0x to estimated calendar year 2016 Adjusted EBITDA provided by management of Ixia, resulting in a range of
implied values of approximately $13.63 to $17.88 per share of Ixia common stock;

• 10.0x to 14.0x to estimated calendar year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA provided by management of Ixia, resulting in a range of
implied values of approximately $14.50 to $19.52 per share of Ixia common stock;

• 2.6x to 3.3x to estimated calendar year 2016 revenue provided by management of Ixia, resulting in a range of implied
values of approximately $15.88 to $19.64 per share of Ixia common stock; and

• 2.3x to 3.0x to estimated calendar year 2017 revenue provided by management of Ixia, resulting in a range of implied
values of approximately $15.35 to $19.44 per share of Ixia common stock.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Deutsche Bank performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Ixia using financial forecasts and other information and data
provided by Ixia’s management to calculate a range of implied net present values per share of Ixia common stock as of January 27,
2017. In performing the discounted cash flow analysis, Deutsche Bank applied a range of discount rates of 10.0% to 12.0% to (i)
estimates of after-tax unlevered free cash flows for calendar years December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2021 that were
calculated by Deutsche Bank based on information contained in Ixia management forecasts and assumptions approved for use by
Ixia management (see “—Certain Ixia Unaudited Prospective Financial Information” beginning on page 47 of this proxy
statement), using the mid-year convention and (ii) estimated terminal values using a range of perpetuity growth rates of 2.5% to
3.5%. For purposes of its financial analyses, Deutsche Bank calculated unlevered free cash flow as (a) Adjusted EBITDA, less (b)
stock based compensation, less (c) taxes, less (d) capital expenditures, less (e) change in working capital. Deutsche Bank derived the
foregoing range of discount rates utilizing a weighted average cost of capital analysis based on certain financial metrics for Ixia and
the selected companies described above under “—Selected Companies Analysis.” This analysis resulted in a range of implied
present values of Ixia common stock as of January 27, 2017 of approximately $14.42 to $19.79 per share.

Other Information

Deutsche Bank also noted for the Ixia board certain additional factors that were not considered part of its financial analysis
with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes.

Specifically, Deutsche Bank reviewed the historical trading performance of Ixia common stock over various periods, including
the 52-week and three-year periods ended December 1, 2016, which was the last trading day prior to publication of reports that Ixia
was exploring a potential sale transaction. The 52-week and three-year periods ending December 1, 2016 indicated low to high
closing stock prices for Ixia common stock of approximately $8.71 to $14.20 per share and $8.54 to $15.76 per share, respectively.
Deutsche Bank noted that the consideration of $19.65 in cash per share represented a premium of approximately 45% to the
unaffected closing price of $13.55 per share of Ixia common stock on December 1, 2016 and a premium of approximately 38% to
the 52-week unaffected high closing price per share of Ixia common stock of $14.20 on November 22, 2016.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Deutsche Bank also reviewed publicly available one-year forward Wall Street research analysts’ stock price targets for shares
of Ixia common stock published before December 2, 2016, which, on an undiscounted basis, ranged from $11.00 to $16.00 per share
and, on a discounted basis (discounted one year using an 11% cost of equity), ranged from approximately $9.91 to $14.41 per share.

In addition, Deutsche Bank reviewed the premiums paid in 123 selected U.S. transactions and 36 selected U.S. technology
transactions of such 123 transactions announced since January 1, 2011 (excluding cancelled, hostile, merger-of-equals, real estate,
and financial transactions), with transaction values ranging from approximately $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion, based on closing stock
prices of the target companies involved in such transactions one day, and on the high closing stock prices of such target companies
during the 52-week period, prior to public announcement of the relevant transaction. Negative premiums for the one-day and
premiums above 200% premiums for the one-day and 52-week periods observed were considered not meaningful. The overall
implied 25th percentile to 75th percentile premiums for such one-day and 52-week periods observed for these transactions ranged
from (i) for the selected U.S. transactions, approximately 19% to 45% (with a median of 31%) and negative 4% to 19% (with a
median of 9%), respectively, and (ii) for the selected U.S. technology transactions, approximately 20% to 43% (with a median of
31%) and negative 3% to 18% (with a median of 9%), respectively.

Based in part upon the premiums of the selected transactions described above, and taking into account its professional
judgment and experience, Deutsche Bank calculated ranges of estimated implied values per share of Ixia common stock by
applying:

• premiums of 20% to 45% to the $13.55 closing price per share of Ixia common stock on December 1, 2016, resulting in a
range of implied values of approximately $16.26 to $19.65 per share of Ixia common stock; and

• premiums of negative 5% to 20% to the $14.20 52-week high closing price per share of Ixia common stock as of
December 1, 2016, resulting in a range of implied values of approximately $13.49 to $17.04 per share of Ixia common
stock.

Miscellaneous

This summary is not a complete description of Deutsche Bank’s opinion or the underlying analyses and factors considered in
connection with Deutsche Bank’s opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving the application of
subjective business and financial judgment in determining the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the
application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. Deutsche Bank believes that its analyses described above must be considered as a whole and that considering any
portion of such analyses and of the factors considered without considering all analyses and factors could create a misleading view of
the process underlying its opinion. Selecting portions of the analyses or summary set forth above, without considering the analyses
as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the Deutsche Bank opinion. In arriving at its fairness
determination, Deutsche Bank considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or
analysis. Rather, it made its fairness determination on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the
results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction in the analyses described above is identical to Ixia or the merger.

In conducting its analyses and arriving at its opinion, Deutsche Bank utilized a variety of generally accepted valuation
methods. The analyses were prepared solely for the purpose of enabling Deutsche Bank to provide its opinion to the Ixia board as to
the fairness of the consideration of $19.65 in cash per share, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Ixia common stock
(other than Keysight and its affiliates) as of the date of the opinion and do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the
prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold, which are inherently subject to uncertainty. As described above, in
connection with its analyses, Deutsche Bank made, and was provided by the management of Ixia with, numerous assumptions with
respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions, and other matters, many of which are beyond the
control of Deutsche Bank or Ixia. Analyses based on estimates or forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual,
past, or future values or results, which may be significantly more or less

favorable than suggested by such analyses. Because such analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous
factors or events beyond the control of Ixia or its respective advisors, Deutsche Bank does not assume responsibility if future results
or actual values are materially different from these forecasts or assumptions.

The terms of the merger, including the merger consideration, were determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Ixia
and Keysight and were approved by the Ixia board. Although Deutsche Bank provided advice to the Ixia board during the course of
these negotiations, the decision to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of the Ixia board.

Deutsche Bank did not recommend any specific consideration to Ixia or the Ixia board, or that any specific amount or type of
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the transaction. As described above, the opinion of Deutsche Bank
and its presentation to the Ixia board were among a number of factors taken into consideration by the Ixia board in making its
determination to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder.

Certain Ixia Unaudited Prospective Financial Information

In connection with the merger, Ixia management prepared certain financial analyses and forecasts (the “Ixia forecasts”) for
internal use and provided them to the Ixia board, for the purposes of considering, analyzing, and evaluating Ixia’s strategic and
financial alternatives, including the merger. The Ixia forecasts were also provided to Deutsche Bank in connection with performing
its financial analysis in connection with rendering its opinion to the Ixia board, and to Keysight to evaluate a potential acquisition of
Ixia.

Except for limited quarterly guidance, Ixia does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future revenue,
earnings, or other results due, among other reasons, to the inherent difficulty in accurately predicting financial performance for
future periods and the uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Ixia management prepared the limited
unaudited prospective financial information set forth in the table below, to provide Ixia’s shareholders with access to certain
nonpublic information that was made available to the Ixia board, Deutsche Bank, and Keysight for purposes of considering and
evaluating the merger. Such prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or with a view
toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to
prospective financial information, but, in the view of the Ixia's management, was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting the best
available estimates and judgments, and presented, to the best of Ixia management's knowledge and belief, the expected course of
action and the expected future financial performance of Ixia at the time of their preparation. However, this information is not fact
and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not
to place undue reliance on the prospective financial information.

Neither the Company's independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed
any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any
other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with,
the prospective financial information.

The assumptions and estimates underlying the prospective financial information are inherently uncertain and, though
considered reasonable by Ixia management as of the date of its preparation, are subject to a wide variety of significant business,
economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the
prospective financial information, including, among others, risks and uncertainties described in the section entitled “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” on page 18 of this proxy statement could cause the Ixia forecasts and/or the
underlying assumptions to be inaccurate. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the prospective results are indicative of the
future performance of Ixia or that actual results will not differ materially from those presented in the prospective financial
information.

Ixia does not generally publish its business plans and strategies or, except for limited quarterly guidance, make external
disclosures of its anticipated financial position or results of operations. Accordingly, Ixia does not intend to update or otherwise
revise the prospective financial information to reflect circumstances existing since its preparation or to reflect the occurrence of
unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all of the underlying assumptions are shown to be in error. Furthermore, the
Company does not intend to update or revise the prospective financial information to reflect changes in general economic or
industry conditions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Additional information relating to the principal assumptions used in preparing the projections is set forth below. See
“Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 18 of this proxy statement for a description of
various factors that could materially affect the Company's financial condition, results of operations, business, prospects, and
securities.

The inclusion of the Ixia forecasts should not be regarded as an indication that the Ixia board, Ixia, Deutsche Bank, Keysight,
or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, such information to be an assurance of the achievement of
future results or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied upon as such.

The Ixia forecasts and the underlying assumptions upon which the Ixia forecasts were based are subjective in many respects
and subject to multiple interpretations and revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The Ixia forecasts
reflect numerous assumptions with respect to company performance, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory,
market, and financial conditions, and other matters, many of which are difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and
competitive uncertainties, and beyond Ixia’s control. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Ixia forecasts will be realized or
that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected. Because the Ixia forecasts cover multiple years, such
information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. The Ixia forecasts do not take into account any
circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared. Economic and business environments can and do
change quickly, which adds an additional significant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Ixia forecasts will
be achieved. As a result, the inclusion of the Ixia forecasts in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation
by Ixia or any other person that the information is material. The summary of the Ixia forecasts is not provided to influence Ixia
shareholders’ decisions regarding whether to vote for the Merger Proposal.

The Ixia forecasts were not prepared with a view toward compliance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”) or published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections or forward-looking statements; provided, however,
that the revenue forecast was prepared in a manner consistent with GAAP.

In light of the foregoing factors and the uncertainties inherent in the Ixia forecasts, Ixia’s shareholders are cautioned not to
place undue, if any, reliance on the information presented in the summary of the Ixia forecasts that follows.

Ixia forecasts
 Fiscal Year Ending December 31,
 2016 2017 2018 2019
 (in millions, except per share data)
Revenue $ 484 $ 526 $ 563 $ 604 
Adjusted EBITDA(1) $ 96 $ 113 $ 131 $ 152 
Adjusted EPS(2) $ 0.65 $ 0.75 $ 0.87 $ 1.01 

(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude the impact
of certain non-cash and non-recurring items such as stock based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, restructuring
costs, expenses related to acquisitions and certain other items.

(2) Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of certain non-cash and non-recurring
items such as stock based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, restructuring costs, expenses related to acquisitions, and
the associated income tax effects and certain other non-cash income tax items.

As part of its discounted cash flow analysis, Deutsche Bank calculated after-tax unlevered free cash flow based upon financial
information provided by Ixia management for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 (the “initial
period”). Deutsche Bank calculated after-tax unlevered free cash flow as (a) Adjusted EBITDA, less (b) stock based compensation,
less, (c) taxes, less (d) capital expenditures, less (e) change in working capital. Working capital was calculated as current assets plus

TABLE OF CONTENTS

based upon information contained in Ixia management’s forecasts for the initial period and assumptions approved for use by Ixia,
which amounts were approved for Deutsche Bank’s use by Ixia.

The Ixia forecasts do not take into account the possible financial impact and other effects of the merger on Ixia and do not
attempt to predict or suggest future results following the consummation of the merger. The Ixia forecasts do not give effect to the
merger, including the impact of negotiating or executing the merger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection
with consummating the merger, the potential synergies that may be achieved following the consummation of the merger, the effect
on Ixia of any business or strategic decision or action that has been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been
executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or actions that would likely have been taken if the merger agreement
had not been executed, but that were instead altered, accelerated, postponed, or not taken in anticipation of the merger. Further, the
Ixia forecasts do not take into account the effect on Ixia of any possible failure of the merger to occur.

For the foregoing reasons, and considering that the special meeting will be held several months after the Ixia forecasts were
prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting information, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to
place unwarranted reliance on the Ixia forecasts. No one has made or makes any representation to any shareholder regarding the
information included in the Ixia forecasts. Ixia urges all Ixia shareholders to review Ixia’s most recent SEC filings for a description
of its reported financial results.

Interests of Our Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

In considering the recommendation of the Ixia board that the shareholders vote to approve the merger, shareholders should be
aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of
our shareholders generally. Interests of the directors and executive officers are or may be different from or in addition to the interests
of the shareholders for the following reasons, among others: potential employment of our executive officers following the merger
with Keysight, with the surviving corporation, or with one of their respective affiliates; the treatment pursuant to the merger
agreement of outstanding Ixia stock options and Ixia RSUs held by them; potential change in control severance compensation and
benefits payable to them under our officer severance plans; and their rights under the merger agreement to ongoing indemnification
and insurance coverage. The members of the Ixia board were aware of such different or additional interests and considered those
interests, among other matters, in negotiating, evaluating, and approving the merger and the merger agreement, and in
recommending to the shareholders that the merger be approved.

Possible New Employment Arrangements

As of the date of this proxy statement, it is expected that certain of our executive officers may, prior to or upon completion of
the merger, enter into new employment arrangements with Keysight, with the surviving corporation, or with one of their respective
affiliates. As of the date of this proxy statement, however, none of our executive officers has agreed upon the terms of, or entered
into, any such employment arrangement.

Treatment of Ixia Equity Awards

Ixia Stock Options. Each Ixia stock option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time will, at the effective time, automatically become fully vested (to the extent not then vested) and be cancelled in consideration
for the right to receive, following the effective time, a cash payment equal to the product of (a) the total number of shares of Ixia
common stock subject to such cancelled Ixia stock option immediately prior to the effective time and (b) the excess, if any, of (1)
the merger consideration of $19.65 per share over (2) the exercise price per share of such cancelled Ixia stock option, without
interest and as reduced by the amount of any tax withholding required by law. Each Ixia stock option with respect to which,
immediately prior to the effective time, the exercise price per share subject thereto is equal to or greater than $19.65 will be
cancelled at the effective time in exchange for no consideration.

Ixia Restricted Stock Unit Awards. At the effective time, each Ixia RSU will automatically become fully vested and be
cancelled in consideration for the right to receive, following the effective time, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the
product of (a) the total number of shares of Ixia common stock subject to such Ixia RSU immediately prior to the effective time and
(b) the merger consideration of $19.65 per share, without interest and as reduced by the amount of any tax withholding required by
law. If immediately prior to the

effective time, an Ixia RSU remains subject to a performance-based vesting condition, such Ixia PRSU will, at such time and in
accordance with the terms thereof, become earned at the target performance level, and such Ixia PRSU will, at the effective time,
become fully vested and be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive, following the effective time, a cash payment with
respect thereto that is the same as the cash payment described in the preceding sentence for other Ixia RSUs that are cancelled at the
effective time.

Ixia, as the surviving corporation in the merger, will cause the option payments and the RSU payments to be paid, less any
required tax withholdings, as promptly as practicable following the effective time (and not later than the first regularly scheduled
payroll date on or after the fifth business day after the effective time) through its payroll systems.

Quantification of Outstanding Equity Awards

Ixia Stock Options. The following table sets forth, for each of our executive officers and directors, as of March 10, 2017 and
assuming that the merger is completed on March 10, 2017: (a) the total number of shares of Ixia common stock subject to vested
Ixia stock options, (b) the aggregate value of such vested Ixia stock options, based on the merger consideration and without taking
into consideration any required tax withholding, (c) the total number of shares of Ixia common stock subject to unvested Ixia stock
options that become fully vested at the effective time, (d) the aggregate value of such unvested Ixia stock options, based on the
merger consideration and without taking into consideration any tax withholding required by law, and (e) the total amount of
consideration to be paid to such individuals with respect to their Ixia stock options in connection with the merger, without taking
into consideration any tax withholding required by law. The numbers and amounts in the table do not reflect any exercises or grants
of Ixia stock options that may occur between March 10, 2017 and the actual closing date of the merger. The numbers also do not
include shares that our executive officers may acquire after March 10, 2017 under the Ixia 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as
amended, and do not reflect Ixia stock options with an exercise price greater than $19.65 per share, which options will be cancelled
at the effective time without the payment of any consideration therefor.

Change in Control Severance Compensation and Benefits

Ixia currently has two officer severance plans. In 2000, we adopted the original Ixia Officer Severance Plan, which, as
amended, is referred to in this proxy statement as the “2000 severance plan.” In 2009, we effectively created a second officer
severance plan by amending and restating the original Ixia Officer Severance Plan in the form of the “Ixia Officer Severance Plan
(As Amended and Restated effective January 1, 2009),” which plan, as amended, was further amended and restated in February
2016 in the form of the “Ixia Officer Severance Plan (As Amended and Restated effective February 12, 2016).” That plan, as
amended, is referred to in this proxy statement as our “2009 severance plan.” The 2009 severance plan currently applies to all of our
executive officers other than Mr. Ginsberg, who in January 2009 made an irrevocable election to remain as an eligible officer under
the 2000 severance plan.

Under the applicable severance plan, each of our executive officers is eligible to receive cash severance compensation and
benefits if his or her employment terminates under certain conditions in connection with a change in control of the Company, such
as the proposed merger.

In connection with the merger, an executive officer will be eligible to receive severance compensation and benefits if, upon or
within two years following the change in control, he or she (a) is terminated by the surviving corporation or the acquiror without
“cause” (as defined in the applicable severance plan) or (b) elects to terminate his or her employment for “good reason” (as defined
in the applicable severance plan).

The 2000 severance plan and the 2009 severance plan both define “cause” to include, among other things, conduct amounting
to gross incompetence, refusal or failure to perform material, appropriate duties, or to follow important policies, certain unlawful
acts, and material breaches of nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality

TABLE OF CONTENTS

obligations. The 2000 severance plan defines “good reason” to include, among other things, a reduction in annual base salary, a
reduction in or discontinuation of certain benefits, a requirement that the officer be based for six months or more at a location more
than 30 miles from the officer’s principal place of employment prior to the change in control, the assignment to the officer of duties
significantly inconsistent with the officer’s position prior to the change in control, or a significantly adverse change in the nature or
status of the officer’s responsibilities or conditions of employment from those in effect prior to the change in control. The 2009
severance plan generally defines “good reason” to include, among other things, a material diminution in compensation or in the
officer’s authority, duties, or responsibilities, a material change in the geographic location at which the officer must perform
services, or any action or inaction constituting a material breach of the 2009 severance plan or any agreement under which the
officer provides services to the Company.

Severance benefits under both of our severance plans include cash severance compensation as well as continuation, at the
Company’s expense, of health care insurance for a period of 18 months following termination of employment.

Under the 2000 severance plan, in the event of a qualifying termination of employment in connection with the merger, Mr.
Ginsberg will be entitled to receive cash severance compensation equal to 300% of his highest “annual compensation.” The 2000
severance plan defines “annual compensation” as the sum of the officer’s annual base salary rate for a calendar year plus the bonus
earned for the immediately preceding calendar year.

Under the 2009 severance plan, in the event of a qualifying termination of employment in connection with the merger, each
executive officer other than Mr. Ginsberg will be entitled to receive cash severance equal to a percentage (200% in the case of Ms.
Mayer and 125% in the case of other executive officers) of his or her most recent annual compensation, which is defined as the sum
of the officer’s highest regular rate of base salary during the calendar year in which termination occurs and his or her target bonus
for that year (or for the prior calendar year if his or her target bonus has not yet been approved for the year during which termination
occurs).

The table under “__Golden Parachute Compensation” below sets forth the amounts of the cash severance payments and the
estimated values of the health care coverage benefit that each of Ms. Mayer and Messrs. Novak, Ginsberg, Pepe, and Cox would
receive under the applicable severance plan if he or she were to experience a qualifying termination of employment on an assumed
closing date for the merger of March 10, 2017. If our other executive officers were to become entitled to such severance
compensation and benefits in connection with the merger, the amounts of the cash severance compensation that, subject to the terms
and conditions of the applicable plan, they would receive would be as follows: Mr. Alexander - $660,000, Mr. Colston - $600,000,
Ms. Hattar - $700,000, Ms. Key - $831,250, and Mr. Williams - $580,000.

Each of our severance plans contains a “280G best net after-tax” provision. Under that provision, if, in connection with a
change in control of the Company an eligible officer becomes entitled to receive severance compensation and benefits and the
amount of such severance compensation and benefits would require that the officer pay an excise tax under Sections 280G and 4999
of the Code, the officer will receive either (1) the full severance compensation and benefits to which he or she is entitled under the
applicable severance plan, subject to his or her payment of the excise tax, or (2) if greater, the full amount of such severance
compensation and benefits as reduced by the minimum amount necessary to ensure that the excise tax will not apply.

As a condition of receiving severance benefits under either severance plan, an executive officer is required to sign a severance
agreement that includes, among other provisions, a release of certain claims he or she may have against Ixia and post-termination
non-solicitation and non-disparagement provisions. Under both severance plans, cash severance compensation is typically paid out
in 12 equal installments over approximately 13 months following the termination of an officer’s employment.

Golden Parachute Compensation

As required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the following table sets forth, for our named executive officers, compensation
that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger and that may (in the case of “double trigger” arrangements) or will (in the case of
“single trigger” arrangements) become payable to or realized by such individuals. For purposes of this proxy statement, our “named
executive officers” are those individuals who will be identified as named executive officers either in Ixia’s proxy statement for its
2017 annual meeting of shareholders or in an amendment on Form 10-K/A to Ixia’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year
ended December 31, 2016.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Specifically, in the event the merger occurs, the compensation that may or will be paid to or realized by our named executive
officers will consist of:

• cash severance and continuation of healthcare coverage that, under the terms of our officer severance plans, the officers
may be entitled to receive in connection with the merger upon a qualifying termination of employment; and

• cash compensation that the officers will be entitled to receive following the effective time as a result of the accelerated
vesting, in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, of Ixia stock options and Ixia RSUs that are outstanding at
the effective time.

The table assumes that: (a) the merger consideration is $19.65 per share, (b) March 10, 2017 is the date of the closing of the
merger, (c) at the effective time, the officer experiences a qualifying termination of employment that entitles him or her to change in
control severance compensation and benefits under the terms of our applicable officer severance plan, and (d) the officer does not
receive a reduction in severance compensation and benefits as a result of the potential imposition of an excise tax under Sections
280G and 4999 of the Code as described above under “__Change in Control Severance Compensation and Benefits.”

Please note that the amounts set forth in the table are subject to a non-binding, advisory vote of our shareholders, as described
in the section entitled “Proposal 3- Golden Parachute Compensation Proposal” beginning on page 27 of this proxy statement.

and that is required to be disclosed in the table.

Indemnification and Insurance

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Ixia’s directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing
indemnification from the surviving corporation after the effective time, as well as indemnification and coverage under directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policies. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled “The
Merger Agreement — Indemnification and Insurance” beginning on page 71 of this proxy statement.

Delisting and Deregistration of Shares of Ixia Common Stock

If the merger is completed, Ixia common stock will no longer be listed on NASDAQ, we will be deregistered under the
Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences

The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to holders of Ixia
common stock. This discussion is based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to
as the Code, the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and judicial and administrative rulings, all as in effect as of the
date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or varying interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. Any
such changes could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth herein. No ruling has been requested from the
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) in connection with the merger. Accordingly, the discussion below neither binds the IRS nor
precludes it from adopting a contrary position. No opinion of counsel has been or will be rendered with respect to the tax
consequences of the merger.

This discussion assumes that holders of Ixia common stock hold their shares as capital assets within the meaning of Section
1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income
taxation that may be relevant to a holder of Ixia common stock in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, nor does it discuss
the special considerations applicable to holders of Ixia common stock subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax
laws, such as, for example, financial institutions or broker-dealers, mutual funds, partnerships, or other pass-through entities and
their partners or members, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, personal holding
companies, regulated investment companies, dealers in securities, or foreign currencies, traders in securities who elect mark-to-
market method of accounting, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, U.S. expatriates, holders who
hold Ixia common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, or conversion transaction, and holders whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar. This discussion does not address the impact of the Medicare contribution tax or any aspect of
foreign, state, local, alternative minimum, estate, gift, or other tax law that may be applicable to a holder. In addition, this discussion
does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to dissenting shareholders or holders of Ixia common stock who
acquired their shares through stock option, restricted stock unit, or stock purchase plan programs or in other compensatory
arrangements.

We intend this discussion to provide only a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
merger to holders of Ixia common stock. We do not intend it to be a complete analysis or description of all potential U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the merger.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Ixia common stock, the tax
treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership, and
certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships that hold Ixia common
stock and the partners in such partnerships should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the merger to them.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

All shareholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to them (including
the application and effect of any state, local, or foreign income, and other tax laws) of the receipt of cash in exchange for
shares of Ixia common stock pursuant to the merger.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of Ixia common stock that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, is or is treated as any of the following:

• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

• a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or

• a trust if (i) it is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to
control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in effect to be treated as a United States person for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A “non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner (other than a partnership or any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) of Ixia common stock that is not a U.S. holder.

U.S. Holders

The merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or
loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant to the merger
(determined before the deduction of any applicable withholding taxes) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares
cancelled and converted into cash pursuant to the merger. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis will generally equal the price the U.S.
holder paid for such shares. Such gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the
holder’s holding period for such shares exceeds one year as of the date of the merger. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain
non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, generally will be taxable at a reduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Ixia common stock at different times or different prices, such
U.S. holder must determine such holder’s tax basis, holding period, and gain or loss, including whether any gain is long-term capital
gain, separately with respect to each block of Ixia common stock.

Additional Tax on Net Investment Income

Certain U.S. holders are subject to an additional 3.8% tax on certain net investment income earned by individuals and certain
estates and trusts, including any gain recognized in connection with the merger. In the case of an individual, the tax will be imposed
on the lesser of (i) the shareholder’s net investment income or (ii) the amount by which the shareholder’s modified adjusted gross
income exceeds a certain threshold (which is $250,000 in the case of married individuals filing jointly, $125,000 in the case of
married individuals filing separately, and $200,000 in all other cases). Certain estates and trusts that are U.S. holders also may be
subject to this tax on gain recognized as a result of the merger that is taxable to the estate or trust and not its beneficiaries. In the
case of an estate or trust subject to the tax on net investment income, the threshold at which the estate or trust becomes subject to
taxation is substantially lower (currently, $12,500) than in the case of an individual.

Non-U.S. Holders

Any gain realized on the receipt of cash in exchange for Ixia common stock pursuant to the merger by a non-U.S. holder
generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

• the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if
required by an applicable income tax treaty, the non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the United States
to which such gain is attributable);

• the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable
year of the merger and certain other requirements are met; or

• the non-U.S. holder owned (directly, indirectly, or constructively) more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Ixia common
stock at any time during the five years preceding the merger, and the Company

TABLE OF CONTENTS

is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time during
such non-U.S. holder’s ownership of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Ixia common stock. The Company does
not believe that it is or was a “United States real property holding corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the
regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at
a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain, as adjusted for
certain items.

Gain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate
specified by an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though
the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income
tax returns with respect to such losses.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

A U.S. holder may be subject to backup withholding on all payments to which such U.S. holder is entitled in connection with
the merger, unless the U.S. holder provides his, hers, or its correct taxpayer identification number and complies with applicable
certification procedures or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. In addition, if the paying agent is not
provided with a U.S. holder’s correct taxpayer identification number or other adequate basis for exemption, the U.S. holder may be
subject to certain penalties imposed by the IRS. Each U.S. holder should complete and sign the IRS Form W-9 included as part of
the letter of transmittal and timely return it to the paying agent in order to avoid backup withholding, unless an exemption applies
and is established in a manner satisfactory to the paying agent.

Certain non-U.S. holders may also be subject to backup withholding unless they establish an exemption from backup
withholding in a manner satisfactory to the paying agent (such as by completing and signing an appropriate IRS Form W-8) and
otherwise comply with the backup withholding rules. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding these
matters.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will generally be
allowable as a refund or credit against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that certain required information is
timely furnished to the IRS.

Payments made pursuant to the merger will also be subject to information reporting unless an exemption applies.

THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX DISCUSSION SET FORTH ABOVE IS INCLUDED FOR GENERAL
INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A COMPLETE ANALYSIS OR DISCUSSION OF ALL POTENTIAL
TAX CONSEQUENCES RELEVANT TO IXIA SHAREHOLDERS. THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER
MAY VARY DEPENDING UPON THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH SHAREHOLDER. YOU SHOULD
CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR CONCERNING THE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN, AND/OR OTHER
TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO YOU.

Regulatory Matters

Under the HSR Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FTC, the merger cannot be consummated
until, among other things, notifications have been given and certain information has been furnished to the FTC and the DOJ, and all
applicable waiting periods have expired or been terminated. Ixia and Keysight filed their respective notification and report forms
pursuant to the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC on February 15, 2017, and each requested “early termination” of the waiting
period. Early termination of the waiting period was granted on February 27, 2017.

At any time before the effective time, the FTC, the DOJ, state attorneys general, or private parties can file suit under the
antitrust laws seeking to enjoin consummation of the merger. There can be no assurance that the merger will not be challenged on
antitrust grounds or, if such a challenge is made, that the challenge will not be successful.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Other Jurisdictions

Additionally, under the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until any approval or clearance required under the
antitrust laws of Germany, Israel, and Russia has been obtained. The parties made the required pre-merger filings with the
applicable governmental authorities in Germany and Israel.

There can be no assurance that Ixia and Keysight will be able to obtain all required regulatory clearances and approvals.

Dissenters’ Rights

Holders of shares of Ixia common stock who vote their shares of Ixia common stock “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal and
who properly demand the purchase of such shares in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL will not have such shares converted
into the right to receive consideration otherwise payable to the holders of shares of Ixia common stock at the effective time, but such
shares will instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due pursuant to Chapter 13
of the CGCL. A copy of Chapter 13 of the CGCL is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D.

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to dissenters’ rights under the CGCL and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to Sections 1300 through 1313 of the CGCL, the full text of which is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex D and incorporated herein by reference. Annex D should be reviewed carefully by any shareholder who wishes
to exercise dissenters’ rights or who wishes to preserve the right to do so, since failure to comply with the procedures of the relevant
statute in any respect may result in the loss of dissenters’ rights.

Summary of California Dissenters’ Rights

All references in Sections 1300 through 1313 of the CGCL and in this summary to a “shareholder” are to the holder of record
of shares of Ixia common stock as to which dissenters’ rights are asserted. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of Ixia
common stock that are held of record in the name of another person, such as a broker or nominee, cannot enforce
dissenters’ rights directly and must act promptly to cause the holder of record to follow all of the steps summarized below
properly and in a timely manner to perfect such person’s dissenters’ rights.

ANY HOLDER OF SHARES OF IXIA COMMON STOCK WISHING TO EXERCISE DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS IS
URGED TO CONSULT LEGAL COUNSEL BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO EXERCISE SUCH RIGHTS. FAILURE TO
COMPLY STRICTLY WITH ALL OF THE PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN CHAPTER 13 OF THE CGCL, WHICH
CONSISTS OF SECTIONS 1300-1313, MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF A SHAREHOLDER’S STATUTORY
DISSENTERS’ RIGHTS.

Under the CGCL, shares of Ixia common stock must satisfy each of the following requirements to qualify as dissenting shares:

• such shares of Ixia common stock must have been outstanding on March 13, 2017, the record date of the special meeting
to approve the Merger Proposal;

• such shares of Ixia common stock must have been voted “AGAINST” the Merger Proposal;

• the holder of such shares of Ixia common stock must make a written demand (as described below) which demand is
received by us or our transfer agent no later than on the date of the special meeting, that we purchase such shares of Ixia
common stock at the fair market value (as defined below);

• the holder of such shares of Ixia common stock must submit to us or our transfer agent, (A) if the shares are certificated
securities, the certificate(s) representing such shares for endorsement (as described below), or (B) if the shares are
uncertificated securities, written notice of the number of shares which the holder demands that Ixia purchase (as described
below); and

• the holder of such shares of Ixia common stock must comply with all other requirements set forth in Chapter 13 of the
CGCL.

If you desire to exercise dissenting shareholder rights and to receive the fair market value of your shares of Ixia common stock
instead of the merger consideration, your shares must be voted “AGAINST” the Merger

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Proposal. It will not be sufficient to abstain from voting or for your shares to be subject to a broker non-vote. If you return a signed
proxy without indicating your voting preference or with instructions to vote “FOR” the Merger Proposal, your shares of Ixia
common stock will be voted in favor of the Merger Proposal and you will lose any dissenting shareholder rights. A vote
“AGAINST” the Merger Proposal does not and will not, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for dissenting shareholder
rights within the meaning of Chapter 13 of the CGCL.

Pursuant to Sections 1300 through 1313 of the CGCL, holders of dissenting shares may require us to purchase their dissenting
shares for cash at a price equal to the fair market value of such shares determined as of the day of, and immediately prior to, the first
announcement of the terms of the merger (which occurred on the morning of January 30, 2017), excluding any appreciation or
depreciation as a consequence of the proposed Merger, but adjusted for any stock split, reverse stock split, or stock dividend that
becomes effective thereafter (“fair market value”). Shareholders should be aware that an investment banking opinion as to the
fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a transaction such as the merger is not an opinion as to, and
does not in any way address, fair market value for purposes of Chapter 13 of the CGCL.

By no later than the date of the special meeting to approve the Merger Proposal, Ixia or its transfer agent must have received
from any dissenting shareholder written demand that we purchase such shareholder’s dissenting shares at their fair market value,
which written demand will:

• state the number and class of dissenting shares held of record by such dissenting shareholder that the dissenting
shareholder demands that we purchase; and

• include a statement of what such dissenting shareholder claims to be the fair market value of the dissenting shares (which
will constitute an offer by the dissenting shareholder to sell the dissenting shares at such price).

The demand and statement should be delivered to Ixia or our transfer agent. If submitted to Ixia, the demand and statement are
required to be delivered to: Ixia, 26601 West Agoura Road, Calabasas, California 91302, Attention: Matthew S. Alexander,
Corporate Secretary.

Within ten days following approval of the Merger Proposal by the Ixia shareholders, we are required to mail a dissenter’s
notice to each Ixia shareholder who has made a written demand for dissenters’ rights pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CGCL and who
is entitled to dissenting shareholder rights. The dissenter’s notice from the Company must contain the following:

• a notice of the approval of the Merger Proposal;

• a statement of the price determined by us to represent the fair market value of dissenting shares (which will constitute an
offer by us to purchase such dissenting shares at such stated price, unless such shares lose their status as “dissenting
shares” under Section 1309 of the CGCL);

• a brief description of the procedure for such holders to exercise their rights as dissenting shareholders; and

• a copy of Sections 1300 through 1304 of Chapter 13 of the CGCL.

Within 30 days after the date on which the notice of the approval of the Merger Proposal by the Ixia shareholders is mailed to
dissenting shareholders, a dissenting shareholder must submit to Ixia or its transfer agent certificates representing any dissenting
shares that the dissenting shareholder demands we purchase, so that such dissenting shares may either be stamped or endorsed with
the statement that the shares are dissenting shares or be exchanged for certificates of appropriate denomination so stamped or
endorsed. If the dissenting shares are uncertificated, then such shareholder must provide written notice of the number of shares
which the shareholder demands that we purchase within 30 days after the date of the mailing of the notice of the approval of the
Merger Proposal. If submitted to Ixia, the Ixia certificates or notice are required to be delivered to: Ixia, 26601 West Agoura Road,
Calabasas, California, 91302 Attention: Matthew S. Alexander, Corporate Secretary.

If upon the dissenting shareholder’s surrender of the certificates representing the dissenting shares and/or the dissenting
shareholder’s written notice with respect to uncertificated dissenting shares, a dissenting shareholder and we agree upon the price to
be paid for the dissenting shares and agree that such shares are dissenting shares, then the agreed price is required by law to be paid
(with interest thereon at the legal rate on judgments from the

date of the agreement) to the dissenting shareholder within the period ending on the later of (i) 30 days after the date of such
agreement upon the price for the dissenting shares, or (ii) 30 days after any statutory or contractual conditions to the completion of
the merger are satisfied. In the case of certificated securities, such payment will be subject to surrender of the certificates
representing the dissenting shares. Any agreement fixing the fair market value of any dissenting shares as between Ixia and a
dissenting shareholder will be filed with Ixia’s secretary.

If a dissenting shareholder and we disagree as to the price for such dissenting shares or disagree as to whether such shares are
entitled to be classified as dissenting shares, such shareholder has the right to bring an action in the superior court of the proper
California county, within six months after the date on which the notice of the shareholders’ approval of the Merger Proposal is
mailed, to resolve such dispute. In such action, the court will determine whether the shares of Ixia common stock held by such
shareholder are dissenting shares and/or the fair market value of such shares of Ixia common stock. If both the status of the shares as
dissenting shares and the fair market value of such shares are at issue, the court will determine the status of the shares first.

In determining the fair market value of the dissenting shares, the court may appoint one or more impartial appraisers to make
the determination. Within a time fixed by the court, the appraiser, or if there is more than one appraiser, a majority of them, will
make and file a report with the court. If the appraiser(s) cannot determine the fair market value within ten days of appointment, or
within a longer time determined by the court, or the court does not confirm the report of the appraiser(s), then the court will
determine the fair market value. Upon a motion made by any party, the report will be submitted to the court and considered evidence
as the court considers relevant. The costs of the proceedings, including reasonable compensation to the appraiser(s) to be fixed by
the court, will be allocated between us and the dissenting shareholder(s) as the court deems equitable. However, if the appraisal of
the fair market value of our shares exceeds the price offered by us in the notice of approval of the Merger Proposal, then we will pay
the costs. If the fair market value of the shares awarded by the court exceeds 125% of the price offered by us, then the court may in
its discretion impose additional costs on us, including attorneys’ fees, fees of expert witnesses, and interest.

Our shareholders considering whether to exercise dissenters’ rights should consider that the fair market value of their shares of
Ixia common stock determined under Chapter 13 of the CGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the
consideration to be issued and paid in connection with the merger, as set forth in the merger agreement. Also, we reserve the right to
assert in any appraisal proceeding that, for purposes thereof, the fair market value of shares of Ixia common stock is less than the
value of the consideration to be issued and paid in connection with the merger, as set forth in the merger agreement. Our
shareholders considering whether to exercise dissenters’ rights should consult with their tax advisors for the specific tax
consequences of the exercise of dissenters’ rights.

Strict compliance with certain technical prerequisites is required to exercise dissenters’ rights. Our shareholders wishing to
exercise dissenters’ rights should consult with their own legal counsel in connection with compliance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL.
Any Ixia shareholder who fails to comply with the requirements of Chapter 13 of the CGCL, a copy of which is attached as Annex
D to this proxy statement, will forfeit the right to exercise dissenters’ rights and will, instead, receive the consideration to be issued
and paid in connection with the merger, as set forth in the merger agreement.

Except as expressly limited by Chapter 13 of the CGCL, holders of dissenting shares continue to have all the rights and
privileges incident to their shares until the fair market value of their shares is agreed upon or determined.

Dissenting shares lose their status as dissenting shares, and holders of dissenting shares cease to be entitled to require us to
purchase such shares, upon the happening of any of the following:

• the merger is abandoned;

• the dissenting shares are transferred before their submission to us for the required endorsement, if they are certificated
shares;

• the dissenting shareholder and we do not agree on the status of the shares as dissenting shares or do not agree on the
purchase price, but neither we nor the shareholder files a complaint or intervenes in a pending action within six months
after the date on which we mailed the notice that our shareholders have approved the Merger Proposal; or

Financing of the Merger

Consummation of the merger is not subject to Keysight’s ability to obtain financing. However, Keysight expects to obtain
financing for a portion of the consideration for the merger.

Keysight expects to finance the merger and related fees and expenses with a combination of cash on hand, the issuance of new
senior notes and/or equity securities, and borrowings under new or existing credit facilities. In the event that the sum of the proceeds
of such new senior notes, equity securities, and borrowings under new or existing credit facilities (limited to $170,000,000 in the
case of revolving borrowings) is less than $1,684,000,000, the difference will be available under the bridge facility described in
more detail below, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

On January 30, 2017, Keysight entered into the bridge commitment letter with Goldman Sachs Bank, BNP Paribas, and BNP
Paribas Securities Corp. pursuant to which Goldman Sachs Bank and BNP Paribas have each committed to provide, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in the bridge commitment letter, 50% of a 364-day $1,684,000,000 senior unsecured bridge facility.
The bridge facility is available to finance the merger and to pay related fees and expenses related thereto to the extent that Keysight
does not finance such consideration and fees and expenses through the issuance of new senior notes, equity securities, and
borrowings under new or existing credit facilities as described above. Goldman Sachs Bank and BNP Paribas Securities Corp. are
the joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners for the bridge facility, and Goldman Sachs Bank will be the administrative agent
thereof.

The bridge financing is conditioned on the execution by Keysight of a definitive bridge loan agreement and related agreements,
as well as other customary conditions, including, but not limited to:

• consummation of the merger substantially contemporaneously with the financing, without any amendment, waiver, or
other modification under the merger agreement that is materially adverse to the interests of the lenders under the bridge
facility;

• the absence of the occurrence of a material adverse effect (as defined in the merger agreement) on Ixia from January 30,
2017 through the date of closing of the merger;

• the repayment in full of all principal, premium, if any, interest, fees, and other amounts due or outstanding under Ixia’s
current credit agreement and all other third party indebtedness of Ixia that becomes due or otherwise defaults upon the
consummation of the merger;

• the accuracy of such of the representations and warranties made by or with respect to Ixia in the merger agreement as are
material to the interests of the lenders, but only to the extent that Keysight has the right to not consummate the merger or
to terminate its obligations or otherwise does not have an obligation to close the merger, in each case, under the merger
agreement as a result of an inaccuracy of such representations and warranties in the merger agreement; and

• the absence of a payment or bankruptcy or insolvency event of default under the definitive documentation for the bridge
facility.

If any portion of the bridge financing or other sources of funding becomes unavailable, and such portion is reasonably required
to fund the aggregate merger consideration and all fees and expenses payable by Keysight and Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, then Keysight and Merger Sub must use their reasonable best efforts to obtain
alternative financing in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration and all such fees and expenses.

Litigation Related to the Merger

Two purported class action complaints relating to the merger have been filed in the United States District court for the Central
District of California on behalf of putative classes of Ixia’s public shareholders. The first action was filed on February 23, 2017, and
is captioned Witmer v. Ixia, et al., Case No. 2:17-cv-01483. The second action was filed on March 8, 2017, and is captioned Krishna
v. Ixia, et al., Case No. 2:17-cv-01840. The actions name as defendants Ixia and its directors, as well as Keysight and Merger Sub.
The actions assert similar

claims relating to Ixia’s disclosures in connection with the merger. Both complaints allege, among other things, that Ixia omitted
material information with respect to the proposed merger from the preliminary proxy statement that it filed with the SEC on
February 15, 2017, in connection with the proposed merger and that, as a result, (i) Ixia and the members of the Ixia Board violated
Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and (ii) such directors, as well as Keysight and Merger
Sub, violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiff in the Witmer action seeks an order enjoining the proposed merger or, if
the merger is consummated, rescinding the merger or awarding rescissory damages; an order requiring that the directors disseminate
a revised proxy statement; and an award of the plaintiff's costs of the action, including reasonable attorneys' and experts' fees.
Plaintiff in the Krishna action seeks an order enjoining the proposed merger and awarding the plaintiff her costs of the action,
including reasonable attorneys' and experts' fees.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the merger agreement. The description in this section and
elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the merger agreement, a copy of
which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. This summary does
not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. We
encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as the rights and obligations of the parties thereto are
governed by the express terms of the merger agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy
statement.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

The following summary of the merger agreement, and the copy of the merger agreement attached as Annex A to this proxy
statement, are intended to provide information regarding the terms of the merger agreement and are not intended to provide any
factual information about Ixia or modify or supplement any factual disclosures about Ixia in its public reports filed with the SEC. In
particular, the merger agreement and the following summary are not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures
regarding any facts and circumstances relating to Ixia. The merger agreement contains representations and warranties made by, and
covenants of, Ixia, Keysight, and Merger Sub which were made only for purposes of the merger agreement and as of specified dates.
The representations, warranties, and covenants in the merger agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger
agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential
disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the merger agreement instead of establishing
these matters as facts, and may be subject to contractual standards of materiality or material adverse effect applicable to the
contracting parties that generally differ from those applicable to shareholders. In addition, information concerning the subject matter
of the representations, warranties, and covenants may change after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information
may or may not be fully reflected in Ixia’s public disclosures. Shareholders have limited third-party beneficiary rights under the
merger agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, and covenants or any descriptions thereof as
characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties thereto or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates.
Moreover, the description of the merger agreement below does not purport to describe all of the terms of such agreement and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Annex A and is
incorporated herein by reference.

The Merger; Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers

The merger agreement provides that Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Keysight formed on February 1, 2017, will be
merged with and into Ixia. Ixia will be the surviving corporation of the merger and continue its corporate existence as a wholly
owned subsidiary of Keysight. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub that are in effect immediately before the
effective time will become the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation, although the articles of
incorporation and bylaws will be amended to reflect the name of the surviving corporation as “Ixia.”

On February 2, 2017, Merger Sub, Keysight, and Ixia entered into a joinder, pursuant to which Merger Sub agreed to be bound
by the merger agreement and will be the Keysight subsidiary which will merge with and into Ixia.

The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective time will be the directors of the surviving corporation, and the
individuals appointed by Keysight prior to or as of the effective time will be the officers of the surviving corporation.

Effective Time

The closing of the merger will take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the third business day following the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), or at such place or such other time or date
as will be agreed in writing between Ixia and Keysight.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Keysight and Merger Sub will not be obligated to effect the closing prior to the fifth business day
following the day Ixia has provided to Keysight and Merger Sub certain required financial information.

The merger will be effective when Ixia and Merger Sub file an executed agreement of merger and officers’ certificates as
required by the CGCL with the Secretary of State of the State of California, as provided by the CGCL, or at such later time as may
be agreed by Ixia and Keysight and specified in the agreement of merger.

Merger Consideration

At the effective time, each share of Ixia common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
(other than shares owned by Keysight or Merger Sub, or by any subsidiary of Keysight, Merger Sub, or Ixia, which will be
cancelled, and other than dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of $19.65 per share
in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

Each share of Merger Sub common stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be
converted into one share of common stock of the surviving corporation, and such converted shares will thereafter constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the surviving corporation.

Treatment of Ixia Equity Awards

Ixia Stock Options. Each Ixia stock option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time will, at the effective time, automatically become fully vested (to the extent not then vested) and be cancelled in consideration
for the right to receive, following the effective time, a cash payment equal to the product of (a) the total number of shares of Ixia
common stock subject to such cancelled Ixia stock option immediately prior to the effective time and (b) the excess, if any, of (1)
the merger consideration of $19.65 per share over (2) the exercise price per share of such cancelled Ixia stock option, without
interest and as reduced by the amount of any tax withholding required by law. Each Ixia stock option with respect to which,
immediately prior to the effective time, the exercise price per share subject thereto is equal to or greater than $19.65 will be
cancelled at the effective time in exchange for no consideration.

Ixia Restricted Stock Unit Awards. At the effective time, each Ixia RSU will automatically become fully vested and be
cancelled in consideration for the right to receive, following the effective time, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the
product of (a) the total number of shares of Ixia common stock subject to such Ixia RSU immediately prior to the effective time and
(b) the merger consideration of $19.65 per share, without interest and as reduced by the amount of any tax withholding required by
law. If immediately prior to the effective time, an Ixia RSU remains subject to a performance-based vesting condition, such Ixia
PRSU will, at such time and in accordance with the terms thereof, become earned at the target performance level, and such Ixia
PRSU will, at the effective time, become fully vested and be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive, following the
effective time, a cash payment with respect thereto that is the same as the cash payment described in the preceding sentence for
other Ixia RSUs that are cancelled at the effective time.

Ixia, as the surviving corporation in the merger, will cause the option payments and the RSU payments to be paid, less any
required tax withholdings, as promptly as practicable following the effective time (and not later than the first regularly scheduled
payroll date on or after the fifth business day after the effective time) through its payroll systems.

Treatment of Ixia Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Commencing on January 30, 2017, the Ixia ESPP ceased to accept any new participants, and no participant in the Ixia ESPP is
permitted to alter his or her contributions after such date (other than to discontinue participation in the Ixia ESPP). No new offering
periods may be commenced under the Ixia ESPP after January 30, 2017, and any offering periods in effect as of January 30, 2017
will be terminated effective as of (a) the last day of the current purchase period or (b) if earlier, prior to the effective time, and all
amounts then credited to the accounts of participants will be used to purchase shares of Ixia common stock in accordance with the
terms of the Ixia ESPP. All accumulated contributions of each participant as of the termination of the Ixia ESPP that are not used to
purchase shares of Ixia common stock pursuant to the Ixia ESPP will be returned to the participants, without interest. The Ixia ESPP
will terminate as of the effective time.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Payment Procedures

At the closing, Keysight will deposit funds with a paying agent selected by Keysight and reasonably acceptable to Ixia in an
amount necessary for the payment of the aggregate merger consideration.

Within three business days after the effective time, the paying agent will mail to each holder of record of certificates
representing Ixia common stock immediately prior to the effective time (other than holders who properly exercise (and have not
withdrawn or lost) their dissenters’ rights) a letter of transmittal and instructions for surrendering such certificates. Upon surrender
of any certificate to the paying agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, the holder of such certificate will be
entitled to receive the merger consideration in cash for each share of Ixia common stock represented by such certificate, without
interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

If any certificate representing Ixia common stock has been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed, and, if required by Keysight or the paying agent, the
posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as Keysight or the paying agent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the surviving corporation, the paying agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen, or destroyed certificate the merger consideration for each share of Ixia common stock represented by such lost, stolen, or
destroyed certificate, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

Any holder of shares of Ixia common stock in book-entry form is not required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the paying agent. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more shares of Ixia common stock in book-entry
form (other than holders who properly exercise (and have not withdrawn or lost) their dissenters’ rights) will, upon receipt by the
paying agent of an “agent’s message” in customary form, be entitled to receive the merger consideration for each such share of Ixia
common stock, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

Any cash deposited with the paying agent that remains unclaimed for nine months after the effective time will be delivered to
the surviving corporation, and any holders of Ixia common stock who have not complied with the exchange procedures in the
merger agreement will thereafter look only to the surviving corporation for payment of the merger consideration.

Representations and Warranties

The merger agreement contains customary representations and warranties made by Ixia that are subject, in some cases, to
specific exceptions and qualifications contained in the merger agreement, Ixia’s SEC filings, and the matters contained in the
disclosure letter delivered by Ixia to Keysight in connection with the merger agreement (the “disclosure letter”). These
representations and warranties relate to, among other things:

• due organization, good standing, and corporate power;

• authority with respect to the execution and delivery of the merger agreement;

• absence of conflicts with, or violations of, organizational documents, applicable laws and contracts, and required consents
of governmental authorities;

The merger agreement also contains customary representations and warranties made by Keysight that are subject to specified
exceptions and qualifications contained in the merger agreement. The representations and warranties of Keysight to Ixia under the
merger agreement, relate to, among other things:

• due organization, good standing, and corporate power;

The representations and warranties of each of the parties to the merger agreement will expire upon the effective time.

Many of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement made by Ixia are qualified by a “materiality” or “material
adverse effect” standard (that is, they will not be deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct,
individually or in the aggregate, would, as the case may be, be material or have a material adverse effect). For purposes of the
merger agreement, a “material adverse effect” with respect to Ixia means any changes, effects, events, occurrences, states of facts, or
developments that (a) have had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of
operations, assets, or financial condition of Ixia and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (b) would prevent, materially impair or
materially delay the performance by Ixia of, or has or would have a material adverse effect on the ability of Ixia to perform, its
obligations under the merger agreement, other than, in the cause of the foregoing clause (a), any change, effect, event, occurrence,
state of facts, or development to the extent arising from or attributable to:

• the execution, delivery, announcement, or pendency of the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement, including (a) the identity of Keysight and (b) the impact thereof on the relationships, contractual or
otherwise, of Ixia or any of its subsidiaries with its customers, employees, or suppliers, or with any other third party;

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• changes in business or political conditions or conditions generally affecting the industry or segments in which Ixia and its
subsidiaries participate, the U.S. economy as a whole or the capital, credit, or financial markets in general or the markets
in which Ixia and its subsidiaries operate;

• compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any action required by, the merger agreement (including any change, effect,
event, occurrence, state of facts, or development arising from any actions or omissions required to comply with  Ixia’s
operating covenants during the pendency of the merger contained in the merger agreement only to the extent that such
change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts, or development is the direct result of Keysight unreasonably withholding
its consent to Ixia’s written request to take (or refrain from taking) an action otherwise prohibited under such operating
covenants);

• any change after the date of the merger agreement in GAAP or applicable laws or the interpretation or enforcement
thereof;

• any acts of war (whether or not declared), armed hostilities, sabotage, or terrorism occurring after the date of the merger

• the failure of Ixia or any of its subsidiaries to meet internal forecasts, budgets, or financial projections or any decline in the
market price or trading volume of Ixia common stock on NASDAQ (it being understood that any change, effect, event,
occurrence, state of facts, or development underlying such failure or decline may, if they are not otherwise excluded from
the definition, be taken into account in determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred);

provided, however, that the exceptions provided in the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth bullet points above will be taken into account
in determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur to the extent any change,
effect, event, occurrence, state of facts, or development has a materially disproportionate effect on Ixia and its subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, relative to other persons in the industry in which Ixia operates.

Covenants Relating to Conduct of Business Pending the Closing

Under the merger agreement, Ixia agreed that, subject to certain exceptions in the merger agreement and the disclosure letter
delivered by Ixia in connection with the merger agreement, between the date of the merger agreement and the earlier of the
termination of the merger agreement and the effective time, unless Keysight gives its prior written consent (which may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), Ixia will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, conduct its business in all
material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and use commercially reasonable efforts to
preserve intact its current business organization, assets, technology, and franchises, keep available the services of its employees,
maintain in effect all of its material permits, and maintain relationships with its significant customers, suppliers, and distributors,
and others having significant business relations with them.

obligations, that the Ixia board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel)
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal, Ixia will give Keysight written notice promptly after the
Ixia board makes such determination (and in no event later than twenty-four hours after such determination), and Ixia may (a)

that all such information, to the extent not previously provided to Keysight, is provided to Keysight substantially concurrently with
the time it is provided to such person), and (b) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such acquisition
proposal regarding such acquisition proposal.

Ixia must notify Keysight promptly (but in no event later than twenty-four hours) after receipt by Ixia of any acquisition

access to the business, properties, assets, books, or records of Ixia or any of its subsidiaries by any person that to the knowledge of
Ixia may be considering making, or has made, an acquisition proposal, which notice will be provided orally and in writing and will
provide the material terms and conditions of, any such acquisition proposal, indication, or request (including the identity of the
person making any such acquisition proposal, indication, or request, and copies of any related documentation, including any related
financing commitments). Thereafter, Ixia will keep Keysight informed in writing on a reasonably current basis of the status of, and

tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes an acquisition proposal and affirm the Ixia board’s recommendation of the merger
agreement, within ten business days after such tender offer or exchange offer is first published, or approve, adopt, or recommend
any acquisition proposal (any such action being referred to in this proxy statement as an “adverse recommendation change”), or (b)
approve, adopt, or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, adopt, or recommend, or allow Ixia or any of its subsidiaries to
execute or enter into any alternative acquisition agreement.

If at any time prior to obtaining the requisite Ixia shareholder approval, a written bona fide acquisition proposal is made and
did not result from a breach by Ixia or its representatives of the non-solicitation obligations, and the Ixia board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes a superior
proposal and the failure to approve or recommend such superior proposal would be inconsistent with the Ixia board’s fiduciary
duties under applicable law, the Ixia board may make an adverse recommendation change, and/or Ixia may terminate the merger
agreement, pay the Company termination fee (described below), and concurrently enter into a definitive alternative acquisition
agreement with respect to such superior proposal, subject to compliance with the relevant requirements under the merger agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Ixia board will not make an adverse recommendation change and Ixia will not be entitled to
terminate the merger agreement unless:

• Ixia provides Keysight at least five business days’ prior written notice advising Keysight that it intends to take such action;

• if requested by Keysight, Ixia negotiates with Keysight in good faith during such five business day period concerning any
revisions to the terms of the merger agreement that Keysight proposes in response to such superior proposal; and

• the Ixia board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such
acquisition proposal continues to constitute a superior proposal, after giving due consideration to any changes proposed to
be made to the merger agreement by Keysight in writing. Any revisions to the financial terms or any other material terms
of a superior proposal will require Ixia to deliver to Keysight a new written notice and a new five business day period will
commence thereafter (provided that such new notice period will be shortened to three business days if the only change to
the material terms of such superior proposal is an increase in the merger consideration).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The term “acquisition proposal” as used in this proxy statement means any proposal or offer with respect to (a) a merger,
consolidation or other business combination, tender offer, exchange offer, or any transaction involving the purchase or acquisition of
20% or more of the shares of Ixia common stock, including as a result of a primary issuance of Ixia common stock, or (b) a direct or
indirect purchase or acquisition of 20% or more of the assets or businesses of Ixia and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

The term “superior proposal” as used in this proxy statement means any bona fide acquisition proposal (with all references to
“20%” in the definition of acquisition proposal being treated as references to “75%”) which the Ixia board concludes in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory, and other
aspects of the acquisition proposal and the person making the acquisition proposal, (a) is on terms more favorable to Ixia’s
shareholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement (after giving effect to any
proposed changes by Keysight), (b) is reasonably likely to be completed on a timely basis and does not contain any conditionality
that is related to completion of due diligence or having obtained financing for the superior proposal, and (c) the financing of which
is fully committed.

The Ixia board may also make an adverse recommendation change if an intervening event has occurred prior to the time the
requisite Ixia shareholder approval is obtained, if:

• the Ixia board concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Ixia board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law;

• Ixia provides Keysight at least five business days’ prior written notice advising Keysight that it intends to take such action,
which notice must specify the material facts and circumstances (based on information reasonably available) related to such
intervening event;

• if requested by Keysight, Ixia negotiates in good faith during such five business day period with Keysight concerning any
revisions to the terms of the merger agreement that Keysight proposes; and

• the Ixia board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the
failure to make an adverse recommendation change would be inconsistent with the Ixia board’s fiduciary duties under
applicable law, after giving due consideration to any changes proposed to be made to the merger agreement by Keysight in
writing.

The term “intervening event” as used in this proxy statement means any material change, effect, event, occurrence, state of
facts, or development arising after the date of the merger agreement, that (a) was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the
Ixia board, or the material consequences of which were not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Ixia board, in each case as of
or prior to the date of the merger agreement, (b) becomes known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Ixia board prior to the time the
requisite Ixia shareholder approval is obtained, and (c) does not involve or relate to (i) an acquisition proposal or a superior proposal
or (ii) any fluctuation in the market price or trading volume of Ixia common stock, in and of itself.

Shareholder Meeting; Preparation of the Proxy Statement

Ixia has agreed to call a meeting of its shareholders to be held as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within
35 calendar days) after the mailing of the definitive proxy statement. Ixia must use its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in
favor of approving the merger agreement and the principal terms of the merger. Unless required by law, Ixia may postpone or
adjourn the shareholders meeting for a limited amount of time only for the absence of a quorum, or to allow additional solicitation
of votes in order to obtain the requisite Ixia shareholder approval. Ixia has also agreed for the Ixia board to recommend to Ixia’s
shareholders the approval of the merger agreement and the principal terms of the merger, subject to the provisions of the merger
agreement described above under “—Non-Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals; Change in Recommendation” beginning on page 68
of this proxy statement.

Employee Matters

The merger agreement provides that, for a period of one year following the effective time, Keysight will provide each
employee of Ixia and its subsidiaries who remains in the active employment of the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries
(referred to in this proxy statement, collectively, as “continuing employees”)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(a) an annual rate of salary or wages and annual incentive opportunities that are, in each case, no less favorable than that provided to
such employee as of the date of the merger agreement, and (b) employee benefits, that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to the
employee benefits provided to such employee as of the date of the merger agreement. In addition, the flexible spending accounts
maintained under Ixia’s cafeteria plan will continue to be maintained through a date ending no earlier than the last day of the
calendar year in which the effective time occurs, unless such accounts are merged into successor arrangements maintained by the
surviving corporation.

Keysight will cause the surviving corporation to recognize the service of each continuing employee with Ixia or its subsidiaries
(as well as service with any predecessor employer of Ixia or its subsidiaries to the extent service with such predecessor employer is
recognized by Ixia or its subsidiaries) as if such service had been performed with Keysight with respect to any vacation or severance
plans, policies, or programs in which continuing employees are eligible to participate after the effective time for all purposes under
such vacation or severance plans, policies, or programs, except, in each case, to the extent such treatment would result in duplicative
benefits.

With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Keysight in which continuing employees are eligible to participate after the
effective time, subject to certain customary exclusions, Keysight will take commercially reasonable efforts to, or to cause the
surviving corporation to, (a) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions and limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements, waiting periods, and any other restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under any welfare benefit
plan with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such conditions and
exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans or comparable welfare plans maintained by
Ixia prior to the effective time, and (b) provide each continuing employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in
the same plan year in which the effective time occurs in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the
extent applicable under the relevant welfare benefit plan in which continuing employees participate from and after the effective
time, as if there had been a single continuous employer, to the extent credited under the welfare plans maintained by Ixia prior to the
effective time. Such credited expenses, if any, will count toward any annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar
limitations that apply under the terms of the applicable plan.

Prior to the closing date of the merger, Keysight may cause Ixia to terminate its 401(k) plan, effective as of the day prior to the
closing of the merger. Following the effective time, and as soon as practicable following a favorable determination letter from the
IRS on the termination of the Ixia 401(k) plan, the assets will be distributed to participants and the continuing employees who are at
the time actively employed may, to the extent permitted by Keysight’s applicable 401(k) plan, rollover the full account balance
(excluding loans) distributed to such employee from the Ixia 401(k) plan into the applicable Keysight 401(k) plan.

The provisions of the merger agreement described above are for the sole benefit of the parties to the merger agreement.
Nothing contained in any of these provisions, expressed or implied, confers upon or gives to any person (including for the avoidance
of doubt any current or former employees, directors or independent contractors of any of Ixia or its subsidiaries, Keysight or its
subsidiaries or, on or after the effective time, the surviving corporation or its subsidiaries), other than the parties to the merger
agreement, any legal, equitable or other rights or remedies.

Indemnification and Insurance

For six years after the effective time, Keysight will cause the surviving corporation (a) to include and cause to be maintained in
effect in the surviving corporation’s (or any successor’s) organizational documents provisions regarding elimination of liability of
directors, and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to directors and officers of Ixia, no less favorable than those
contained in Ixia’s organizational documents as of the date of the merger agreement, in favor of all past and present directors and
officers of Ixia and its subsidiaries (referred to in this proxy statement, collectively, as “indemnified parties”) in connection with acts
or omissions occurring on or prior to the effective time, and (b) to honor Ixia’s obligations under its organizational documents and
certain indemnification agreements.

Prior to the effective time, Ixia will, and, if Ixia is unable to, Keysight will cause the surviving corporation to, obtain and fully
pay for, at no expense to the beneficiaries, non-cancellable “tail” insurance policies with a claims period of six years from and after
the effective time with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability

insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies, for current directors and officers, with terms, conditions, retentions, and
levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured individuals as Ixia’s existing policy, with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the effective time (including in connection with the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated
thereby). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount paid for such tail policy will not exceed 250% of the amount Ixia paid for its
existing policy in its last full fiscal year.

Efforts to Obtain Regulatory Approvals

Subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, Keysight and Ixia will use their reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable but subject to certain limitations described below, (a) consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement, (b) obtain from any governmental authority any consent, approval, authorization, waiver, or order required to
be obtained or made by any party, and avoid any action by any governmental authority, in connection with the merger and to fulfill
the conditions to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and (c) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any
other required submissions, required under applicable law, including antitrust laws, in connection with the merger and to fulfill the
conditions to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Keysight and Ixia will cooperate with each other in
connection with obtaining all such consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers, or orders and the making of all such filings.

Keysight and Ixia have agreed to make (a) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement as promptly as practicable and in any event within twelve
business days after the date of the merger agreement, and (b) appropriate filings, if any are required, pursuant to foreign antitrust
laws as promptly as practicable. Keysight and Ixia will comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under the HSR Act
or any other antitrust laws to provide information, documents, or other materials requested by any governmental authority. Each of
Keysight and Ixia filed their notification forms with the FTC and DOJ under the HSR Act on February 15, 2017, and, in accordance
with the merger agreement, each requested “early termination” of the waiting period.

Keysight and Ixia will use reasonable best efforts to take all other actions and do all other things necessary, proper, or advisable
to resolve such objections, if any, as any governmental authority may assert under the HSR Act or any other antitrust laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and avoid
the institution of any action under any such law that may be asserted by any governmental authority, including by (a) proposing,
negotiating, committing to, and effecting the sale, divestiture, or disposition of any assets or businesses of Keysight or its affiliates
or Ixia or its subsidiaries, (b) terminating existing, or creating new, relationships, contractual rights, or obligations of Keysight or its
affiliates or Ixia or its subsidiaries, or (c) effectuating any other change or restructuring of Keysight or its affiliates or Ixia or its
subsidiaries or otherwise taking any actions that limit the freedom of action of Keysight or its affiliates or Ixia or its subsidiaries
with respect to one or more assets or businesses, to ensure that no governmental authority enters any order or establishes any law
preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining, or prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such action will be (i) required to be proposed, agreed to, or taken by Keysight or its
affiliates except to the extent necessary to permit the consummation of the merger to occur before October 30, 2017, (ii) required
unless contingent upon the occurrence of the merger, or (iii) required to be proposed, agreed to, or taken by Keysight or its affiliates
if such action would have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, or financial condition of (x) Ixia and its
subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or (y) Keysight and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole, after giving effect to the merger).

Keysight and Ixia will cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any action, and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed, or overturned any order (whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent) that is threatened or in effect and that
restricts, prevents, or prohibits consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement under the HSR Act or any
other antitrust laws, including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal.

Keysight will not, and will not permit any of its affiliates to, effect any acquisition, business combination, or similar
transaction, or enter into any agreement to effect any acquisition, business combination, or similar transaction, that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or materially and adversely affect Keysight’s ability to satisfy the conditions to the
merger relating to antitrust laws.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Other Covenants

Access to Information

Ixia will provide Keysight and its representatives reasonable access at reasonable times, and upon reasonable notice, to the
books and records and properties of Ixia and its subsidiaries and any financial, operating and other data and information regarding
the assets, properties, or business of Ixia and its subsidiaries as Keysight may from time to time reasonably request, except that (i)
such access or information requests do not unreasonably interfere with the operation of Ixia’s and its subsidiaries’ business and such
access to the properties of Ixia and its subsidiaries will be subject to their respective reasonable security measures and insurance
requirements, (ii) Keysight and its representatives will not contact or otherwise communicate with Ixia’s customers or suppliers
(other than contact or other communications with such customers or suppliers in the ordinary course of business and not related to
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement), (iii) such access will not require Ixia or its subsidiaries to allow any
environmental testing or sampling, and (iv) Ixia is not required to provide Keysight with access to information that would be subject
to an attorney-client or other legal privilege, or violate any applicable law (but Ixia and Keysight will reasonably cooperate to cause
such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to waive the applicable privilege or protection
or violate the applicable law).

Public Announcements

Subject to certain exceptions described in the merger agreement, Keysight and Ixia will consult with each other before issuing
any press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and will not
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably
conclude may be required by applicable law or rules of securities exchanges on which the securities of such party are listed.

Financing Efforts

Keysight has agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the financing, including using its reasonable best efforts
to (a) maintain in effect the bridge commitment letter, (b) satisfy all conditions in the commitment letter to obtaining the financing
as promptly as practicable (taking into account the expected timing of the effective time), (c) as promptly as practicable (taking into
account the expected timing of the effective time), negotiate, execute, and deliver definitive documentation with respect to the
financing on the terms and subject to the conditions contemplated by the commitment letter, and (d) cause the financing sources to
fund the financing on or prior to the closing date. If any portion of the financing becomes unavailable, and such portion is
reasonably required to fund the aggregate merger consideration, Keysight will use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration.

Ixia has also agreed to provide customary cooperation reasonably requested by Keysight that is necessary in connection with
the arrangement and consummation of the financing, including (a) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, due diligence
sessions, drafting sessions, and sessions between senior management and the financing sources, (b) promptly providing to Keysight
certain required financial information, and such other pertinent information and financial data relating to Ixia and its subsidiaries as
may be reasonably available to Ixia and which is reasonably requested by Keysight in connection with the preparation of one or
more bank information memoranda and packages, lender and investor presentations, rating agency materials, private placement
memoranda, offering memoranda, prospectuses, and similar documents customary in order to consummate the financing or that
would be necessary to obtain a consent from or receive customary “comfort” letters from the independent registered public
accounting firm of Ixia, and cooperating with Keysight in preparing such pro forma financial statements and other pro forma
financial data and financial information, and (c) providing reasonable and customary assistance with the preparation of certain
documents customarily required in connection with the financing.

The receipt or availability of any financing by or to Keysight is not a condition to any of the obligations of Keysight under the
merger agreement.

Other Covenants and Agreements

The merger agreement also contains additional covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to reporting
requirements under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the treatment of certain indebtedness, efforts to

Effect of Termination

If the merger agreement is terminated, it will become null and void and of no effect without liability or obligation on the part of
any party, except with respect to certain provisions which will remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
party will remain liable for any liabilities or damages resulting from any fraud or any willful breach (as defined in the merger
agreement) by such party prior to such termination (subject to certain limitations).

Transaction Expenses

Each party will generally pay its own fees and expenses in connection with the merger. Keysight will pay all filing fees payable

thereof, or (c) by Keysight because of a violation or breach of the merger agreement by Ixia which has prevented or would
prevent the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Keysight and Merger Sub to complete the merger, and in any

would be satisfied if the closing were to occur on the date of such notice), and Ixia stands ready, willing, and able to complete the
merger at such time, and (c) Keysight fails to complete the merger by the third business day after the later of delivery of such notice
and the date on which the closing should have occurred under the terms of the merger agreement.

Limitation on Remedies

Upon termination of the merger agreement, Keysight’s and Ixia’s rights, if any, to receive the applicable termination fee
described above will be the sole and exclusive remedy of Keysight, Merger Sub, and Ixia against the other parties for any loss
suffered as a result of any breach of the merger agreement or the failure of the merger to be completed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no party will be relieved from any liabilities or damages resulting from any fraud or willful breach (as defined in the
merger agreement) committed by such party prior to such termination, except in the case of a termination of the merger agreement
by Ixia entitling Ixia to receive the termination fee from Keysight described above.

Amendment

The parties may amend the merger agreement at any time, either before or after the Ixia shareholder approval, by written
agreement. However, after such shareholder approval, no amendment may be made which requires further approval by such
shareholders under applicable law without such further approval.

Third Party Beneficiaries

The merger agreement is not intended to and does not confer upon any person other than the parties to the merger agreement
any rights or remedies, except:

• the rights of the indemnified persons to enforce the obligations described under “—Indemnification and Insurance;”

• the right of Ixia’s shareholders to enforce Keysight’s obligation to pay the merger consideration; and

• other rights expressly set out in the merger agreement.

Specific Performance

The parties to the merger agreement have agreed that irreparable harm would occur if any of the provisions of the merger
agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise breached. The parties
agreed that each party is entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms of the merger agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ixia is not entitled to obtain specific performance of Keysight’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to
consummate the merger unless (a) all of the conditions to the obligations of Keysight and Merger Sub to complete the merger are
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the closing itself, but subject to
satisfaction thereof if the closing were to occur at that time), (b) the financing has been funded or will be funded at the closing, (c)
Keysight has failed to close within three business days after the later of the date the closing should occur in accordance with the
terms of the merger agreement and receipt of the written confirmation described in the following clause (d), and (d) Ixia has
confirmed to Keysight in writing that if specific performance is granted and the financing is funded, and Keysight otherwise
complies with its obligations under the merger agreement, then the closing will occur. Under no circumstances will Ixia be permitted
or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of Keysight’s obligation to consummate the merger and a payment of the
Keysight termination fee.

Governing Law

The merger agreement and its enforcement will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, provided that (a) the merger
and the exercise of the dissenters’ rights with respect to the merger will be governed by the laws of the State of California and (b)
any action against any financing source will be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

THE VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENTS

The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Voting and Support Agreements. The description in this
section and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Voting and Support
Agreements, a form of which is attached as Annex B and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. This summary does
not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the Voting and Support Agreements that is important to
you. We encourage you to read the form of Voting and Support Agreement carefully and in its entirety.

In connection with the execution of the merger agreement, the Company and Keysight have entered into a Voting and Support
Agreement, dated as of January 30, 2017 (each, a “support agreement”), with each of (i) Laurent Asscher and Katelia Capital Group
Ltd. and (ii) Errol Ginsberg and The Errol Ginsberg and Annette R. Michelson Family Trust dated October 13, 1999 (the persons
referenced in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the “Company major shareholders”). Mr. Asscher is member of the Ixia board, and
Errol Ginsberg is the Chairman of the Ixia board and our Chief Innovation Officer.

Pursuant to the support agreements, the Company major shareholders have agreed, among other things, that subject to the
terms and conditions of the support agreements, at any meeting of Ixia’s shareholders, or in connection with any written consent of
Ixia’s shareholders, the Company major shareholders will each (i) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause all the shares of Ixia
common stock which they beneficially own as of the applicable record date to be counted as present at the meeting for purposes of
calculating a quorum, and (ii) vote or cause to be voted (including by proxy or written consent, if applicable) all such beneficially
owned shares (A) in favor of the approval of the merger agreement and the principal terms of the merger, (B) in favor of any
proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting of Ixia’s shareholders to a later date if such adjournment or postponement, subject to
certain limitations in the support agreement, (C) against any action, proposal, transaction, or agreement in favor of an acquisition
proposal, including a superior proposal, without regard to the terms of such acquisition proposal or superior proposal, (D) against
any merger, consolidation, business combination, sale of assets, reorganization, or recapitalization of or involving the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, (E) against any sale, lease, or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, (F) against any reorganization, recapitalization, extraordinary dividend, dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, (G) against any material change in the capitalization of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
or the corporate structure of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (H) to the extent submitted to a shareholder vote, against any
change in the Ixia management or Ixia board (other than as directed by Keysight), and (I) against any action, proposal, transaction,
or agreement that is intended to or would (1) result in an inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, or a breach of any covenant,
or any other obligation or agreement, of the Company contained in the merger agreement, or of a shareholder contained in the
support agreement, or (2) prevent, materially impede, materially delay or otherwise materially and adversely affect the Company’s,
Keysight’s, or Merger Sub’s ability to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the
merger.

The support agreements will terminate, and the above obligations will cease, upon the earliest to occur of (i) the consummation
of the merger, (ii) the termination of the merger agreement pursuant to and in compliance with the terms therein, (iii) the Ixia board
effecting an adverse recommendation change (as defined in the merger agreement), and (iv) the entry, by the parties to the merger
agreement and without the prior written consent of the Company major shareholders, into any amendment or modification of the
merger agreement, or any written waiver of the Company’s rights under the merger agreement made in connection with a request
from Keysight, in each case, which results in a decrease in, or change in the composition of, the merger consideration payable to any
Company major shareholder.

The support agreements provide that the Company major shareholders will not and will use such shareholder’s reasonable best
efforts to cause its affiliates and its and their other representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly
encourage, or knowingly facilitate any acquisition proposal or any inquiry or other action that would reasonably be expected to lead
to or result in an acquisition proposal, (ii) enter into, continue, or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding
or in connection with or reasonably expected to lead to or result in an acquisition proposal, other than to inform any person of the
existence of the provisions contained in such no solicitation provision, or (iii) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing; provided
that nothing will prohibit any Company major shareholder or any of its affiliates or

representatives from participating in any discussions or negotiations with respect to such shareholder’s willingness to enter into a
voting agreement in connection with an acquisition proposal to the extent that the Company becomes permitted to take the actions
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement.

The Company major shareholders also granted a proxy to Keysight that is irrevocable to vote the shares of Ixia common stock
that the Company major shareholders own on the record date at the special meeting, unless the support agreement is terminated. In
addition, prior to the termination of the support agreements, subject to certain limited exceptions, the Company major shareholders
are prohibited from directly or indirectly (i) selling, transferring, encumbering, hypothecating, or similarly disposing of, or entering
into any contract, option, or other arrangement or understanding providing for the transfer of any Ixia common stock, (ii) depositing
any securities into a voting trust, or entering into a voting agreement or arrangement, or granting any proxy or power of attorney
with respect thereto, or (iii) agreeing to take any of the foregoing actions.

As of March 13, 2017, the record date, the signatories to the support agreements held voting power over approximately 21.7%
of Ixia common stock outstanding.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

As of the date of this proxy statement, the Ixia board knows of no matters that will be presented for consideration at the special
meeting other than as described in this proxy statement.

If the merger is consummated, we will not have public shareholders and there will be no public participation in any future
shareholder meetings. We intend to hold an annual meeting of shareholders in 2017 (the “2017 annual meeting”) only if the merger
is not consummated, or if we are otherwise required to do so under applicable law.

Requirements for Shareholder Proposals to be Considered for Inclusion in our Proxy Materials. Proposals of shareholders of
Ixia which are intended to be presented by such shareholders at the 2017 annual meeting, if the merger is not consummated prior to
the meeting, must have been received by us no later than on December 29, 2016 to be considered for inclusion in the Company’s
proxy materials relating to such meeting and must have been submitted in accordance with Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the
Exchange Act. However, if the date of the 2017 annual meeting is more than 30 days after June 2, 2017, the proposal must be
received a reasonable time before we begin to print and mail our proxy materials in order to be included in our proxy statement and
form of proxy for the meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

Other Shareholder Proposals. In addition, shareholder proposals that are not intended for inclusion in our proxy materials may
be brought before the 2017 annual meeting, if the merger is not consummated, if the Company receives advance notice in
accordance with the requirements set forth in our bylaws. Any such notice must have been received by the Corporate Secretary of
the Company no later than March 4, 2017 to be considered timely for the 2017 annual meeting; provided, however, that if the date
of the 2017 annual meeting is more than 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the Company’s 2016 annual meeting, we
must receive written notice of such matters not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which notice of
the date of the 2017 annual meeting is mailed to shareholders or otherwise publicly disclosed. Proxies solicited by Ixia management
may confer discretionary authority to vote on matters which are not included in the proxy statement but which are raised at the 2017
annual meeting, unless we receive written notice of such matters by the applicable deadline.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HOUSEHOLDING

The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (such as brokerage firms, banks, and other nominees) to
implement a delivery procedure called “householding.” Under this procedure, multiple shareholders who reside at the same address
may receive a single copy of our proxy materials and annual reports unless an affected shareholder has provided contrary
instructions. This procedure reduces printing costs and postage fees.

If you are the beneficial owner of shares of Ixia common stock and you share an address with other beneficial owners, then
your brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee may have delivered for all beneficial owners sharing your address a single copy of this
proxy statement (unless the beneficial owner had already asked the brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee for separate copies). To
make a written or oral request for an individual copy of this proxy statement, please contact us at: Ixia, Attention Brent T. Novak,
Chief Financial Officer, 26601 West Agoura Road, Calabasas, California 91302; Telephone 818-871-1800. We will promptly deliver

cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the “Surviving Corporation”). As a result of the Merger,

Section 2.02.   Closing.   The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the third
Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefits
thereof of the conditions set forth in  Article 6 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at
the Closing itself, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions), by electronic
exchange of documents, or at such place or such other time or date as shall be agreed in writing between Parent and the Company;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the Party or Parties entitled
to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in Article 6, Parent and Merger Sub shall not be obligated to effect the Closing
prior to the fifth (5th) Business Day following the day the Company has provided to Parent and Merger Sub the Required
Information, unless Parent shall provide written notice of an earlier date (but, subject in each such case, to the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by Law) waiver by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefits thereof of all of the conditions set forth in Article 6
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing itself, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions); provided further, if the Required Information is deemed
not to have been provided as a result of a Required Information Trigger Event during the period between the provision of such
Required Information and the Closing, a new five (5) Business Day period shall commence upon cure of the applicable Required
Information Trigger Event as indicated therein. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the
“Closing Date.”

Section 2.03.   Effective Time.   As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Parties shall (a) cause an agreement of merger

and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of California (the “California Secretary”), together with the officers’ certificates

the California Secretary or on such later date and time as shall be agreed to by the Company and Parent and specified in the
Agreement of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the “Effective Time”), it being understood and agreed
that the Parties shall cause the Effective Time to occur on the Closing Date.

Section 2.04.   Effects of the Merger.   The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and specified in the
applicable provisions of the CGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all

Corporation and all debts, liabilities, and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.05.   Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(a)   At the Effective Time, the amended and restated articles of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be amended and restated to be the articles of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (provided that the name of the Surviving Corporation will be “Ixia”), and as so amended and restated shall thereafter
be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and as provided
by applicable Law (subject to  Section 5.06).

(b)   At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended
and restated to be the bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (provided that the name of the

until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms and as provided by applicable Law (subject to  Section 5.06).

Section 2.06.   Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.   From and after the Effective Time, until successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable Law, (a) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to

Section 2.07.   Conversion of Company Common Stock.   At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, or the Company or any holder of any securities of any of the foregoing:

(a)   Capital Stock of Merger Sub.   Each share of common stock of Merger Sub, without par value, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, without par value.

(b)   Cancellation of Parent-Owned Company Common Stock.   Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common
Stock that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub, or by any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, or the Company, immediately prior to
the Effective Time (except to the extent held by any such Person on behalf of a third party) (collectively, the “Excluded Shares”),
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no cash, stock, or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable
in exchange therefor.

(c)   Conversion of Company Common Stock.   Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall automatically be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive cash in an amount, without interest, equal to $19.65 (the “Per Share Merger Consideration”). As of the Effective
Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares (a “Certificate”) or book-entry shares (“Book-Entry
Shares”) (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except, in all
cases, the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, in accordance with  Section 2.08. The right of any
holder of any share of Company Common Stock to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by
the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable Tax Law.

(d)   Company Equity Awards.   The Company shall take all requisite action so that:

      (i)   Treatment of Company Stock Options.   Each option (or portion thereof) to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock under the Company Equity Plan (“Company Stock Option”), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, automatically and without any required action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or any holder thereof or any other Person, become fully vested and be cancelled in consideration for the right to
receive a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such cancelled Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of (1) the Per
Share Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise price per share subject to such cancelled Company Stock Option, without interest
(such amounts payable hereunder, the “Option Payments”); provided, however, that (x) any such Company Stock Option with
respect to which the exercise price per share subject thereto is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled in exchange for no consideration and (y) such Option Payments may be reduced by the amount of any required Tax
withholdings as provided in  Section 2.08(h). The Surviving Corporation shall cause each Option Payment to be paid, less any
required Tax withholdings, as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (and not later than the first regularly scheduled
payroll date on or after the fifth Business Day after the Effective Time) through its payroll systems. From and after the Effective
Time, no Company Stock Option shall be outstanding, and each Company Stock Option shall only entitle the holder thereof to the
payment provided for in this  Section 2.07(d)(i).

      (ii)   Treatment of Company RSUs.   Each restricted stock unit award granted pursuant to the Company Equity Plan,
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Company RSU”) shall, at the Effective
Time, automatically and without any required action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder thereof or any
other Person, become fully vested and be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive, following the Effective Time, a cash
payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest (such amounts
payable hereunder, the “Company RSU Payments”); provided, however, that such Company RSU Payments may be reduced by the
amount of any required Tax withholdings as provided in  Section 2.08(h). For purposes of clarification, if, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a Company RSU remains subject to a performance-based vesting condition, such Company RSU shall, at such time
and in accordance with the terms thereof, become earned at the target performance level, and such Company RSU shall, at the
Effective Time,

become fully vested and be cancelled in the same manner as described in the preceding sentence. The Surviving Corporation shall
cause each Company RSU Payment to be paid, less any required Tax withholdings, as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time (and not later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date on or after the fifth Business Day after the Effective
Time) through its payroll systems. From and after the Effective Time, no Company RSU shall be outstanding, and each Company
RSU shall only entitle the holder thereof to the payment provided for in this  Section 2.07(d)(ii).

      (iii)   Treatment of Company ESPP.   As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall take
any actions, and the Board of Directors of the Company and/or the Compensation Committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions, that are necessary to provide that with respect to the Company 2010 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan, as amended (the “Company ESPP”): (A) participants in the Company ESPP may not alter their payroll deductions from those
in effect on the date of this Agreement (other than to discontinue their participation in the Company ESPP) and no new participants
may begin participating in the current offering period, (B) no offering period will be commenced after the date of this Agreement (it
being understood that any offering period in effect on the date hereof may continue in accordance with its terms), (C) any offering
period that is in effect as of the date of this Agreement shall be terminated effective as of the last day of the purchase period that is
in effect as of the date of this Agreement or, if earlier, prior to the Effective Time, and all amounts then credited to the accounts of
participants shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, (D)
the amount of the accumulated contributions of each participant under the Company ESPP as of the termination of the Company
ESPP shall, to the extent not used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the Company ESPP, be
refunded to such participant as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (without interest and less any required Tax
withholdings), and (E) the Company ESPP shall be terminated as of the Effective Time. To the extent such accumulated
contributions are used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock, the purchased shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to  Section 2.07(c).

      (iv)   At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any actions, and the Board of Directors of the Company
and/or the Compensation Committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions, that are necessary to
(A) effectuate the treatment of the Company Stock Options and the Company RSUs (collectively, the “Company Equity Awards”)
and the Company ESPP as provided in this  Section 2.07(d) and (B) cause the Company Equity Plan and the Company ESPP to
terminate at or prior to the Effective Time, it being understood and agreed that from and after the Effective Time, no Company
Equity Award holder shall have any right with respect to any Company Equity Award or otherwise under any Company Equity Plan,
and no participant in the Company ESPP shall have any rights with respect to the Company ESPP, in each case other than to receive
the payment provided for in this Section 2.07(d).

(e)   Anti-Dilution.   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, business
combination, tender or exchange offer, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon
shall be declared with a record date within such period, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event; provided, however, that (i) in no event shall the aggregate amount payable by Parent pursuant to  Section 2.08 after
giving effect to any such event exceed the amount that would have been payable pursuant to  Section 2.08 had such event not
occurred and (ii) nothing in this  Section 2.07 shall permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 2.08.   Disposition of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares.

(a)   Paying Agent.   Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a U.S.-based nationally recognized bank or trust
company, which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the payment of the
Per Share Merger Consideration to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock as provided in  Section 2.07(c). Parent will
enter into a paying agent agreement with the Paying Agent (the “Paying Agent Agreement”) on terms reasonably acceptable to
Parent and the Company prior to the Closing. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in immediately
available funds in the amount necessary for payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with

 Section 2.07(c) and this  Section 2.08 (such total deposited cash being hereinafter referred to as the “Payment Fund”). The Paying
Agent shall make payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration out of the Payment Fund in accordance with this Agreement and
the Paying Agent Agreement. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. As soon as reasonably practicable but no
later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date on or after the fifth Business Day after the Effective Time, Parent shall pay or
cause to be paid to the Surviving Corporation in cash the amounts payable in respect of the Company Stock Options pursuant to
Section 2.07(d)(i) and the Company RSUs pursuant to Section 2.07(d)(ii), and the Surviving Corporation shall disburse such
amounts in accordance with Section 2.07(d)(i) and Section 2.07(d)(ii), respectively, to the extent the Surviving Corporation does not
have the cash on hand to pay such amounts.

(b)   Stock Transfer Books.   At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise
provided for herein. From and after the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Paying Agent,
Parent, or the Surviving Corporation for any reason (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Excluded Shares)
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(c)   Payment Procedures.

      (i)   As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares
and Dissenting Shares) (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass to the Paying Agent, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying
Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree) and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Per
Share Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be reasonably required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor an amount of cash in immediately available funds equal to (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) multiplied by (2) the Per Share Merger Consideration (less any
required Tax withholdings as provided in  Section 2.08(h)), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable pursuant to this  Section 2.08.

      (ii)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this  Article 2. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares
whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration shall upon receipt by the Paying Agent of
an “agent’s message” in customary form (or such other documentation or evidence, if any, as Parent or the Paying Agent may
reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of each such share of Company Common Stock
(less any required Tax withholdings as provided in  Section 2.08(h)), and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be
cancelled.

(d)   Termination of Payment Fund.   Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains unclaimed for nine (9) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

shares of Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time who have not theretofore complied with this  Article 2 shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat, or similar Laws).

(e)   No Liability.   None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company or, the Paying Agent, or any
employee, officer, director, agent, representative or, Affiliate thereof, shall be liable to any Person in respect of the Per Share Merger
Consideration from the Payment Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat, or similar Law.

(f)   Investment of Payment Fund.   The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund as directed by Parent (on behalf of the
Surviving Corporation); provided, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation,
respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers’ acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $25 billion, or in funds investing solely in such obligations that provide for same day liquidity. Any net profit resulting
from, or interest or income produced by, such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation or Parent (at Parent’s election).
To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Payment Fund diminishes for other reasons below the
level required to make prompt cash payments of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall
promptly replace or restore the portion of the Payment Fund required so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is, at all times,
maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments.

(g)   Lost Certificates.   If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, or destroyed, and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting
by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen, or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

(h)   Withholding Rights.   Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

(i)   Dissenters’ Rights.   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock, if
any, as to which the holder thereof shall have (i) properly demanded that the Company purchase such shares of Company Common
Stock for fair market value in accordance with, and otherwise complied with, the provisions of Chapter 13 of the CGCL (“Chapter
13”), and (ii) not effectively withdrawn or lost such holder’s rights to demand purchase for such shares of Company Common Stock
for fair market value pursuant to Chapter 13 (each, a “Dissenting Share”), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to  Section 2.07(c), but instead at the Effective Time shall become entitled only to
payment from the Surviving Corporation of the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock determined in accordance
with Chapter 13 (it being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled, and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto other than the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance with Chapter 13);
provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw, or lose the right to payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares under Chapter 13, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder’s
Dissenting Shares shall cease, and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and
to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest or duplication, the Per Share Merger Consideration.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company pursuant to Chapter 13, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the CGCL and received by the Company relating to
rights to be paid the fair market value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and control all
negotiations and Actions with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior

demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration paid to the Paying Agent
to pay for shares that have become Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand, but solely with respect to Dissenting
Shares that (A) the Surviving Corporation has become obligated to purchase for fair market value in accordance with the provisions
of Chapter 13 pursuant to an Order of a Governmental Authority or (B) the Surviving Company has agreed with the holders of such
Dissenting Shares to settle such demand to purchase such Dissenting Shares pursuant to an agreement between such parties.

contemplated thereby to be unavailable at the Closing. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the

Section 5.02.   Acquisition Proposals.

(a)   From the execution of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of (x) the date of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms and (y) the Effective Time, except as expressly permitted by Section 5.02(b), the Company shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and employees not to, and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries’ other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer or
request for information that would reasonably be expected to lead to or result in an Acquisition Proposal, or the making or
consummation thereof, (ii) other than to inform any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this  Section 5.02, enter
into, continue, or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information in
connection with, or enter into any Contract or other agreement or understanding with respect to, any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer or request for information that would reasonably be expected to lead to or result in an
Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing. From and after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and direct its and their respective Representatives to (A) immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer or request for information that would reasonably be expected to lead
to or result in an Acquisition Proposal, (B) terminate access by any other Person to any physical or electronic data room or other
access to data or information of the Company, in each case relating to or in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal or any
potential Acquisition Proposal, (C) request the prompt return or destruction of all information provided to any other Person prior to
the date of this Agreement in connection with any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer or request for information that
would reasonably be expected to lead to or result in an Acquisition Proposal and (D) enforce, and not waive or modify, the
provisions of any existing confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement entered into with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any
potential Acquisition Proposal, including any standstill provisions contained therein (provided that, in the case of clause (D), if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the Board of Director’s fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable
Law, the Company may waive any such standstill provision solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make, on a
confidential basis to the Board of Directors of the Company, an Acquisition Proposal, conditioned upon such third party agreeing
that the Company shall not be prohibited from providing any information to Parent (including regarding any such Acquisition
Proposal) in accordance with, and otherwise complying with, this  Section 5.02). It is agreed that (1) any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this Section 5.02(a) by any officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall constitute a
breach of this  Section 5.02 by the Company and (2) any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal, offer or request that results from
any violation of the foregoing restrictions by any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than such
Representatives included in the foregoing clause (1)) shall be deemed to be not in compliance with this  Section 5.02. The Company
hereby releases Parent from its obligation to comply with the standstill provisions contained in its Confidentiality Agreement from
and after the date hereof.

(b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, in response to a bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and did not result from a
breach of  or deemed non-compliance with Section 5.02(a)) that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, the Company shall give Parent written notice of such determination promptly after the Board of Directors of the
Company makes such determination (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after such determination) and, after the
delivery of such written notice, the Company and its Representatives may (i) furnish information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement containing terms no less favorable to the disclosing party than those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement
(excluding any standstill agreement contained therein) (an “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”); provided, that all such
information (to the extent that such information

concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to such Person and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

(c)   The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than twenty four (24) hours) after receipt by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of its or their Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry that would be reasonably
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or of any request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
for access to the business, properties, assets, books, or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Person that to the
knowledge of the Company may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall be provided
orally and in writing and shall provide the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication, or request
(including the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and copies of any related
documentation, including any related financing commitments). Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent promptly informed in
writing on a reasonably current basis of the status of, and any material changes to, the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal
(including providing Parent a notification in writing within twenty-four (24) hours following any determination by the Board of
Directors of the Company pursuant to Section 5.02(b) or any material changes to the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal) and
any discussions and negotiations concerning the material terms and conditions thereof.

(d)   Except as otherwise provided in  Section 5.02(e) and  Section 5.02(f), the Board of Directors of the Company (or any
committee thereof) shall not (i) (A) withdraw or publicly propose to withdraw, or modify or qualify (or public propose to modify or
qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (B) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (C) if a tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal shall have
been commenced by a person that is not affiliated with Parent or Merger Sub, fail to publish, send or give to its shareholders,
pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, within the ten Business day period after such tender offer or exchange offer is first
published, sent or given, or subsequently amended in any material respect or withdraw, a statement recommending that shareholders
reject such tender offer or exchange offer and affirm the Company Board Recommendation, or (D) approve, adopt or recommend
any Acquisition Proposal, or propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action in this clause
(i), a “Company Adverse Recommendation Change”) or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, adopt or
recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into any Contract or other agreement or
understanding (written or oral, binding or non-binding, preliminary or definitive), other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement to the extent expressly permitted by Section 5.02(b), with any Person constituting or relating to, or that is intended to or
would reasonably be expected to lead to or result in, any Acquisition Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the
Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the
Company to fail to comply with this Agreement (any such document, agreement or arrangement, an “Alternative Acquisition
Agreement”).

(e)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval an Intervening Event has occurred, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if and only if it concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board of Director’s fiduciary duties to the shareholders of
the Company under applicable Law; provided, that the Board of Directors of the Company shall not be entitled to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change (under clauses (A) or (B) of the definition thereof) pursuant to this  Section 5.02(e) unless (i) the
Company shall have provided Parent at least five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such
action, which notice shall (A) state that an Intervening Event has occurred, and (B) specify the material facts and circumstances
(based on information reasonably available) related to such Intervening Event, (ii) if requested by Parent, the Company and its
Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith during such five (5) Business Day period following delivery of such written

Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the Board of Director’s fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company
under applicable Law, after giving due consideration to any changes proposed to be made to this Agreement by Parent in writing.

(f)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval, a written bona fide Acquisition Proposal that is first made after the date hereof and did not result from a breach of this
 Section 5.02 is made, and the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to approve or
recommend such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the Board of Director’s fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the
Company under applicable Law, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
and/or the Company may terminate this Agreement in accordance with this  Section 5.02(f) and  Section 7.01(e), provided, however,
that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  Section 5.02(f) or  Section 7.01(e) unless the Company (i) has
complied with and not breached its obligations under this  Section 5.02, including its obligations set forth in  Section 5.02(g), (ii)

prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such action, which notice shall (A) state that the Company has received a
Superior Proposal, (B) specify the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, including the identity of the Person
making such Superior Proposal, and (C) enclose the most recent draft of any agreements intended to be entered into with the Person
making or providing such Superior Proposal (or any Affiliate of such Person), (ii) if requested by Parent, the Company and its
Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith during such five (5) Business Day period following delivery of such written

Proposal and (iii) after complying with clauses (i) and (ii) of this  Section 5.02(g), the Board of Directors shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal, after giving due consideration to any changes proposed to be made to this Agreement by Parent in a
writing. The parties acknowledge and agree that, (A) if Parent, within five (5) Business Days following its receipt of the written
notice referred to in this  Section 5.02(g), makes a proposal that, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Company (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor), results in the applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer
being a Superior Proposal, then the Board of Directors shall have no right to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to  Section 5.02(f) and the Company shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  Section 5.02(f) or  Section
7.01(e) as a result of such Acquisition Proposal, and (B) any (x) revisions to the financial terms or any other material terms of a
Superior Proposal or (y) revisions to the financial terms or any other material terms to an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company had determined no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal, shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal and
shall in each case require the Company to deliver to Parent a new written notice pursuant to this  Section 5.02(g) and a new five (5)
Business Day period shall commence thereafter; provided, however, that such new five (5) Business Day notice period shall be
shortened to three (3) Business Days if the only change to the material terms of such Superior Proposal is an increase in (without
any change to the form of) the per share merger consideration. The Board of Directors of the Company shall have no right to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to  Section 5.02(f) and the Company shall have no right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  Section 5.02(f) or  Section 7.01(e) unless it has complied with the procedures set forth in  Section 5.02(f) and

except in compliance with this  Section 5.02.

(i)   For purposes of this Agreement:

      (i)   “Acquisition Proposal” means any proposal or offer with respect to (A) a merger, consolidation or other business
combination, tender offer, exchange offer, or any transaction involving the purchase or acquisition of 20% or more of the shares of

purchase or acquisition of 20% or more of the assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (other than
any such proposal or offer made by Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their Affiliates).

      (ii)   “Superior Proposal” means any bona fide Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company
concludes in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into account all financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, (A) is on terms
more favorable to the Company’s shareholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(after giving effect to all the proposed changes by Parent in accordance with  Section 5.02(g)), (B) is reasonably likely to be
completed on a timely basis and does not contain any conditionality that is related to completion of due diligence or having obtained
financing for the Superior Proposal, and (C) the financing of which is fully committed (provided that for the purpose of this

Agreement, the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC in preliminary form the Proxy Statement. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or
the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information, and shall promptly
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or
the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall (with the assistance of Parent) (i) respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, including filing any
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement as may be required, and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy
Statement cleared by the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after such filing, and (iii) cause the Proxy Statement to be filed in
definitive form and mailed to the Company’s shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter. Prior to filing or mailing
the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC
with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such
document or response (and the Company shall give good faith consideration to including any such reasonable comments in the
Proxy Statement (or any supplement or amendment thereto) or response letter).

(b)   Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Merger Sub as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise assist and
cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and resolution of comments of the SEC or its staff related
thereto. Parent will cause the information relating to Parent or Merger Sub supplied by it in writing expressly for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement, at the time of the filing or mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the
time of the Shareholders Meeting, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

Shareholders Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record date for the Shareholders
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent. If the record date for the Shareholders Meeting is changed, the Company shall,
as to that record date, comply with each of its obligations under this  Section 5.03. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, officers or directors should be
discovered by the Company or Parent which, pursuant to the Securities Act or Exchange Act, is required to be set forth in an
amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly inform the other Party and the Company
shall promptly file an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information with the SEC and, to the extent required
by applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the shareholders of the Company. Each of Parent and the
Company agree (and Parent agrees to cause Merger Sub) to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy
Statement which shall have become false or misleading. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause all documents that such Party
is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and, as applicable, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

(d)   Unless there has occurred a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with  Section 5.02(e), the Board of
Directors of the Company shall make the Company Board Recommendation with respect to the approval of this Agreement, and the
Company shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit
proxies in favor of the Company Shareholder Approval. Parent and Merger Sub shall vote all shares of Company Common Stock
held by them in favor of the approval of this Agreement.

Section 5.04.   Access to Information; Notice of Certain Events; Confidentiality.   From the date hereof until the earlier of
(x) the Effective Time and (y) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms:

(a)   The Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries, employees and other Representatives to) provide (i) Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access at reasonable times, and upon reasonable notice to the Company, consistent with applicable Law,
to the books and records and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) any financial, operating and other data and
information regarding the assets, properties, or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may from time to time
reasonably request; provided, that (A) such access or information requests do not unreasonably interfere with the operation of the
Company’s and its Subsidiaries’ business and such access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be subject to
their respective reasonable security measures and insurance requirements, (B) Parent and its Representatives shall not contact or
otherwise communicate with the customers or suppliers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than contact or other
communications with such customers or suppliers by Parent or its Representatives in the ordinary course of business and not related
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, unless, in each instance, approved in writing in advance by the Company, (C)
such access shall not require the Company or its Subsidiaries to allow any environmental testing or sampling, and (D) for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall require the Company or its Subsidiaries to furnish to Parent or its Representatives, or
provide Parent or its Representatives with access to, information that legal counsel for the Company reasonably determines would
(1) be subject to an attorney-client or other legal privilege or (2) violate any applicable Law; provided that the Company shall give
notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or documents pursuant to clause (1) or clause (2) above, and
thereafter the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not
reasonably be expected to waive the applicable privilege or protection or violate the Applicable Law.

(b)   The Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of (i) any notice or other communication
received by such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of such Party, any of their

be required in connection with the Merger; (ii) any notice or other communication received by such Party or any of its Subsidiaries,

hereby; and (iii) any fact, event or circumstance known to it that would be reasonably likely to result in the failure of any of the
conditions set forth in  Article 6 to be capable of being satisfied prior to the End Date; provided, that the failure to deliver any notice
pursuant to this  Section 5.04(b)(iii) shall not be considered in determining whether the conditions set forth in  Article 6 have been
satisfied.

(c)   Parent acknowledges that the information, notification and access provided pursuant to this  Section 5.04 shall be subject to
the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated November 28, 2016, by and between the
Company and Parent (as supplemented or amended, the “Confidentiality Agreement”), which Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and shall survive any termination of this Agreement. No investigation
pursuant to this  Section 5.04 or information or notification provided or received by Parent pursuant to this Agreement will affect any
of the representations or warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement (or the Disclosure Letter) or prejudice the rights and
remedies of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder.

Section 5.05.   Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a)   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each Party shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, use their reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable but subject to the limitations set forth in  Section 5.05(e), (i)
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Authority
any consent, approval, authorization, waiver, or order required to be obtained or made by any Party or any of their respective
Affiliates and avoid any Action by any Governmental Authority, in each case in connection with the Merger and to fulfill the
conditions to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions, with respect to this Agreement required under applicable Law, including the HSR Act and any other
applicable Antitrust Laws, in each case in connection with the Merger and to fulfill the conditions to the transactions contemplated

their respective Affiliates to, cooperate with each other in connection with obtaining all such consents, approvals, authorizations,
waivers, or orders and the making of all such filings, including, unless prohibited by applicable Law or a Governmental Authority,
providing copies of all relevant documents to outside counsel for the non-filing Party prior to filing and, if reasonably requested,
considering in good faith all reasonable additions, deletions, or changes suggested in connection therewith. Subject to  Section 5.04
above and the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
promptly furnish to each other all information reasonably required for any application or other filing to be made by the other with
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b)   Parent and the Company agree to make (i) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR
Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event within twelve (12) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement, and (ii) appropriate filings, if any are required, pursuant to foreign Antitrust Laws as
promptly as practicable. Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, comply at the earliest
practicable date with any request under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws to provide information, documents, or other
materials requested by any Governmental Authority.

(c)   Parent and the Company shall each request early termination of the waiting period provided for in the HSR Act. Parent

forth in  Section 5.05(e). In connection with any investigation or other inquiry, Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, unless prohibited by applicable Law or a Governmental Authority, (i) keep the other Party promptly
informed of any communication received by such Party or any of its Affiliates from any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) provide outside counsel for the other Party with a reasonable opportunity to (A)

any Governmental Authority, (B) consult with the other Party prior to any meeting or conference with any Governmental Authority,
and (C) attend and participate in such meetings or conferences. Without the prior written consent of the other Party, Parent and the
Company will not, and will not permit their respective Affiliates to consent or agree to extend the waiting period under the HSR Act
or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d)   Each of Parent and the Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other under this  Section 5.05 as “outside counsel only.” Such competitively sensitive material and
the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from an
authorized officer of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or its legal counsel.

(e)   In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties contained in this  Section 5.05, Parent and the Company
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do,
or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper, or advisable to resolve such objections, if any, as any Governmental
Authority may assert under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and avoid the institution of any Action under any such Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case so as
to enable the Merger to occur before the End Date, including by (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to, and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, or disposition of any assets or businesses of Parent or its Affiliates or
the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating existing, or creating new, relationships, contractual rights, or obligations of Parent
or its Affiliates or the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (iii) effectuating any other change or restructuring of Parent or its Affiliates or
the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that limit the freedom of action of Parent or
its Affiliates or the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to, or ability to retain, one or more assets or businesses, to ensure that
no Governmental Authority enters any Order or establishes any Law preliminarily or permanently restraining, enjoining, or
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to ensure that no Governmental Authority
with the authority to authorize or approve such consummation fails to do so before the End Date; provided, however, that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no such action under the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii)
shall be (A) required to be proposed, agreed to or taken by Parent or its Affiliates except to the extent necessary to permit the
consummation of the Merger to occur before the End Date, (B) required unless contingent upon the occurrence of the Merger, (C)
proposed, agreed to, or taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Parent, or (D) required to be
proposed, agreed to or taken by Parent or its Affiliates if such action would have a material adverse effect on the business, results of
operations, or financial condition of (x) the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) or (y) Parent and its Subsidiaries (taken
as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger).

(f)   Each of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to, cooperate with the other Party
and use its reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any Action, including any administrative or judicial Action, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any Order (whether temporary, preliminary, or permanent) that is threatened or in effect and
that restricts, prevents, or prohibits consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any
other Antitrust Laws, including by pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal; provided, however, that such
obligation to contest and resist any Action in no way limits the obligation of the Company or Parent to, and to cause its Affiliates to,
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary,
proper, or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable
and in any event before the End Date in accordance with, and subject to the limitations set forth in,  Section 5.05(e).

satisfy the conditions to the Merger set forth in  Section 6.01(b),  Section 6.01(c) (to the extent related to the HSR Act or the Antitrust
Laws set forth in Section 6.01(d) of the Disclosure Letter) or  Section 6.01(d).

Section 5.06.   Indemnification, Exculpation, and Insurance.

(a)   For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (i) to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, to include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving Corporation’s (or any successor’s) organizational
documents provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, and indemnification of and advancement of expenses to
directors and officers of the Company, no less favorable than those contained in the Company’s Organizational Documents as of the
date hereof, in favor of all past and present directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries (individually, an “Indemnified
Party” and, collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”) in connection with acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) to honor the Company’s obligations under the Company’s Organizational Documents and those certain Indemnification
Agreements by and between the Company and those individuals listed in Section 5.06 of the Disclosure Letter (collectively, the
“Indemnification Agreements”) to the fullest extent permitted by Law, but in no event to any lesser extent than the Company would
be required to perform them if the transactions contemplated hereby had not taken place.

(b)   In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties, rights, and other assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper provision to be made so that such successor or assign shall
assume the obligations set forth in this  Section 5.06.

(c)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay for, at no expense to the beneficiaries, non-cancellable “tail” insurance
policies with a claims period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, “D&O Insurance”), for the persons who are covered by the
Company’s existing D&O Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions, and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured
individuals as the Company’s existing D&O Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby); provided that the amount paid for such tail
policy shall not exceed 250% of the amount the Company paid for the D&O Insurance in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of
this Agreement (the “Current Premium”) without the prior written consent of Parent. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation
for any reason fail to obtain such “tail” insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, at no expense to the beneficiaries, D&O Insurance for a period of
at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time for the persons who are covered by the Company’s existing D&O Insurance,
with terms, conditions, retentions, and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided in such existing D&O Insurance; provided
that in satisfying its obligation under this  Section 5.06(c), the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay aggregate
premiums in excess of 250% of the Current Premium and, if such aggregate premiums for such insurance would exceed 250% of the
Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving
Corporation’s good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available for an aggregate premium equal to 250%% of the
Current Premium. Parent hereby acknowledges that under the Indemnification Agreements, the Company has certain obligations
relating to the D&O Insurance coverage to be obtained pursuant to this Agreement, including this  Section 5.06(c). Parent further
acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any
Indemnification Agreement, the terms of the Indemnification Agreement will prevail.

(d)   Parent hereby guarantees the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under Section 5.06(a)(ii), which guarantee shall (i)
be solely a guarantee of payment by the Surviving Corporation, (ii) be subject to all of the limitations under applicable Law and the
Company’s Organizational Documents that apply to such obligations of the Surviving Corporation and (iii) not expand the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation to any of the Indemnified Parties in any way.

(e)   The provisions of this  Section 5.06 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable from and after the
Effective Time by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs, and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract or otherwise.

Section 5.07.   Employee Matters.

(a)   For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
remains in the active employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the “Continuing Employees”) shall receive (i)
an annual rate of salary or wages and annual incentive opportunities that are, in each case, no less favorable than that provided to
such employee as of the date of this Agreement, and (ii) employee benefits, that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to the
employee benefits provided to such employee as of the date of this Agreement. In addition, the flexible spending accounts
maintained under the Company’s cafeteria plan will continue to be maintained through a date ending no earlier than the last day of
the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, unless such accounts are merged prior thereto into successor arrangements
maintained by the Surviving Corporation.

(b)   Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company shall take no action after the date of this
Agreement that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific Benefit Plans or
compensation, retention or employment arrangements, or to continue the employment of any specific person. In no event shall the
terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Benefit Plan or any “employee benefit plan” as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, Surviving
Corporation, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan or any other compensation or
benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date.

(c)   Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to recognize the service of each Continuing Employee with the Company or
its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or its Subsidiaries to the extent service with such
predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries) as if such service had been performed with Parent with
respect to any vacation or severance plans, policies or programs in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the
Effective Time for all purposes under such vacation or severance plans, policies or programs, except, in each case, to the extent such
treatment would result in duplicative benefits.

(d)   With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after the
Effective Time, Parent shall take commercially reasonable efforts to, or to cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions and limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements, waiting periods, and any other
restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving
Corporation with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such conditions and
exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees under the welfare plans or comparable welfare plans maintained by the
Company prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to the Effective Time in the same plan year in which the Effective Time occurs in satisfying any analogous deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements to the extent applicable under the relevant welfare benefit plan in which Continuing Employees
participate from and after the Effective Time, as if there had been a single continuous employer, to the extent credited under the
welfare plans maintained by the Company prior to the Effective Time. Such credited expenses, if any, shall count toward any annual
or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply under the terms of the applicable plan.

(e)   From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all
obligations under the Benefit Plans and compensation, retention and employment arrangements, and agreements identified in
Section 5.07(e) of the Disclosure Letter in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective Time.

(f)   The Company shall provide Parent with the right to review any material written communications related to the transactions
contemplated hereby that are intended for broad-based and general distribution to any current or former employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

(g)   If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date,
the Board of Directors of the Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate action
as is necessary to terminate the Company’s 401(k) plan (the “Company 401(k) Plan”), effective as of the day prior to the Closing
Date. Following the Effective Time and as soon as practicable following receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS on
the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants, and Parent shall, to the extent
permitted by Parent’s applicable 401(k) plan (the “Parent 401(k) Plan”), permit the Continuing Employees who are then actively
employed to make rollover contributions of “eligible rollover distributions” (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code,
but not inclusive of loans), in the form of cash, in an amount equal to the full account balance (excluding loans) distributed to such
employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

(h)   No later than fifteen (15) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list
of each “disqualified individual” (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (i) the
Company’s reasonable, good faith estimate of the maximum amount (separately identifying single and double-trigger amounts and
tax gross-up payments, if any) that could be paid to, or benefits received by, such disqualified individual as a result of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or a termination of employment or service (with respect to either of the foregoing,
alone or in combination with any other event, including as the result of the accelerated vesting of Company Equity Awards or the
making of the Option Payments or the Company RSU Payments), (ii) the “base amount” (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the
Code) for each such disqualified individual, (iii) the amount of “excess parachute payments” (as defined in Section 280G of the
Code) and (iv) underlying documentation on which such calculations are based.

(i)   The provisions of this  Section 5.07 are for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former
employees, directors, or independent contractors of any of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
or on or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), other than the Parties, any legal or equitable
or other rights or remedies with respect to the matters provided for in this  Section 5.07.

Section 5.08.   Public Announcements.   Except with respect to (i) any public statement by the Company containing (A) a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (B) a statement of the reasons of the Board of Directors of the Company for
making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, made in accordance with, and after compliance with,  Section 5.02 (in
which case, this  Section 5.08 shall apply only to such public statement with respect to any information relating to Parent or its
business, financial condition or results of operations set forth in such public statement) and (ii) any public statement by Parent
issued in connection with the issuance of a public statement of the type referred to in clause (i), Parent and the Company shall
consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such Party may reasonably conclude may
be required by applicable Law, court process or any listing agreement with, or rules of, any national securities exchange or national
securities quotation system on which the securities of such Party are listed. The Parties agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the Parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may make public statements with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including their effect on Parent’s business and its financial projections, with investors, analysts and Financing
Sources, including, without limitation, on its periodic earnings calls and in any “road show”, so long as Parent’s comments are not
inconsistent with the press releases previously issued and agreed upon by the Parties.

Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions

Disclosure Letter in connection with the Merger; provided, that the Company shall not be required to pay any material cash
consideration to any such third parties in connection with the obtaining of the required consents or waivers pursuant to this  Section
5.10. Without limiting the express obligations in the preceding sentence, Parent acknowledges and agrees (and Merger Sub will
acknowledge and agree) that having actually obtained any such consents or waivers is not a condition to Closing.

all other reasonable actions to cause (a) the repayment in full on the Closing Date (or in the case of letters of credit, cash
collateralization, to the extent that Parent shall not have entered into an alternative arrangement with the issuing bank) of all
obligations then outstanding under, (b) the release on the Closing Date in connection with such repayment of all Liens securing such
obligations under, and (c) the termination (to the extent provided therein and pursuant to the terms thereof) on the Closing Date of,

promptly informing Parent of the contents of such communication or (b) allowing Parent’s counsel to participate in such
communication. The Company shall not settle any Shareholder Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

Section 5.15.   Financing.

(a)   Parent shall not agree to any amendment or modification to, or grant any waiver of, any provision under the Commitment
Letter without the prior written consent of the Company if such amendment, modification or waiver would (i) impose additional
conditions to the receipt of the Financing on the Closing Date, or otherwise amend or modify any such conditions in a manner that is
adverse in any material respect to Parent or the Company, (ii) individually or in the aggregate with all other amendments,
modifications or waivers to the Commitment Letter, reasonably be expected to prevent or make less likely to occur the funding of
the commitments thereunder on the Closing Date or (iii) reduce the aggregate amount of the available commitments thereunder
other than to the extent the representations set forth in Section 4.07(c) would continue to be true after giving effect thereto (the
foregoing clauses (i) through (iii), the “Prohibited Changes”); provided that, without the consent of the Company, Parent may
amend (it being understood that no such amendment shall constitute a Prohibited Change) the Commitment Letter to add additional
lenders, arrangers, bookrunners and agents or to implement or exercise any of the “market flex” provisions contained in any Fee
Letter. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall be entitled to replace the
Commitment Letter by entering into definitive documentation with respect to the Financing on or prior to the Closing so long as
such definitive documentation is on terms and conditions consistent with the Commitment Letter and would not result in Prohibited
Changes.

(b)   Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Financing on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in the Commitment Letter, including, prior to the consummation of the Financing in an aggregate amount that is sufficient (taken
together with any cash available to Parent) for the representation set forth in Section 4.07(c) to continue to be true, using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter (including any definitive documentation entered into in
connection therewith), (ii) satisfy all conditions in the Commitment Letter (including any definitive documentation entered into in
connection therewith) applicable to Parent and Merger Sub to obtaining the Financing thereunder as promptly as practicable (taking
into account the expected timing of the Effective Time) (other than any condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct result
of the Company’s failure to furnish information to Parent or otherwise comply with its obligations or the accuracy of any of its
representations under this Agreement), (iii) as promptly as practicable (taking into account the expected timing of the Effective
Time), negotiate, execute, and deliver definitive documentation with respect to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter on the terms and subject to the conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter (or on terms not less favorable to Parent
and Merger Sub than the terms and conditions (including market flex provisions) set forth in the Commitment Letter and related Fee
Letter), and (v) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter and Sections 6.01 and 6.02, cause the
Financing Sources party thereto to fund the Financing thereunder on or prior to the Closing Date. If any portion of the Financing
otherwise becomes unavailable, and such portion is reasonably required to fund the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration and
all fees and expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent
and Merger Sub will use their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain in replacement thereof alternative financing from
alternative sources in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration and such fees and expenses payable
by Parent and Merger Sub. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.15 to the contrary, solely to the extent the representations set
forth in Section 4.07(c) shall continue to be true, Parent will have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated equity
securities issuances or equity linked, convertible, exchangeable or other debt securities issuances or other incurrences of debt for all
or any portion of the amount contemplated to be provided by the Bridge Financing contemplated by the Bridge Commitment Letter
and may reduce the amount of the commitments thereunder. Any reference in this Agreement to the “Financing” will include the
Bridge Financing and any such alternative, replacement or substitute financing, any reference in this Agreement to the
“Commitment Letter” will include the Bridge Commitment Letter and the commitment letter, if any, and the corresponding fee letter
with respect to any such alternative financing or such replacement financing.

(c)   Upon the Company’s reasonable request, Parent will keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis
of the status of Parent’s and Merger Sub's efforts to arrange the Financing and to satisfy the conditions thereof, including, upon the
Company’s reasonable request, advising and updating the Company, in

which Parent becomes aware or (ii) if for any reason Parent determines in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any

accordance with the terms thereof).

(d)   In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including the Financing) by or to Parent or any of its
Affiliates or any other financing transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, it being
understood that nothing in this Section 5.15(d) is intended to limit (i) the provision of the Required Information pursuant to Section
2.02 or (ii) any condition contained in Section 6.01 or 6.02.

expense, customary cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub that is necessary in connection with the
arrangement and consummation of the Parent Financing, including (in each case, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent):

      (i)   participating in a reasonable number of meetings, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions between senior
management and the actual or perspective Financing Sources;

memoranda, offering memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents customary in order to consummate the Parent Financing or

accounting firm of the Company (including negative assurance comfort), and (B) cooperating with Parent in preparing such pro
forma financial statements and other pro forma financial data and financial information;

      (iii)   providing reasonable and customary assistance with the preparation of documents customarily required in connection
with any bank debt, public or private senior note financings or equity securities issuances or equity linked, convertible,
exchangeable or other debt securities issuances and, to the extent required under the Commitment Letter (including any alternative
or replacement financing referred to in  Section 5.15(b)) or any other financing in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, providing all documentation and other information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries required
thereunder, including the customary representation letter to the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company in
connection with the delivery of a comfort letter or any consent, customary consents to use the audit reports relating to the Company,

      (iv)   using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in obtaining legal opinions from applicable outside counsel (and not

securities issuances or equity linked, convertible, exchangeable or other debt securities issuances, as the case may be (including, in
all cases, the Parent Financing); and

(b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Section 5.16, no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

firm of the Company in connection with the delivery of a comfort letter or consent, any customary authorization letters in
connection with any bank debt and any notices of prepayment and/or commitment terminations which are delivered by the
Company not in contravention of the applicable agreement and conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and delivered in

harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with
any Parent Financing and any information used in connection therewith, except and solely to the extent that any such obligations,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, awards, judgments and penalties, fees, costs or other liabilities are suffered or incurred as a
result of the Company’s or its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives’ gross negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct or material
breach of this Agreement.

(c)   Notwithstanding the requirements of this Section 5.16, (i) none of the Company or any of the Company’s Subsidiaries will
be required to pay or commit to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other liability (including any guarantee, indemnity or
pledge) for the Financing prior to the Effective Time, except fees that are promptly reimbursed by Parent and (ii) nothing in this
Section 5.16 will require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to provide any information or take any action, the disclosure or

(which need not be the same Acquisition Proposal described in clause (i) above), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Parent the Company Termination Fee prior to or concurrently with the consummation of such transaction by wire transfer of
immediately available U.S. dollars to the applicable account or accounts designated in writing to the Company by Parent. For
purposes of only subclause (ii) of this  Section 7.03(c), the term “Acquisition Proposal” shall have the meaning assigned to such term
in  Section 5.02(i)(i), except that the references to “20%” shall be deemed to be references to “50%”.

(d)   In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  Section 7.01(g), then Parent shall pay, or cause
to be paid, to the Company an amount equal to $500,000,000 (the “Parent Termination Fee”) on or before the third Business Day
following the date of such termination by wire transfer of immediately available U.S. dollars to the applicable account or accounts
designated in writing to Parent by the Company.

(e)   Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this  Section 7.03 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither the Company nor Parent or Merger Sub
would enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the Company Termination Fee in accordance
with  Section 7.03(b) or  Section 7.03(c) or Parent fails to promptly pay the Parent Termination Fee in accordance with  Section
7.03(d) (as applicable, the “Non-Paying Party”), and, in order to obtain such payment, the other Party (the “Recipient Party”)
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the Company Termination Fee or Parent for the Parent
Termination Fee (or any portion thereof), as the case may be, then the Non-Paying Party shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Recipient
Party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as the case may be, from and including the date payment of such
amount was due through the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made plus two percent (2%). Each of the Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee is non-refundable and shall
not be set off by or credited against any other payment.

(f)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, Parent’s right, if any, to receive the Company Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to  Section 7.03(b) or  Section
7.03(c), and the Company’s right, if any, to receive the Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to  Section 7.03(d), and the
amounts described in  Section 7.03(e), shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case
may be, and their respective Affiliates against the Parties and their respective former, current or future shareholders, directors,
officers, Affiliates, agents, or other Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the failure of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated, and upon payment of the Company Termination Fee by the Company or the Parent Termination Fee by Parent, as the
case may be, and any applicable amount described in  Section 7.03(e), none of the Parties or any of their respective former, current,
or future shareholders, directors, officers, Affiliates, agents, or other Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that
nothing in this  Section 7.03(f) shall (i) relieve any Party from any liabilities or damages resulting from any fraud or Willful Breach
committed by such Party prior to such termination (except in the case of a termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant
to  Section 7.01(g) entitling the Company to receive the Parent Termination Fee), or (ii) modify the agreements set forth in Sections
8.13. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee more than once or shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee more than once.

Section 7.04.   Amendment.   This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval; provided, however, that (a) any such amendment shall be in a writing
specifically designated as an amendment hereto and signed on behalf of each of the Parties, (b) after the Company Shareholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by applicable Law requires further approval by the
shareholders of the Company without such further approval, and (c) no amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the
Effective Time; provided, further, that this  Section 7.04,  Section 7.03(f),  Section 7.05,  Section 8.05,  Section 8.06,  Section 8.07,

the prior written consent of such Financing Source (and any such waiver without such consent shall be null and void). No failure to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege hereunder preclude the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. No
waiver of any breach of any provision shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same or any
other provision, nor shall any waiver be implied from any course of dealing between the Parties. No waiver of any provision of this
Agreement shall be effective except by written instrument executed by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No

constituting, representations or warranties of the Company except and solely to the extent that a representation or warranty set forth
in  Article 3 of this Agreement specifically states that a correct and complete list of a particular item is set forth on a particular
section of the Disclosure Letter. The fact that any item or other information is disclosed in the Disclosure Letter shall not be
construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Inclusion of any item or other matter in the

item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or that such item will in fact exceed any applicable

 Section 8.06, the Financing Sources and other Persons referred to therein. Except as expressly provided herein, the rights and
obligations of this Agreement may not be assigned by any Party without the prior written consent of the other Parties; provided that
Parent or Merger Sub, upon prior written notice to the Company, may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement (a) to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such
assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder or (b) to Financing Sources for collateral security
purposes in connection with the Financing.

Section 8.06.   No Third Party Beneficiaries.   Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended to confer any legal
or equitable rights, benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns; provided, however, that the Parties specifically acknowledge and agree that after the Effective
Time, (a)  Section 5.06 shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and (b) each holder of Company Common
Stock shall be entitled to enforce the provisions of Article 2 to the extent necessary to receive the consideration to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Article 2. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,  Section 7.03(f),  Section 7.04,  Section
7.05,  Section 8.05, this  Section 8.06,  Section 8.07,  Section 8.08,  Section 8.09 and Section 8.13 are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Financing Sources.

Section 8.07.   Governing Law.   This Agreement and its enforcement will be governed by, and interpreted in accordance
with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such state (provided that
the Merger and the exercise of the dissenters’ rights with respect to the Merger shall be governed by the Laws of the State of
California) without regard to the conflicts of law provisions thereof that would apply the laws of any other jurisdiction; provided
that, except as specifically set forth in the Commitment Letter, any Action, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger and the Financing, or any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Merger, the
Commitment Letter, the Financing, the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby shall be governed by, and
constructed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York.

Section 8.08.   Consent to Jurisdiction.   Each Party hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal court in the
Central District of California and any appellate courts therefrom, or if that court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, in the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (the “Chosen Courts”), for any
dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination or validity thereof. Each Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such proceedings brought in such court. Each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to
plead or argue in any such court (a) that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for any reason other than
the failure to serve process in accordance with applicable Law, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of
the Chosen Courts or from any legal process commenced in the Chosen Courts (including but not limited to service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law that (i) the suit, action, or proceeding in the Chosen Courts is brought in an inconvenient forum,
(ii) the venue of such suit, action, or proceeding is improper, and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by the Chosen Courts. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of the Parties agrees that it
will not bring or support any Action, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and
the Financing, or any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Merger, the Commitment Letter, the Financing or the
performance thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the United States federal court located in, or
if that court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, in any New York state court located in, the Borough of Manhattan within the
City of New York.

Section 8.09.   WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.   EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND

INCLUDING THE MERGER AND THE FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM
OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIM OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER IN LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCE).

Section 8.10.   Specific Performance.   The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur if any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, without posting bond or other undertaking, the Parties shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of
competent jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In the event that any
such action is brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no Party will allege, and each Party hereby waives the
defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law. The Parties further agree that (a) subject to the proviso in the last
sentence to this Section 8.10, by seeking any remedy provided for in this Section 8.10, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right
to seek any other form of relief that may be available to such Party under this Agreement and (b) nothing contained in this Section
8.10 shall require any Party to institute any action for (or limit such Party’s right to institute any action for) specific performance
under this Section 8.10 before exercising any other right under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company shall not be entitled to obtain specific performance of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to
consummate the Merger unless each of the following conditions are satisfied (a) all of the conditions set forth in  Section 6.01 and
 Section 6.02 shall have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
Closing itself, but subject to satisfaction thereof if the Closing were to occur at that time), (b) the Financing has been funded or will
be funded at the Closing, (c) Parent has failed to close within three (3) Business Days after the later of (i) the date the Closing
should occur in accordance with Section 2.02 and (ii) receipt of the written confirmation described in the following clause (d), and
(d) the Company has confirmed to Parent in writing that if specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded, and Parent
otherwise complies with its obligations hereunder, then the Closing will occur; provided that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance of Parent’s obligation to consummate the Merger and a payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

Section 8.11.   Severability.   If any provisions of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or circumstance, is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then (a) a substitute and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable in such jurisdiction, the intent and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable
provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not
be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability of such provision affect the validity
or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

Section 8.12.   Counterparts.   This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts (including by means of
facsimile and electronically transmitted portable document format (pdf) signature pages), each of which shall be an original but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Section 8.13.   Liability of Financing Sources.   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company acknowledges
and agrees that none of the Financing Sources shall have any liability to the Company or its Affiliates relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Financing, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims
against any Financing Sources under this Agreement and any other agreement contemplated by, or entered into in connection with,
the Financing, including any commitments by the Financing Sources in respect of the Financing. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in no event shall the Company or its Affiliates be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this
Agreement against any of the Financing Sources.

WHEREAS, Parent and the Company have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as it

material change in the capitalization of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the corporate structure of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, (H) to the extent submitted to a shareholder vote, against any change in the business management or Board of
Directors of the Company (other than as directed by Parent) and (I) against any action, proposal, transaction or agreement that is
intended to or would (1) result in an inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, or a breach of any covenant, or any other
obligation or agreement, of the Company contained in the Merger Agreement, or of a Shareholder contained in this Agreement, or
(2) prevent, materially impede, materially delay or otherwise materially and adversely affect the Company’s, Parent’s or Merger
Sub’s ability to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger (clauses (A)
through (I), the “Required Votes”). Except as explicitly set forth in this Section 1.1, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of
each Shareholder to vote (including by proxy or written consent, if applicable) in favor of, against or abstain with respect to any
other matters presented to the Company’s shareholders.

Section 1.2   Grant of Irrevocable Proxy; Appointment of Proxy.

(a)   From and after the date hereof until the Expiration Date, each Shareholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally grants
to, and appoints, Parent and any designee thereof as such Shareholder’s proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution)
in accordance with Section 705(e) of the California General Corporation Law, for and in the name, place and stead of such
Shareholder, to vote or cause to be voted (including by proxy or written consent, if applicable) the Shares owned by such
Shareholder as of the applicable record date in accordance with the Required Votes; provided that each Shareholder’s grant of the
proxy contemplated by this Section 1.2 shall be effective if, and only if, such Shareholder has not delivered to the Company prior to
the meeting at which any of the matters described in Section 1.1 are to be considered, a duly executed irrevocable proxy card
directing that the Shares of such Shareholder be voted in accordance with the Required Votes; provided, further, that any grant of
such proxy shall only entitle Parent or its designee to vote on the matters specified by Section 1.1(ii), and each Shareholder shall
retain the authority to vote on all other matters.

(b)   Each Shareholder hereby represents that any proxies heretofore given in respect of the Shares, if any, are revocable, and
hereby revokes all such proxies.

(c)   Each Shareholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this Section 1.2, if it becomes effective, is given in
connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the
duties of such Shareholder under this Agreement. The parties hereby further affirm that the irrevocable proxy, if it becomes
effective, is coupled with an interest and is intended to be irrevocable until the Expiration Date, at which time it will terminate
automatically, and any underlying appointment shall automatically be revoked and rescinded and of no force and effect, in each case
without further action by any party. The proxy granted by the Shareholders herein shall survive the dissolution, bankruptcy, death or
incapacity of any Shareholder. If for any reason any proxy granted herein is not irrevocable after it becomes effective, then the
Shareholder granting such proxy agrees, until the Expiration Date, to vote, or to cause the holder of record on any applicable record
date to vote, the Shares in accordance with the Required Votes. The parties agree that the foregoing is a voting agreement.

Section 1.3   Restrictions on Transfers.

(a)   Absent the prior written consent of Parent (which consent may be granted or withheld in Parent’s sole discretion), each
Shareholder hereby agrees that, from the date hereof until the Expiration Date, it shall not, directly or indirectly, (i) sell, transfer,
assign, tender in any tender or exchange offer, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or similarly dispose of (by merger, by testamentary
disposition, by operation of applicable Law or otherwise) (a “Transfer”), either voluntarily or involuntarily, or enter into any
contract, option or other arrangement or understanding providing for the Transfer of any Shares (or any Rights attached thereto, or
any economic interests therein), (ii) deposit any Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement or grant
any proxy or power of attorney with respect thereto, or (iii) agree (whether or not in writing) to take any of the actions prohibited by
the foregoing clause (i) or (ii). Any purported Transfer of Shares inconsistent with this Section 1.3 shall be null and void.

(b)   The restrictions set forth in Section 1.3(a) shall not apply to: (i) in the case of any Shareholder that is a natural person, any
Transfer of Shares by will or the laws of intestacy, or (ii) the Transfer of some or all Shares to any trust, partnership, corporation or
limited liability company established and held for the direct or indirect benefit of the Shareholder or his family members; provided
that, in each case, the transferee shall

connection with an Acquisition Proposal to the extent that the Company becomes permitted to take the actions set forth in clause (i)

forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. References in this Agreement
to specific laws or to specific provisions of laws shall include all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any statute
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument referred to herein shall mean such statute as from time to time

by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 5.15   Counterparts.   This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original,
with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective

Section 5.16   Severability.   Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or
unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is
so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is unenforceable and a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose
of such invalid or unenforceable provision.

Section 5.17   No Agreement as Director or Officer.   Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
Shareholder has entered into this Agreement in its capacity as a shareholder of the Company, and nothing in this Agreement shall
limit, restrict or otherwise affect the ability of any Shareholder who is a director or officer of the Company to act, refrain from

Ladies and Gentlemen:
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (“Deutsche Bank”) has acted as financial advisor to Ixia (the “Company”) in
connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 30, 2017 (the “Merger Agreement”),
by and between Keysight Technologies, Inc. (”Parent”) and the Company which provides, among other
things, for (i) Parent to form a new wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”) and to cause Merger Sub to
execute a joinder to the Merger Agreement and (ii) the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, as
a result of which the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Transaction”). As set
forth more fully in the Merger Agreement, as a result of the Transaction, each share of common stock,
without par value (the “Company Common Stock”), of the Company, other than dissenting shares and shares
owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub will be converted into
the right to receive $19.65 in cash (the “Merger Consideration”).

You have requested our opinion, as investment bankers, as to the fairness of the Merger Consideration, from
a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, excluding
Parent and its affiliates.

In connection with our role as financial advisor to the Company, and in arriving at our opinion, we reviewed
certain publicly available financial and other information concerning the Company, and certain internal
analyses, financial forecasts and other information relating to the Company prepared by management of the
Company. We have also held discussions with certain senior officers of the Company regarding the
businesses and prospects of the Company. In addition, we have (i) reviewed the reported prices and trading
activity for the Company Common Stock, (ii) compared certain financial and stock market information for the
Company with, to the extent publicly available, similar information for certain other companies we considered
relevant whose securities are publicly traded, (iii) reviewed, to the extent publicly available, the financial
terms of certain recent business combinations which we deemed relevant, (iv) reviewed the Merger
Agreement, and (v) performed such other studies and analyses and considered such other factors as we
deemed appropriate.

We have not assumed responsibility for independent verification of, and have not independently verified, any
information, whether publicly available or furnished to us, concerning the Company, including, without
limitation, any financial information considered in connection with the rendering

of our opinion. Accordingly, for purposes of our opinion, we have, with your knowledge and permission,
assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of all such information. We have not conducted a
physical inspection of any of the properties or assets, and have not prepared, obtained or reviewed any
independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or
off-balance-sheet assets or liabilities), of the Company or Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries, nor
have we evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company, Parent or any of their respective subsidiaries
(or the impact of the Transaction thereon) under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters.
With respect to the financial forecasts made available to us and used in our analyses, we have assumed with
your knowledge and permission that such forecasts have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the matters
covered thereby. In rendering our opinion, we express no view as to the reasonableness of such forecasts
and projections or the assumptions on which they are based. Our opinion is necessarily based upon
economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the
date hereof. We expressly disclaim any undertaking or obligation to advise any person of any change in any
fact or matter affecting our opinion of which we become aware after the date hereof.
For purposes of rendering our opinion, we have assumed with your knowledge and permission that, in all
respects material to our analysis, the Transaction will be consummated in accordance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement, without any waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement that
would be material to our analysis. We also have assumed with your knowledge and permission that all
material governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required in connection with the
consummation of the Transaction will be obtained and that in connection with obtaining any necessary
governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents, no restrictions, terms or conditions will be
imposed that would be material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory, tax or accounting experts and
have relied on the assessments made by the Company and its other advisors with respect to such issues.
This opinion has been approved and authorized for issuance by a Deutsche Bank fairness opinion review
committee and is addressed to, and is for the use and benefit of, the Board of Directors of the Company in
connection with and for the purpose of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion is limited to the fairness
of the Merger Consideration, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock (other
than Parent and its affiliates) as of the date hereof. This opinion does not address any other terms of the
Transaction, the Merger Agreement or any other agreement entered into or to be entered into in connection
with the Transaction. You have not asked us to, and this opinion does not, address the fairness of the
Transaction, or any consideration received in connection therewith, to the holders of any other class of
securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company, nor does it address the fairness of the
contemplated benefits of the Transaction. We express no opinion as to the merits of the underlying decision
by the Company to engage in the Transaction or the relative merits of

the Transaction as compared to any alternative transactions or business strategies. Nor do we express an
opinion, and this opinion does not constitute a recommendation, as to how any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock should vote with respect to the Transaction. In addition, we do not express any view or
opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount or nature of any compensation payable to or
to be received by any of the Company’s officers, directors, or employees, or any class of such persons, in
connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise.

Deutsche Bank will be paid a fee for its services as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the
Transaction, a portion of which becomes payable upon delivery of this opinion (or would have become
payable if Deutsche Bank had advised the Board of Directors that it was unable to render this opinion) and a
substantial portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Transaction. The Company has also
agreed to reimburse Deutsche Bank for its expenses, and to indemnify Deutsche Bank against certain
liabilities, in connection with its engagement. We are an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG (together with its
affiliates, the “DB Group”). One or more members of the DB Group have, from time to time, provided, and are
currently providing, investment banking, commercial banking (including extension of credit) or other financial
services to Parent or its affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may receive, compensation,
including acting as a lender under Parent’s Credit Agreement since September 2014. The DB Group may
also provide investment and commercial banking services to Parent, the Company or their respective
affiliates in the future, for which we would expect the DB Group to receive compensation. In the ordinary
course of business, members of the DB Group may actively trade in the securities and other instruments and
obligations of Parent, the Company and their respective affiliates for their own accounts and for the accounts
of their customers. Accordingly, the DB Group may at any time hold a long or short position in such
securities, instruments and obligations.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions, it is
Deutsche Bank's opinion as investment bankers that, as of the date hereof, the Merger Consideration is fair,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock, excluding Parent and its affiliates.
 Very truly yours,

ANNEX D

CHAPTER 13 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

1300.   (a)   If the approval of the outstanding shares (Section 152) of a corporation is required for a reorganization under
subdivisions (a) and (b) or subdivision (e) or (f) of Section 1201, each shareholder of the corporation entitled to vote on the
transaction and each shareholder of a subsidiary corporation in a short-form merger may, by complying with this chapter, require the
corporation in which the shareholder holds shares to purchase for cash at their fair market value the shares owned by the shareholder
which are dissenting shares as defined in subdivision (b). The fair market value shall be determined as of the day of, and
immediately prior to, the first announcement of the terms of the proposed reorganization or short-form merger, excluding any
appreciation or depreciation in consequence of the proposed reorganization or short-form merger, as adjusted for any stock split,
reverse stock split, or share dividend that becomes effective thereafter.

    (b)   As used in this chapter, “dissenting shares” means shares to which all of the following apply:

     (1) That were not, immediately prior to the reorganization or short-form merger, listed on any national securities
exchange certified by the Commissioner of Corporations under subdivision (o) of Section 25100, and the notice
of meeting of shareholders to act upon the reorganization summarizes this section and Sections 1301, 1302, 1303
and 1304; provided, however, that this provision does not apply to any shares with respect to which there exists
any restriction on transfer imposed by the corporation or by any law or regulation; and provided, further, that this
provision does not apply to any shares where the holder of those shares is required, by the terms of the
reorganization or short-form merger, to accept for the shares anything except: (A) shares of any other corporation,
which shares, at the time the reorganization or short-form merger is effective, are listed on any national securities
exchange certified by the Commissioner of Corporations under subdivision (o) of Section 25100; (B) cash in lieu
of fractional shares described in the foregoing subparagraph (A); or (C) any combination of the shares and cash in
lieu of fractional shares described in the foregoing subparagraphs (A) and (B).

     (2) That were outstanding on the date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote on the reorganization and
(A) were not voted in favor of the reorganization or, (B) if described in paragraph (1), were voted against the
reorganization, or were held of record on the effective date of a short-form merger; provided, however, that
subparagraph (A) rather than subparagraph (B) of this paragraph applies in any case where the approval required
by Section 1201 is sought by written consent rather than at a meeting.

     (3) That the dissenting shareholder has demanded that the corporation purchase at their fair market value, in
accordance with Section 1301.

     (4) That the dissenting shareholder has submitted for endorsement, in accordance with Section 1302.

    (c)   As used in this chapter, “dissenting shareholder” means the recordholder of dissenting shares and includes a transferee
of record.

1301.   (a)   If, in the case of a reorganization, any shareholders of a corporation have a right under Section 1300, subject to
compliance with paragraphs (3) and (4) of subdivision (b) thereof, to require the corporation to purchase their shares for cash, that
corporation shall mail to each of those shareholders a notice of the approval of the reorganization by its outstanding shares (Section
152) within 10 days after the date of that approval, accompanied by a copy of Sections 1300, 1302, 1303, and 1304 and this section,
a statement of the price determined by the corporation to represent the fair market value of the dissenting shares, and a brief
description of the procedure to be followed if the shareholder desires to exercise the shareholder’s right under those sections. The
statement of price constitutes an offer by the corporation to purchase at the price stated any dissenting shares as defined in
subdivision (b) of Section 1300, unless they lose their status as dissenting shares under Section 1309.

    (b)   Any shareholder who has a right to require the corporation to purchase the shareholder’s shares for cash under Section
1300, subject to compliance with paragraphs (3) and (4) of subdivision (b) thereof, and who desires the corporation to purchase
shares shall make written demand upon the corporation for the purchase of

those shares and payment to the shareholder in cash of their fair market value. The demand is not effective for any purpose unless it
is received by the corporation or any transfer agent thereof (1) in the case of shares described in subdivision (b) of Section 1300, not
later than the date of the shareholders’ meeting to vote upon the reorganization, or (2) in any other case, within 30 days after the
date on which the notice of the approval by the outstanding shares pursuant to subdivision (a) or the notice pursuant to subdivision
(h) of Section 1110 was mailed to the shareholder. (c) The demand shall state the number and class of the shares held of record by
the shareholder which the shareholder demands that the corporation purchase and shall contain a statement of what the shareholder
claims to be the fair market value of those shares as determined pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 1300. The statement of fair
market value constitutes an offer by the shareholder to sell the shares at that price.

1302.   Within 30 days after the date on which notice of the approval by the outstanding shares or the notice pursuant to subdivision
(h) of Section 1110 was mailed to the shareholder, the shareholder shall submit to the corporation at its principal office or at the
office of any transfer agent thereof, (a) if the shares are certificated securities, the shareholder’s certificates representing any shares
which the shareholder demands that the corporation purchase, to be stamped or endorsed with a statement that the shares are
dissenting shares or to be exchanged for certificates of appropriate denomination so stamped or endorsed or (b) if the shares are
uncertificated securities, written notice of the number of shares which the shareholder demands that the corporation purchase. Upon
subsequent transfers of the dissenting shares on the books of the corporation, the new certificates, initial transaction statement, and
other written statements issued therefor shall bear a like statement, together with the name of the original dissenting holder of the
shares.

1303.   (a)   If the corporation and the shareholder agree that the shares are dissenting shares and agree upon the price of the shares,
the dissenting shareholder is entitled to the agreed price with interest thereon at the legal rate on judgments from the date of the
agreement. Any agreements fixing the fair market value of any dissenting shares as between the corporation and the holders thereof
shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation.

    (b)   Subject to the provisions of Section 1306, payment of the fair market value of dissenting shares shall be made within 30
days after the amount thereof has been agreed or within 30 days after any statutory or contractual conditions to the reorganization
are satisfied, whichever is later, and in the case of certificated securities, subject to surrender of the certificates therefor, unless
provided otherwise by agreement.

1304.   (a)   If the corporation denies that the shares are dissenting shares, or the corporation and the shareholder fail to agree upon
the fair market value of the shares, then the shareholder demanding purchase of such shares as dissenting shares or any interested
corporation, within six months after the date on which notice of the approval by the outstanding shares (Section 152) or notice
pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1110 was mailed to the shareholder, but not thereafter, may file a complaint in the superior
court of the proper county praying the court to determine whether the shares are dissenting shares or the fair market value of the
dissenting shares or both or may intervene in any action pending on such a complaint.

    (b)   Two or more dissenting shareholders may join as plaintiffs or be joined as defendants in any such action and two or
more such actions may be consolidated.

    (c)   On the trial of the action, the court shall determine the issues. If the status of the shares as dissenting shares is in issue,
the court shall first determine that issue. If the fair market value of the dissenting shares is in issue, the court shall determine, or
shall appoint one or more impartial appraisers to determine, the fair market value of the shares.

1305.   (a)   If the court appoints an appraiser or appraisers, they shall proceed forthwith to determine the fair market value per
share. Within the time fixed by the court, the appraisers, or a majority of them, shall make and file a report in the office of the clerk
of the court. Thereupon, on the motion of any party, the report shall be submitted to the court and considered on such evidence as
the court considers relevant. If the court finds the report reasonable, the court may confirm it.

    (b)   If a majority of the appraisers appointed fail to make and file a report within 10 days from the date of their appointment
or within such further time as may be allowed by the court or the report is not confirmed by the court, the court shall determine the
fair market value of the dissenting shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

    (c)   Subject to the provisions of Section 1306, judgment shall be rendered against the corporation for payment of an amount
equal to the fair market value of each dissenting share multiplied by the number of dissenting shares which any dissenting
shareholder who is a party, or who has intervened, is entitled to require the corporation to purchase, with interest thereon at the legal
rate from the date on which judgment was entered.

    (d)   Any such judgment shall be payable forthwith with respect to uncertificated securities and, with respect to certificated
securities, only upon the endorsement and delivery to the corporation of the certificates for the shares described in the judgment.
Any party may appeal from the judgment.

    (e)   The costs of the action, including reasonable compensation to the appraisers to be fixed by the court, shall be assessed or
apportioned as the court considers equitable, but, if the appraisal exceeds the price offered by the corporation, the corporation shall
pay the costs (including in the discretion of the court attorneys’ fees, fees of expert witnesses and interest at the legal rate on
judgments from the date of compliance with Sections 1300, 1301 and 1302 if the value awarded by the court for the shares is more
than 125 percent of the price offered by the corporation under subdivision (a) of Section 1301).

1306.   To the extent that the provisions of Chapter 5 prevent the payment to any holders of dissenting shares of their fair market
value, they shall become creditors of the corporation for the amount thereof together with interest at the legal rate on judgments
until the date of payment, but subordinate to all other creditors in any liquidation proceeding, such debt to be payable when
permissible under the provisions of Chapter 5.

1307.   Cash dividends declared and paid by the corporation upon the dissenting shares after the date of approval of the
reorganization by the outstanding shares (Section 152) and prior to payment for the shares by the corporation shall be credited
against the total amount to be paid by the corporation therefor.

1308.   Except as expressly limited in this chapter, holders of dissenting shares continue to have all the rights and privileges incident
to their shares, until the fair market value of their shares is agreed upon or determined. A dissenting shareholder may not withdraw a
demand for payment unless the corporation consents thereto.

1309.   Dissenting shares lose their status as dissenting shares and the holders thereof cease to be dissenting shareholders and cease
to be entitled to require the corporation to purchase their shares upon the happening of any of the following:

    (a)   The corporation abandons the reorganization. Upon abandonment of the reorganization, the corporation shall pay on
demand to any dissenting shareholder who has initiated proceedings in good faith under this chapter all necessary expenses incurred
in such proceedings and reasonable attorneys’ fees.

    (b)   The shares are transferred prior to their submission for endorsement in accordance with Section 1302 or are surrendered
for conversion into shares of another class in accordance with the articles.

    (c)   The dissenting shareholder and the corporation do not agree upon the status of the shares as dissenting shares or upon
the purchase price of the shares, and neither files a complaint or intervenes in a pending action as provided in Section 1304, within
six months after the date on which notice of the approval by the outstanding shares or notice pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section
1110 was mailed to the shareholder.

    (d)   The dissenting shareholder, with the consent of the corporation, withdraws the shareholder’s demand for purchase of the
dissenting shares.
