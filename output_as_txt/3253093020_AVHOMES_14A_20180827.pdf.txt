MERGER PROPOSAL—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT
 
Dear Fellow Stockholders:  

As previously announced, on June 7, 2018, AV Homes, Inc. (“AV Homes”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended
from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”) with Taylor Morrison Home Corporation (“Taylor Morrison”), Taylor Morrison Communities, Inc.
(“Intermediate Parent”), and Thor Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into AV Homes (the
“Merger”), with AV Homes continuing as the surviving entity in the Merger as an indirect subsidiary of Taylor Morrison.

If the Merger Agreement is adopted by AV Homes stockholders and the Merger is consummated, AV Homes stockholders will be entitled to
receive, at their election, consideration per share of common stock of AV Homes (the “AV Homes Common Stock”) consisting of (i) $21.50 in cash,
without interest (subject to the proration procedures described in this proxy statement/prospectus, the “Cash Consideration”), (ii) 0.9793 validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Taylor Morrison Class A common stock (the shares, the “Taylor Morrison Common Stock,” and the
consideration, subject to the proration procedures described in this proxy statement/prospectus, the “Stock Consideration,” respectively) or (iii) a
combination of $12.64 in cash, without interest, and 0.4034 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock (the
“Mixed Consideration,” and, together with the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”). If no election is made as
to a share of AV Homes Common Stock, the holder of that share will receive Mixed Consideration. The Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration are
subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement such that the aggregate Merger Consideration will consist of approximately 58.8%
cash and approximately 41.2% Taylor Morrison common stock, as further described in this proxy statement/prospectus under the heading “The Merger
Agreement—Merger Consideration.”

Based on Taylor Morrison’s closing stock price on August 24, 2018, the most recent practicable date for which such information was available,
the Stock Consideration represented approximately $19.25 in value per share of AV Homes Common Stock (before giving effect to any proration
adjustment), and the Mixed Consideration represented approximately $20.57 in value per share of AV Homes Common Stock, which represent a
premium of approximately 16.7% and 24.7% (before giving effect to any proration adjustment), respectively, over AV Homes’ closing stock price on
June 6, 2018, the last trading day before the public announcement of the Merger Agreement. The Cash Consideration represents a premium of
approximately 30% over AV Homes’ closing stock price on June 6, 2018 (before giving effect to any proration adjustment). The value of the Stock
Consideration and Mixed Consideration will fluctuate based on the market price of Taylor Morrison Common Stock until the completion of the Merger.
Shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”), under the ticker symbol “TMHC” and shares of
AV Homes Common Stock are traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market (the “Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “AVHI.” We urge you to obtain current
market quotations for the shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock and AV Homes Common Stock.

Based on the number of shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock and AV Homes Common Stock expected to be outstanding immediately prior
to the closing of the Merger, Taylor Morrison expects to issue approximately 9.1 million shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock (not including shares
of Taylor Morrison Common Stock issuable in connection with the settlement of Taylor Morrison restricted stock units issued to holders of AV Homes
restricted stock units in accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement or in connection with the conversion of AV Homes Convertible
Notes). The issuance is expected to result in former AV Homes stockholders owning approximately 8% and current Taylor Morrison stockholders
owning approximately 92% of outstanding Taylor Morrison Common Stock immediately after the completion of the Merger. Taylor Morrison may issue
additional shares as the result of conversions of AV Homes Convertible Notes after the completion of the Merger. See the section entitled “Treatment of
AV Homes Convertible Notes” in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus.

The Merger cannot be consummated unless AV Homes stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock, as
of the close of business on August 24, 2018 (the “Record Date”), vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the special meeting of AV
Homes stockholders (the “AV Homes special meeting”) to be held on September 26, 2018, at 8:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of AV Homes, which
are located at 6730 N. Scottsdale Rd., Suite 150, Scottsdale, AZ 85253. Your vote is very important regardless of the number of shares of AV
Homes Common Stock you own. Whether or not you expect to attend the AV Homes special meeting in person, please vote or otherwise submit
a proxy to vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares may be represented and voted at the AV Homes special meeting. TPG
Aviator, L.P., which owns approximately 41% of the outstanding shares of AV Homes, has agreed to vote all of its shares in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement.

The board of directors of AV Homes (the “AV Homes Board”) unanimously recommends that AV Homes stockholders vote FOR the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and FOR each of the other proposals to be voted on at the AV Homes special meeting, as described in
more detail in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus. In considering the recommendations of the AV Homes Board, you should be aware
that certain directors and executive officers of AV Homes will have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of
AV Homes stockholders generally. See the section entitled “Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Interests of Certain AV Homes Directors
and Officers in the Merger” beginning on page 88 of the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus.

The accompanying proxy statement/prospectus provides important information regarding the AV Homes special meeting and a detailed
description of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, and the matters to be presented at the AV Homes
special meeting. We urge you to read the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus (and any documents incorporated by reference into the
accompanying proxy statement/prospectus) carefully and in its entirety. Please pay particular attention to “Risk Factors” beginning on page 32
of the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus.

We look forward to the successful completion of the Merger.

Sincerely,

Roger A. Cregg
President and Chief Executive Officer
AV Homes, Inc.

Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved the Merger or
other transaction described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus or of the securities to be issued in connection with the Merger
described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus or determined that the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus is truthful or
complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

The accompanying proxy statement/prospectus is dated August 27, 2018 and is first being mailed to AV Homes stockholders on or about August
27, 2018.

Stock to be issued to AV Homes stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement and any Taylor Morrison Common Stock to be issued upon conversion
of AV Homes Convertible Notes after the effective time of the Merger. This proxy statement/prospectus is a part of that registration statement and
constitutes a prospectus of Taylor Morrison in addition to being a proxy statement of AV Homes for its special meeting. The registration statement,
including the attached annexes and exhibits, contains additional relevant information about Taylor Morrison and the Taylor Morrison Common Stock.
The rules and regulations of the SEC allow Taylor Morrison and AV Homes to omit certain information included in the registration statement from this

AV Homes’ SEC Filings
 

 
•  AV Homes’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2018, including

portions of AV Homes’ Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, filed with the SEC on April 18, 2018 to the extent specifically
incorporated by reference therein;

 

 
•  AV Homes’ Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on April 27, 2018, and June 30,

 •  AV Homes’ Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on June 5, 2018 and June 7, 2018 (two reports).

Beginning January 1, 2018, AV Homes adopted new accounting guidance that changed the presentation of certain items within its consolidated
statements of cash flows, including the presentation of restricted cash. The change results in a decrease/(increase) to cash flows from operations of $0.1
million, $25.7 million, and ($10.5 million) in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, with a corresponding change to total cash, cash equivalents, and
restricted cash. The $25.7 million change in 2016 related to the release of a restricted deposit on a credit facility. However, the adoption of this new
accounting guidance did not have a material impact on their consolidated financial statements and no recasting of the 2017 Form 10-K was necessary.

In addition, all documents filed by Taylor Morrison and AV Homes with the SEC under Sections 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act

information furnished in any Current Report on Form 8-K unless specifically stated otherwise.

Morrison, as well as all pro forma financial information, and AV Homes has supplied all such information relating to AV Homes.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

The following questions and answers are intended to address some commonly asked questions regarding the Merger, the Merger Agreement, certain
voting procedures and other matters with respect to the AV Homes special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may
be important to AV Homes stockholders. To better understand these matters, and for a more complete description of the terms of the Merger Agreement,
the Voting Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby including, certain risks relating to the Merger and Taylor Morrison
following the Merger, and the proceedings to be conducted at the AV Homes special meeting, you should carefully read this entire proxy
statement/prospectus, including each of the attached Annexes, as well as the documents that have been incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus. See the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” in this proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement/prospectus?
 

A: On June 7, 2018, Taylor Morrison, Intermediate Parent, Merger Sub, and AV Homes entered into the Merger Agreement that is described in this
proxy statement/prospectus. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by
reference herein. In order to complete the Merger, among other things, AV Homes stockholders must affirmatively vote to adopt the Merger
Agreement.

AV Homes is holding a special meeting of stockholders to obtain the requisite approval of its stockholders for the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and advisory, non-binding approval of certain compensation that may become payable to the named executive officers of AV Homes in
connection with the Merger. In addition, AV Homes stockholders will also be asked to approve the adjournment proposal.

This proxy statement/prospectus serves as both a proxy statement of AV Homes and a prospectus of Taylor Morrison in connection with the
Merger.

Your vote is very important. We encourage you to complete, sign, date and submit a proxy card to have your shares of AV Homes
Common Stock voted as soon as possible.

 
Q: What will happen in the Merger?
 

A: In the Merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into AV Homes, with AV Homes being the surviving corporation. As a result of the Merger,
AV Homes will become an indirect subsidiary of Taylor Morrison, Merger Sub’s separate corporate existence will cease, and AV Homes will no
longer be a publicly traded company. See “The Merger Agreement—Structure and Effect of the Merger” and the Merger Agreement attached as
Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus for more information about the Merger.

 
Q: What will AV Homes stockholders receive in the Merger?
 

A: At the effective time of the Merger each share of AV Homes Common Stock (other than restricted stock, dissenters’ shares or any shares of AV
Homes Common Stock owned directly by AV Homes (or any wholly owned subsidiary of AV Homes), Taylor Morrison or Merger Sub (which we
refer to as “Canceled Shares”)) will be converted into, at the election of the holder of each share of AV Homes Common Stock, the right to receive
consideration consisting of (i) 0.9793 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock (subject to the
proration procedures described in this proxy statement/prospectus, the “Stock Consideration”), (ii) $21.50 in cash (subject to the proration
procedures described in this proxy statement/prospectus, the “Cash Consideration”), or (iii) $12.64 in cash and 0.4034 validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock (which we refer to as the “Mixed Consideration”).

Table of Contents

Elections to receive Stock Consideration (which we refer to as “Stock Elections”), elections to receive Cash Consideration (which we refer to as
“Cash Elections”) and elections to receive Mixed Consideration (which we refer to as “Mixed Elections”), are subject to allocation and proration
procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement to ensure that the aggregate Merger Consideration will consist of approximately 58.8% cash and
approximately 41.2% Taylor Morrison Common Stock.

You will receive cash in lieu of a fractional share to which you would otherwise be entited, and you will not be entitled to dividends, voting rights
or any other rights in respect of such fractional share. For more information regarding allocation and proration procedures, see the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration.”

Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, TPG has agreed both to vote all of its shares of AV Homes Common Stock (representing approximately 41.2%
of the outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock as of Record Date) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and any action
required in furtherance thereof and to make a Stock Election with respect to all of its AV Homes Common Stock. TPG may not transfer its AV
Homes Common Stock prior to the Merger other than to an affiliate that agrees to be bound by the Voting Agreement.

Because the exchange ratio for the shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock that will be issued in the Merger is fixed and there will be no
adjustment to such exchange ratio, the aggregate value of the Merger Consideration received by AV Homes stockholders who receive Taylor
Morrison Common Stock in the Merger will depend on the then-current NYSE market price of shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock at the
effective time of the Merger. As a result, the value of the Merger Consideration that AV Homes stockholders will receive in the Merger could be
greater than, less than, or the same as, the value of such Merger Consideration on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the
AV Homes special meeting.

For more information regarding the Stock Consideration, Cash Consideration, or Mixed Consideration, as applicable, to be provided to AV Homes
stockholders (which we refer to as the “Per Share Merger Consideration”), see the section entitled “The Merger—Merger Consideration.” For
more information regarding election mechanics, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Election and Exchange Procedures.”

 
Q: I own shares of AV Homes Common Stock. How do I make an election to receive Cash Consideration, Stock Consideration or Mixed

Consideration for my shares of AV Homes Common Stock?
 

A: Prior to the closing of the Merger, AV Homes will provide a form of election to holders of record of shares of AV Homes Common Stock advising
such holders of the procedure for exercising their right to make an election.

 
Q: I own shares of AV Homes Common Stock. What is the deadline for submitting my election?
 

A: To be effective, a form of election must be properly completed, signed and submitted to the Exchange Agent by the election deadline. Unless
otherwise agreed upon in advance by the parties, the “election deadline” will be 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on the date that AV Homes and
Taylor Morrison agree is as near as practicable to two (2) business days preceding the closing date of the Merger. AV Homes stockholders are
urged to promptly submit their properly completed and signed forms of election, together with the necessary transmittal materials, as soon as those
materials become available, and not wait until the election deadline.

 
Q: I own shares of AV Homes Common Stock. How can I change or revoke my election?
 

A: You can change or revoke your election before the election deadline by written notice that is sent to and received by the Exchange Agent prior to
the election deadline accompanied by a properly completed and

signed revised form of election or by withdrawal prior to the election deadline of your certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates),
or any documents in respect of book-entry shares previously deposited with the Exchange Agent.

 
Q: I own shares of AV Homes Common Stock. What happens if I don’t make an election?
 

A: A holder of shares of AV Homes Common Stock who makes no election or an untimely election, or is otherwise deemed not to have submitted an
effective form of election, or who has validly revoked his or her merger consideration election but has not properly submitted a new duly
completed form of election, will be deemed to have made a Mixed Election.

 
Q: I own shares of AV Homes Common Stock. Can I sell my shares of AV Homes Common Stock after I make my election to receive cash or

stock?
 

A: Yes, but, after an election is validly made, any subsequent transfer of AV Homes Common Stock will automatically revoke such election.
Following such revocation, unless a subsequent election is made, the holder of such shares shall be deemed to have made a Mixed Election with
respect to such shares.

 
Q: If I elect to receive Cash Consideration, under what circumstances will my cash be prorated and how will proration be calculated?
 

A: If (i) the product of the number of shares pursuant to which a Cash Election was made (which we refer to as “Cash Electing Shares”) multiplied by
the Cash Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment) (which we refer to as the “Cash Election Amount”) exceeds (ii) the product of the
aggregate number of issued and outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock (other than Canceled Shares) multiplied by $12.64 minus the
aggregate amount of cash to be paid in respect of all shares pursuant to which a Mixed Election is made (which we refer to as the “Available Cash
Election Amount”), then the following consideration will be paid in respect of each Cash Electing Share:

 

 

•  an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the Cash Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment) multiplied by (ii) the greater of
(a) a fraction, rounded to four (4) decimal places, the numerator of which is the Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of
which is the Cash Election Amount and (b) zero (0) (we refer to the amount calculated in clause (ii) of this paragraph as the “Cash
Fraction”); and

 

 
•  a number of shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the Stock Consideration (before giving effect to any

adjustment) multiplied by (ii) the result of one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.

 
Q: If I elect to receive Stock Consideration, under what circumstances will my stock be prorated and how will proration be calculated?
 

A: If the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then the following consideration will be paid in respect of each share
pursuant to which a Stock Election is made (which we refer to as “Stock Electing Shares”):

 

 
•  an amount of cash equal to the result of (i) the amount of such excess divided by (ii) the number of Stock Electing Shares (which we refer to

as the “Prorated Cash Amount”); and
 

 

•  a number of shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the Stock Consideration (before giving effect to any
adjustment) multiplied by (ii) a fraction, rounded to four (4) decimal places, the numerator of which is the difference between (a) the Cash
Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment) and (b) the Prorated Cash Amount and the denominator of which is the Cash
Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment).

Q: What happens if the Merger is not completed?
 

A: If the Merger is not completed for any reason, AV Homes stockholders will not receive any Merger Consideration for their shares of AV Homes
Common Stock, and AV Homes will remain an independent public company with AV Homes Common Stock continuing to be traded on Nasdaq.
For a discussion of the fees payable in the event the Merger is not completed, see “Fees and Expenses and Termination Fees.”

 
Q: When and where will the AV Homes special meeting be held?
 

A: The AV Homes special meeting will be held on September 26, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. local time, at the offices of AV Homes, which are located at 6730
N. Scottsdale Rd., Suite 150, Scottsdale, AZ 85253.

 
Q: What are AV Homes stockholders being asked to vote on?
 

A: AV Homes stockholders are being asked to vote on:
 

 

•  Proposal I: a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into AV Homes, with AV Homes
continuing as the surviving corporation in such Merger, such that the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, AV Homes no
longer will be a publicly traded company, and the business and subsidiaries of AV Homes will become indirect subsidiaries of Taylor
Morrison; and

 

 
•  Proposal II: a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may become payable to the named

executive officers of AV Homes in connection with the Merger; and
 

 •  Proposal III: the adjournment proposal.

The adoption by AV Homes stockholders of the Merger Agreement is a condition to the obligations of Taylor Morrison and of AV Homes to
complete the Merger. The approval of the advisory compensation proposal and the adjournment proposal are not conditions to the obligations of
Taylor Morrison or of AV Homes to complete the Merger.

 
Q: Who is entitled to vote at the AV Homes special meeting?
 

A: AV Homes has one class of voting stock issued and outstanding, the AV Homes Common Stock, which votes on all matters presented to AV
Homes stockholders for their vote or approval. Only holders of record of AV Homes Common Stock as of the Record Date, the close of business
on August 24, 2018, are entitled to vote at the AV Homes special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

As of the Record Date, there were 22,360,366 shares of AV Homes Common Stock outstanding. Each outstanding share of AV Homes Common
Stock is entitled to one vote on each matter to be acted upon at the AV Homes special meeting.

 
Q: How does the AV Homes Board recommend that AV Homes stockholders vote?
 

A: At a meeting of the AV Homes Board held on June 6, 2018, at which all of the AV Homes directors were present, the AV Homes Board
unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are
advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, AV Homes and its stockholders, and approved, adopted, and declared advisable the Merger
Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger.

The AV Homes Board recommends that AV Homes stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the Merger Agreement, FOR the named
executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal and FOR the adjournment proposal. See “Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement—AV Homes’ Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the AV Homes Board of Directors,” “Proposal II: Advisory

Vote on Named Executive Officer Merger-Related Compensation” and “Proposal III: Adjournment of AV Homes Special Meeting” beginning on
pages 53, 124 and 125, respectively, of this proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Q: What AV Homes stockholder vote is required for the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the adjournment proposal, and

what happens if I abstain?
 

A: The following are the vote requirements:
 

 

•  Adoption of the Merger Agreement: The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock is required to adopt the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, shares deemed not in attendance
at the AV Homes special meeting, whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting
instructions to such holder’s nominee or intermediary, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against the
adoption of the Merger Agreement.

 

 

•  Approval of Executive Pay: The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the votes which could be cast which are
present in person or by proxy at the meeting is required to adopt the proposal. Accordingly, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote
against the proposal, but shares deemed not in attendance at the meeting, whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name”
holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s nominee or intermediary, and broker non-votes will have no effect on the
proposal.

 

 

•  Adjournment of AV Homes Special Meeting: The affirmative vote of holders of shares entitling them to exercise a majority of the voting
power that is present in person or by proxy at any special meeting, even if such majority represents less than a quorum, is required to
approve the adjournment proposal. Accordingly, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal, but shares deemed not
in attendance at the meeting, whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting
instructions to such holder’s nominee or intermediary, and broker non-votes will have no effect on the proposal.

 
Q: How many votes do I and others have? Are any AV Homes stockholders already committed to vote in favor of the proposals?
 

A: Holders of AV Homes Common Stock vote on all matters presented to AV Homes stockholders for their vote or approval, including the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement and the adjournment proposal to be presented at the AV Homes special meeting. Holders of AV Homes Common
Stock are entitled to one vote for each share of AV Homes Common Stock owned as of the Record Date. As of the Record Date, there were
22,360,366 outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock, and TPG held 9,215,017 shares of AV Homes Common Stock.

In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, TPG entered into the Voting Agreement with Taylor Morrison. As of the Record Date,

Table of Contents

Q: Why are the Merger Agreement and the Merger not being considered and voted upon by Taylor Morrison’ stockholders?
 

A: Under Delaware law, Taylor Morrison stockholders are not required to consider and vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. Under NYSE rules,
stockholder approval is required prior to the issuance by an NYSE-listed issuer of common stock in a business combination transaction if the
number of shares of common stock to be issued in the business combination equals 20% or more of the number of shares of common stock
outstanding before such issuance. The issuance by Taylor Morrison in the Merger of up to approximately 14.0 million shares of Taylor Morrison
Common Stock will not equal 20% or more of the total issued and outstanding shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock at the time of issuance.

 
Q: Are there any important risks related to the Merger or Taylor Morrison’s or AV Homes’ businesses of which I should be aware?
 

A: Yes, there are important risks related to the Merger and each of Taylor Morrison’s and AV Homes’ businesses. Before making any decision on how
to vote, Taylor Morrison and AV Homes urge you to read carefully and in its entirety the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this proxy
statement/prospectus. You also should read and carefully consider the risk factors relating to Taylor Morrison and AV Homes contained in the
documents that are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, including Taylor Morrison’s and AV Homes’ respective Annual
Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, as updated from time to time in each company’s subsequent filings with the
SEC.

 
Q: Do AV Homes directors and officers have interests that may differ from those of other AV Homes stockholders?
 

A: Yes. In considering the recommendation of the AV Homes Board that AV Homes stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the Merger Agreement,
AV Homes stockholders should be aware and take into account the fact that certain AV Homes directors and executive officers have interests in
the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of AV Homes stockholders generally. The AV Homes Board was aware of
and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the terms and structure, and overseeing the negotiation of, the Merger, in
approving the Merger Agreement and in recommending that AV Homes stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the Merger Agreement. See
“Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Interests of Certain AV Homes Directors and Officers in the Merger.”

 
Q: What constitutes a quorum for the AV Homes special meeting?
 

A: A quorum of outstanding shares is necessary to take action at the AV Homes special meeting. The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of
stock having a majority of the voting power of AV Homes will constitute a quorum at the AV Homes special meeting. The inspector of election
appointed for the AV Homes special meeting will determine whether a quorum is present.

 
Q: How do I vote?
 

A: If you are a stockholder of record as of the Record Date for the AV Homes special meeting, you may attend the AV Homes special meeting and
vote your shares in person. You also may choose to submit your proxies by any of the following methods:

 

 
•  By Mail. If you choose to submit your proxy to vote by mail, simply complete the enclosed proxy card, date and sign it, and return it in the

postage-paid envelope provided;
 

 
•  By Telephone. You may submit your proxy to vote your shares by telephone by calling the toll-free number provided on your proxy card any

time up to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, on September 25, 2018; or

•  Through the Internet. You may also submit your proxy to vote through the Internet by signing on to the website identified on your proxy

card and following the procedures described in the website any time up to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, on September 25, 2018.

If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares in street name, or through a nominee or intermediary, such as a bank or broker, you will receive
separate instructions from such nominee or intermediary describing how to vote your shares. The availability of telephonic or Internet voting will
depend on the intermediary’s voting process. Please check with your nominee or intermediary and follow the voting instructions provided by your
nominee or intermediary with these materials.

 
Q: What is a “broker non-vote”?
 

A: If a holder of AV Homes Common Stock is a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name” by a bank, broker, trust company or other nominee
and does not provide the organization that holds its shares with specific voting instructions, then, under applicable rules, the organization that
holds its shares may generally vote on “routine” matters but cannot vote on “non-routine” matters. The proposals to be voted on at the AV Homes
special meeting are “non-routine” matters. If the organization that holds the beneficial owner’s shares does not receive instructions from such AV
Homes stockholder on how to vote its shares on any of the proposals to be voted on at the AV Homes special meeting, that bank, broker, trust
company or other nominee will inform the inspector of election at the AV Homes special meeting that it does not have authority to vote on any
proposal at the AV Homes special meeting with respect to such shares, and, furthermore, such shares will not be deemed to be in attendance at the
meeting. However, if the bank, broker, trust company or other nominee receives instructions from such AV Homes stockholder on how to vote its
shares as to only one or two proposals, the shares will be voted as instructed on such proposal(s) but will not be voted on the other, uninstructed
proposal(s). This is generally referred to as a “broker non-vote.”

 
Q: If my shares are held in street name, will my nominee or intermediary automatically vote my shares for me?
 

A: No. If your shares of AV Homes Common Stock are held in street name, you must instruct your nominee or intermediary how to vote your shares.
Your nominee or intermediary will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by properly completing the voting instruction
form sent to you by your nominee or intermediary with this proxy statement/prospectus.

 
Q: What will happen if I return my proxy card without indicating how to vote?
 

A: If you return your signed and dated proxy card without indicating how to vote your shares on any particular proposal, the AV Homes Common
Stock represented by your proxy will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the AV Homes Board.

 
Q: Is my vote important?
 

A: Yes, your vote is very important. The Merger cannot be completed without the adoption of the Merger Agreement by AV Homes stockholders.

The AV Homes Board recommends that AV Homes stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

 
Q: Can I revoke my proxy or change my voting instructions?
 

A: Yes. You may revoke your proxy or change your vote, at any time, before your proxy is voted at the AV Homes special meeting.

Table of Contents

If you are a holder of record as of the Record Date, you can revoke your proxy or change your vote by:
 

 
•  sending a written notice stating that you revoke your proxy to the Corporate Secretary of AV Homes, at AV Homes’ offices at 6730 N.

Scottsdale Road Suite 150, Scottsdale, AZ 85253, Attention: Corporate Secretary, that bears a date later than the date of the previously
submitted proxy that you want to revoke and is received by AV Homes’ Corporate Secretary prior to the AV Homes special meeting;

 

 •  submitting a valid, later-dated proxy via mail, over the telephone or through the Internet; or
 

 
•  attending the AV Homes special meeting and voting in person, which will automatically cancel any proxy previously given, or revoking

your proxy in person, but your attendance alone will not constitute a vote or revoke any proxy previously given.

If you hold your shares in street name, you must contact your nominee or intermediary to change your vote or obtain a legal proxy to vote your
shares if you wish to cast your vote in person at the AV Homes special meeting.

 
Q: What happens if I transfer my shares of AV Homes Common Stock before the AV Homes special meeting?
 

A: The Record Date is earlier than the date of the AV Homes special meeting and the date that the Merger is expected to be completed. If you transfer
your shares of AV Homes Common Stock after the Record Date, but before the AV Homes special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at
the AV Homes special meeting. However, you will have transferred the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the Merger. In order to receive
the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares of AV Homes Common Stock through the effective time of the Merger. In addition, after an
election is validly made, any subsequent transfer of AV Homes Common Stock will automatically revoke such election. Following such
revocation, unless a subsequent election is made, the holder of such shares shall be deemed to have made a Mixed Election with respect to such
shares.

 
Q: What do I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement/prospectus, the proxy card or the voting
instruction form. This can occur if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, if you hold shares directly as a holder of record and
also in street name, or otherwise through another holder of record, and in certain other circumstances. If you receive more than one set of voting
materials, please vote or return each set separately in order to ensure that all of your shares are voted.

 
Q: What will happen if all of the proposals to be considered at the AV Homes special meeting are not approved?
 

A: As a condition to completion of the Merger, AV Homes stockholders must adopt the Merger Agreement at the AV Homes special meeting.
Completion of the Merger is not conditioned or dependent upon the approval of either the proposal regarding certain compensation that may
become payable to the named executive officers of AV Homes in connection with the Merger or the adjournment proposal.

 
Q: Are AV Homes stockholders entitled to appraisal rights if they do not vote FOR the adoption of the Merger Agreement?
 

A: Yes. Under Delaware law, record holders of AV Homes Common Stock who neither vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor
consent thereto in writing, who continuously hold their shares of AV Homes Common Stock through the effective time of the Merger and who
otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger, and
if the Merger is completed, subject to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, obtain payment in cash of the fair value of their shares of AV
Homes Common Stock as determined by the

Delaware Court of Chancery, instead of receiving the Merger Consideration for their shares. Under Section 262 of the DGCL, assuming AV
Homes Common Stock remains listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, the Delaware Court
of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who have perfected their appraisal rights unless (i) the total number of
shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in
the Merger for such total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds $1 million. To exercise appraisal rights, AV Homes stockholders must
comply with the procedures prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL. These procedures are summarized under “Appraisal Rights.” In addition, a
copy of the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus. Failure to comply with these
provisions may result in a loss of the right of appraisal.

 
Q: What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders of AV Homes Common Stock?
 

A: The exchange of AV Homes Common Stock for cash, Taylor Morrison Common Stock or both in the Merger generally will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable under state, local or other tax laws. You should read the section entitled
“Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger” for more information. Tax
matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the Merger to you will depend on your particular circumstances. You are urged to consult
your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to you in your particular circumstances, as well as tax
consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

 
Q: What are the conditions to the completion of the Merger?
 

A: Completion of the Merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the (i) adoption of the Merger Agreement by AV
Homes stockholders; (ii) effectiveness of the registration statement under the Securities Act of which this proxy statement/prospectus is a part; and
(iii) satisfaction (or to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver) of other customary conditions to closing. See “The Merger Agreement—
Conditions to Completion of the Merger” for more information.

 
Q: When is the Merger expected to be completed?
 

A: As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, it is not possible to accurately estimate the closing date of the Merger because the Merger is
subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver) of the conditions to Taylor Morrison’s and AV Homes’ obligations
to complete the Merger, some of which are not within the control of such parties; however, Taylor Morrison and AV Homes currently expect the
Merger to close late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of 2018. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to when, or if, the Merger
will be completed.

 
Q: Do I need to do anything at this time with my shares of AV Homes Common Stock other than voting on the proposals at the AV Homes special

meeting?
 

A: If you are an AV Homes stockholder, you will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for your shares after the effective time of the Merger
(assuming you do not properly exercise your appraisal rights in respect of such shares as described under “Appraisal Rights”). However, there is
no action that you are requested to take at this time, other than affirmatively voting FOR the adoption of the Merger Agreement, FOR the named
executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal and FOR the adjournment proposal in accordance with one of the methods of voting set
forth in “AV Homes Special Meeting—Voting of Shares.”

Table of Contents

Q: Should I send in my AV Homes stock certificates now to receive the Merger Consideration?
 

A: No. AV Homes stockholders should not send in their stock certificates to any person at this time. After the effective time of the Merger, the
Exchange Agent will send you a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging your shares of AV Homes Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration. See “Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Exchange of Shares in the Merger.”

 
Q: Is the completion of the Merger subject to a financing condition?
 

A: No. The receipt of any financing by Taylor Morrison is not a condition to completion of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement and, except in certain limited circumstances in which Taylor Morrison or AV Homes may be permitted to terminate the
Merger Agreement (as more fully described in “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement”), Taylor Morrison will be
required to complete the Merger (assuming that all of the conditions to its obligations to complete the Merger under the Merger Agreement are
satisfied or waived) whether or not financing is available on acceptable terms or at all. Taylor Morrison currently intends to pay the cash portion of
the Merger Consideration and pay related fees and expenses in connection with the Merger using the proceeds of draws under its revolving credit
facility, the proceeds of a new bond issuance and/or cash on hand at the time of closing. In addition, Taylor Morrison has a commitment for a
364-day term loan if a new bond offering is not completed at or prior to the time of closing. The term loan, if drawn upon, would be a
$200.0 million unsecured facility with Intermediate Parent as borrower, bearing interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from
1.50% to 2.00% or the base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.50% to 1.00%. The term loan would mature 364 days after the closing date of the
Merger and have covenants substantially the same as those under Taylor Morrison’s existing credit facility.

 
Q: How will AV Homes’ outstanding indebtedness be treated in the Merger?
 

A: Upon closing of the Merger, AV Homes’ existing revolving credit facility will be terminated and any amounts outstanding thereunder will be
repaid using cash from AV Homes’ balance sheet. The AV Homes 6.625% Notes are expected to remain outstanding following the Merger. The
Merger constitutes a “Fundamental Change” for purposes of the indenture governing the AV Homes Convertible Notes. Upon the occurrence of a
Fundamental Change, the holders of the AV Homes Convertible Notes can cause AV Homes (or its successor) to repurchase the AV Homes
Convertible Notes at a price equal to 100% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of
repurchase. Holders of the AV Homes Convertible Notes may also convert them at an increased conversion rate in connection with the Merger,
and if such conversion occurs with respect to all of the AV Homes Convertible Notes, such holders would be entitled to the Merger Consideration
that would be paid to holders of a total of approximately 4.4 million shares of AV Homes Common Stock. The form of such Merger Consideration
would be the form elected by holders of a plurality of the AV Homes Common Stock. Such Merger Consideration would consist of (i) an
aggregate of approximately $95.0 million in cash if holders of a plurality of AV Homes Common Stock elect to receive all of the Merger
Consideration in cash, (ii) an aggregate of approximately 4.3 million shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock if holders of a plurality of such AV
Homes Common Stock elect to receive all of the Merger Consideration in Taylor Morrison Common Stock and (iii) an aggregate of approximately
$55.8 million in cash and approximately 1.8 million shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock if holders of a plurality of such AV Homes
Common Stock elect to receive mixed cash and stock consideration. The combined company expects to fund any required additional cash
payments from additional borrowings under its revolving credit facility.

The consideration deliverable upon conversion of AV Homes Convertible Notes as described in the preceding paragraph assumes that the Merger
closes on October 1, 2018, and the average closing price of the AV Homes Common Stock on the last five trading days preceding the closing date
is $21.50. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the AV Homes Convertible Notes, the number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the AV Homes Convertible Notes will vary based on the date of closing of the Merger and such average closing price.
Any AV Homes Convertible Notes that are not repurchased or converted will remain outstanding.

Q: Will the Taylor Morrison Common Stock issued to AV Homes stockholders at the time of completion of the Merger be traded on an exchange?

Merger be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. Shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock are currently traded

AV Homes Special Meeting (See page 47)

General

The AV Homes special meeting will be held on September 26, 2018, at 8:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of AV Homes, which are located at
6730 N. Scottsdale Rd., Suite 150, Scottsdale, AZ 85253. At the AV Homes special meeting, AV Homes stockholders will consider and vote on:
 

 
•  Proposal I: the adoption of the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into AV Homes, with AV Homes

continuing as the surviving entity in the Merger as a subsidiary of Taylor Morrison;
 

 
•  Proposal II: to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may become payable to the named executive

officers of AV Homes in connection with the Merger; and
 

 •  Proposal III: the adjournment proposal.

The adoption of the Merger Agreement by AV Homes stockholders is a condition to the obligations of Taylor Morrison and of AV Homes to
complete the Merger.

Record Date

The AV Homes Board has fixed the close of business on August 24, 2018 as the Record Date for determination of the AV Homes
stockholders entitled to vote at the AV Homes special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Only AV Homes stockholders of
record on the Record Date are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the AV Homes special meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof.

As of the Record Date, there were 22,360,366 shares of AV Homes Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the AV Homes special
meeting, held by approximately 2,295 holders of record. With respect to each matter to be acted upon at the AV Homes special meeting, each
holder of AV Homes Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each outstanding share of AV Homes Common Stock held by such holder. As
described in detail under the heading “The Voting Agreement,” Taylor Morrison and TPG entered into a voting agreement pursuant to which, among
other things, TPG agreed to vote all outstanding AV Homes Common Stock currently held or thereafter acquired by TPG in favor of the adoption
of the Merger Agreement.

Quorum

A quorum of outstanding shares is necessary to take action at the AV Homes special meeting. The presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of AV Homes Common Stock having a majority of the votes that could be cast by the holders of AV Homes Common Stock entitled to vote
at the AV Homes special meeting will constitute a quorum at the AV Homes special meeting. Shares held by a beneficial owner in “street name”
who does not give the nominee or other intermediary that holds such shares instructions on how to vote such shares on any proposal to be voted on
at the AV Homes special meeting (a “broker non-vote”) will not be deemed to be in attendance at the meeting or counted for purposes of
determining whether a quorum has been achieved. However, abstentions will be counted as present in determining the existence of a quorum.

Adoption of the Merger Agreement

  

Approval requires the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy,
of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of AV
Homes Common Stock.

Proposal II

  

Non-Binding Approval of Executive Pay

  

Approval requires the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy,
of holders of a majority of the votes that could be cast that are
present in person or by proxy at the meeting.

Proposal III

  

Adjournment of AV Homes Special Meeting (if Necessary or
Appropriate)

  

Approval requires the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy,
of holders of a majority of the votes that could be cast that are
present in person or by proxy at the meeting.

 
* Under the rules of Nasdaq, if you hold your shares of AV Homes Common Stock in street name, your nominee or intermediary may not vote

your shares without instructions from you. If you do not provide voting instructions on any Proposal, your shares will not be deemed in
attendance at the AV Homes special meeting and will not be voted. If you provide voting instructions on fewer than all three Proposals, a broker
non-vote will occur with respect to whichever Proposal(s) you did not provide voting instructions for. Abstentions will have the same effect as a
vote against the applicable Proposal(s). Shares deemed not in attendance at the meeting, whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote in
person or by proxy or a “street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s nominee or intermediary, and broker
non-votes, will have the same effect as a vote against Proposal I but will have no effect on Proposal II or Proposal III.

Share Ownership of and Voting by AV Homes Directors and Executive Officers

At the Record Date, AV Homes’ directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned and had the right to vote at the AV
Homes special meeting an aggregate of 1,254,014 shares of AV Homes Common Stock, which represents 5.6% of the voting power of the
outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock entitled to vote at the AV Homes special meeting.

It is expected that AV Homes’ directors and executive officers will vote their respective shares FOR the adoption of the Merger Agreement,
FOR the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and FOR the approval of the adjournment proposal.

The Merger Agreement and the Merger

In the Merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into AV Homes, with AV Homes being the surviving corporation in the Merger. As a
result of the Merger, AV Homes will become an indirect subsidiary of Taylor Morrison.

The Merger will not be completed without the adoption of the Merger Agreement by AV Homes stockholders.

Table of Contents

A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to read the Merger Agreement
in its entirety because it is the legal document that governs the Merger. For more information on the Merger and the Merger Agreement, see
“Proposal I: Adoption of The Merger Agreement” and “The Merger Agreement.”

As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, it is not possible to accurately estimate the closing date for the Merger because the Merger
is subject to the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver) of the conditions to Taylor Morrison’s and AV Homes’
obligations to complete the Merger, some of which are not within the control of such parties; however, Taylor Morrison and AV Homes currently
expect the Merger to close late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter of 2018. No assurance can be given as to when, or if, the Merger
will be completed.

The Voting Agreement (See page 121)

On June 7, 2018, Taylor Morrison and TPG entered into a Voting Agreement (which we refer to as the “Voting Agreement”).

Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, TPG has agreed to, among other things, vote all shares of AV Homes Common Stock held by it (i) in favor
of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and any action required in furtherance thereof, (ii) against approval of any proposal made in opposition
to, in competition with, or that would result in a breach of the Merger Agreement or the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, and (iii) against certain other actions that are intended or would reasonably be expected to prevent, interfere with, or materially
impair or delay, the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. TPG has also agreed to
elect Stock Consideration with respect to all of its AV Homes Common Stock.

The Voting Agreement will terminate automatically on the first to occur of (i) a change in the recommendation of the AV Homes Board,
(ii) certain amendments or waivers of the Merger Agreement without TPG’s prior consent, (iii) the effective time of the Merger and (iv) the
termination of the Merger Agreement.

See “The Voting Agreement.”

Merger Consideration (See page 101)

At the effective time of the Merger, each share of AV Homes Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares, as defined below under “The
Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration”) will be converted into the right to receive at the election of the holder of each share (a) Stock
Consideration, consisting of 0.9793 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock before giving effect to
any proration adjustment, (b) Cash Consideration, consisting of $21.50 in cash before giving effect to any proration adjustment, or (c) Mixed
Consideration, consisting of $12.64 in cash, without any interest thereon, and 0.4034 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Taylor
Morrison Common Stock.

Each AV Homes stockholder will, until the election deadline, be entitled to elect to receive either Cash Consideration, Stock Consideration,
or Mixed Consideration, in exchange for each share of AV Homes Common Stock held by him or her that was issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the election deadline (other than any Excluded Shares), subject to allocation and proration procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement.
AV Homes stockholders (other than in their capacity as holders of Excluded Shares) who make no election or an untimely election (or who
otherwise are deemed not to have submitted an effective form of election) will be deemed to have elected for Mixed Consideration.

Table of Contents

Stock Elections, Cash Elections and Mixed Elections are subject to the allocation and proration procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement
to ensure that the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration will consist of approximately 58.8% cash and approximately 41.2% Taylor Morrison
Common Stock.

For more information see “The Merger Agreement.”

AV Homes’ Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the AV Homes Board of Directors (See page 68)

In evaluating the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the AV Homes Board consulted with AV Homes’
senior management and AV Homes’ outside legal counsel and financial advisors. After consideration, the members of the AV Homes Board
unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are
advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of, AV Homes and its stockholders, and approved, adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement
and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the proposed Merger. For more information regarding the factors
considered by the AV Homes Board in reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, see “Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—AV Homes’ Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the AV Homes Board of
Directors.”

The AV Homes Board recommends that AV Homes stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the Merger Agreement, FOR the named
executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal and FOR the adjournment proposal.

Opinion of AV Homes’ Financial Advisor, J.P. Morgan (See page 73)

In connection with the Merger, AV Homes’ financial advisor, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, referred to as J.P. Morgan, delivered a written

whereby Moelis excludes significant stockholders from its fairness opinions in certain circumstances, including where a significant stockholder

Interests of Certain AV Homes Directors and Officers in the Merger (See page 88)

In considering the recommendation of the AV Homes Board that AV Homes stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the Merger Agreement,
AV Homes stockholders should be aware and take into account the fact that certain AV Homes directors and executive officers have interests in the
Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of AV Homes stockholders generally. These interests include, among others,
potential severance benefits and other payments, the treatment of outstanding equity awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and certain
indemnification rights of AV Homes directors and officers under the Merger Agreement. The directors and executive officers of AV Homes will
also be entitled to certain indemnification rights under the Merger Agreement.

The AV Homes Board was aware of and carefully considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the terms and structure, and
overseeing the negotiation of the Merger, in approving the Merger Agreement and in recommending that the AV Homes stockholders vote FOR the
adoption of the merger agreement. For additional information about these interests, see “Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Interests
of Certain AV Homes Directors and Officers in the Merger.”

Board of Directors and Management Following the Merger (See page 91)

The board of directors and executive officers of Taylor Morrison are not expected to change as a result of the consummation of the Merger.
For information on Taylor Morrison’s current directors and executive officers, please see Taylor Morrison’s proxy statement for its 2018 annual
meeting of stockholders filed with the SEC on May 11, 2018 and its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 19, 2018. See “Where
You Can Find More Information.”

Treatment of AV Homes Convertible Notes (See page 91)

The Merger constitutes a “Fundamental Change” for purposes of the indenture governing the AV Homes Convertible Notes. Upon the
occurrence of a Fundamental Change, the holders of the AV Homes Convertible Notes can cause AV Homes (or its successor) to repurchase the AV
Homes Convertible Notes at a price equal to 100% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the
date of repurchase.

Holders of the AV Homes Convertible Notes may also convert them at an increased conversion rate in connection with the Merger, and if
such conversion occurs with respect to all of the AV Homes Convertible Notes, such holders would be entitled to the Merger Consideration that
would be paid to holders of a total of approximately 4.4 million shares of AV Homes Common Stock. The form of such Merger Consideration
would be the form elected by holders of a plurality of the AV Homes Common Stock. Such Merger Consideration would consist of (i) an aggregate
of approximately $95.0 million in cash if holders of a plurality of AV Homes Common Stock elect to receive all of the Merger Consideration in
cash, (ii) an aggregate of approximately 4.3 million shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock if holders of a plurality of such AV Homes Common
Stock elect to receive all of the Merger Consideration in Taylor Morrison Common Stock and (iii) an aggregate of

Table of Contents

approximately $55.8 million in cash and approximately 1.8 million shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock if holders of a plurality of such AV
Homes Common Stock elect to receive mixed cash and stock consideration. The combined company expects to fund any required additional cash
payments from additional borrowings under its revolving credit facility.

The consideration deliverable upon conversion of AV Homes Convertible Notes as described in the preceding paragraph assumes that the
Merger closes on October 1, 2018, and the average closing price of the AV Homes Common Stock on the last five trading days preceding the
closing date is $21.50. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the AV Homes Convertible Notes, the number of shares of AV Homes
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the AV Homes Convertible Notes will vary based on the date of closing of the Merger and such
average closing price. Any AV Homes Convertible Notes that are not repurchased or converted will remain outstanding.

Treatment of AV Homes Equity Awards (See page 114)

AV Homes Options. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding option to purchase shares of AV Homes Common Stock will be
converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration (before giving effect to
any proration adjustment) over the exercise price per share of such option and (ii) the number of shares subject to such option.

AV Homes Restricted Stock Awards. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding AV Homes restricted stock award will be
substituted with a Taylor Morrison restricted stock award corresponding to a number of whole shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock (rounded
to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock subject to the AV Homes restricted stock
award (assuming that any performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such award are fully achieved) and (ii) the Stock Consideration
(before giving effect to any proration adjustment). Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, each Taylor Morrison restricted stock
award will continue to have the same vesting and acceleration of vesting terms and conditions (other than any performance-based vesting
conditions) as, and other terms and conditions that are substantially similar to, those that applied to the corresponding AV Homes restricted stock
award.

AV Homes RSU Awards. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of AV Homes
Common Stock (referred to as an “AV Homes RSU award”) that is held by an employee of AV Homes or its subsidiaries will be substituted with a
Taylor Morrison restricted stock unit, corresponding to a number of whole shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole
share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock subject to the AV Homes award (assuming that any
performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such award are achieved at target levels) and (ii) the Stock Consideration (before giving effect
to any proration adjustment). Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, each Taylor Morrison restricted stock unit will continue to
have the same vesting and acceleration of vesting terms and conditions (other than any performance-based vesting conditions) as, and other terms
and conditions that are substantially similar to, those that applied to the corresponding AV Homes RSU award.

At the effective time of the Merger, each AV Homes RSU award held by a non-employee director of AV Homes will be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration (before giving effect to any proration adjustment) in respect of each share of AV Homes Common Stock
underlying such award.

Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (See page 91)

The exchange of AV Homes Common Stock for a cash, Taylor Morrison Common Stock or both in the Merger generally will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be taxable

under state and local and other tax laws. You should read the section entitled “Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.” Tax matters can be complicated and the tax consequences of the Merger to you will depend on
your particular circumstances. You are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to you
in your particular circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger (See page 97)

In accordance with GAAP, Taylor Morrison will account for the Merger using the acquisition method of accounting, with Taylor Morrison
being considered the acquirer of AV Homes for accounting purposes. This means that Taylor Morrison will allocate the purchase price to the fair
value of AV Homes tangible and intangible assets and liabilities at the acquisition date, with the excess purchase price, if any, being recorded as
goodwill. Under the acquisition method of accounting, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. The operating
results of AV Homes will be reported as part of the combined company beginning on the closing date of the Merger. The final valuation of the
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been completed and is not required to be completed under
applicable guidance until 12 months after completion of the Merger. The finalization of the valuation could result in significantly different
amortization expenses and balance sheet classifications than those presented in Taylor Morrison’s unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Regulatory Approvals Required to Complete the Merger (See page 97)

Taylor Morrison has determined that no authorizations, approvals or consents from regulatory authorities are required to enable them to
complete the Merger. For a more complete discussion of regulatory matters relating to the Merger, see “Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement—Regulatory Approvals Required to Complete the Merger.”

Litigation Relating to the Merger (See page 97)

Two purported class action complaints related to the Merger have been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware
on behalf of putative classes of AV Homes’ public shareholders. The two complaints are captioned: Franchi v. AV Homes, Inc., Case No. 18 Civ.
01161, which was filed on August 3, 2018; and Zucker v. AV Homes, Inc., et al., No. 18 Civ. 01091, which was filed on July 24, 2018. Both
complaints name as defendants AV Homes and its directors, as well as Taylor Morrison, and the Franchi complaint also names Intermediate Parent
and Merger Sub as defendants. The complaints generally allege that AV Homes and its directors and Taylor Morrison violated federal securities
laws by failing to disclose material information in the version of this proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on July 13, 2018. The Franchi
complaint also alleges that the omissions constitute violations of federal securities laws by Intermediate Parent and Merger Sub. The complaints
seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Merger, damages, and an award of plaintiffs’ expenses and
attorneys’ fees. The defendants believe that the claims respectively asserted against them are wholly without merit.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger is Subject to Certain Conditions (See page 115)

As more fully described in this proxy statement/prospectus and in the Merger Agreement, the obligations of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes
to complete the Merger are subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including the following:
 

 
•  the adoption of the Merger Agreement by AV Homes stockholders at the AV Homes Special Meeting (or at any adjournment or

postponement thereof);

•  the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part and the absence of a stop order in

respect thereof or proceedings initiated or threatened by the SEC related thereto;
 

 
•  the approval for listing on NYSE of the shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and such other shares of

Taylor Morrison Common Stock to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Merger;
 

 

•  the absence of any temporary, preliminary or permanent restraining order, injunction or other order issued by any court of competent
jurisdiction or any other government entity restraining, enjoining, preventing or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and the absence of any law enacted, promulgated or deemed
applicable to the Merger by any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction restraining, enjoining, preventing or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger;

 

 
•  subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the respective representations and warranties of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes, and

compliance by Taylor Morrison and AV Homes with their respective covenants, in each case, as set forth in the Merger Agreement;
 

 •  the absence of a material adverse effect relating to AV Homes; and
 

 
•  the receipt by Taylor Morrison and AV Homes of a customary closing certificate on behalf of each respect party by an authorized officer

of each respective party.

For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger.”

No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals (See page 109)

The Merger Agreement precludes AV Homes from soliciting or engaging in discussions or negotiations with a third party with respect to any
proposal for a competing transaction, including the acquisition of a significant interest in AV Homes’ capital stock or assets. However, if, prior to
obtaining the requisite stockholder approval in connection with the Merger, AV Homes receives an unsolicited proposal from a third party for a
competing transaction that the AV Homes Board, among other things, determines in good faith (after consultation with AV Homes’ outside legal
counsel and financial advisor) (i) constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a proposal that is superior to the Merger, and (ii) did not
result from a breach of the non-solicitation obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement, then AV Homes may furnish non-public information to
and enter into discussions with that third party and its representatives and financing sources about such competing transaction after obtaining from
such third party an executed confidentiality agreement (subject to promptly and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours, notifying Taylor
Morrison of the status and material details thereof (including copies of any written documentation that is material to such unsolicited proposal)).
For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals.”

Termination of the Merger Agreement (See page 117)

The Merger Agreement may be terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time before the effective time of the Merger in the following
circumstances:
 

 •  by the mutual written consent of Taylor Morrison, Merger Sub and AV Homes;
 

 •  by either Taylor Morrison or AV Homes if:
 

 ○  the Merger is not consummated by the Outside Date;
 

 
○  any court of competent jurisdiction or governmental entity has issued a final and non-appealable judgment or order permanently

enjoining or otherwise permanently prohibiting the consummation of the Merger;

○  AV Homes stockholders fail to adopt the Merger Agreement at the AV Homes Special Meeting (or at any adjournment or

agreements, which breach or failure to perform (1) would give rise to the failure of any closing condition relating to the accuracy
of such other party’s representations and warranties or such other party’s compliance with covenants would fail to be satisfied,
and (2) such inaccuracy or breach is either incapable of being cured or is not cured within 45 days after receiving written notice
thereof;

recommendation to AV Homes stockholders to vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, in accordance with the terms and
provisions of the Merger Agreement; or

providing for a Superior Proposal, in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement.

For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement.”

Fees and Expenses and Termination Fees (See page 119)

Generally, each party is required to pay all fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with the Merger. However, the Merger Agreement
provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, AV Homes will be required to pay Taylor Morrison a cash
termination fee of $18,472,000 or $10,000,000, depending on the underlying facts.

For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—Fees and Expenses and Termination Fees.”

Listing of Shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock and Delisting and Deregistration of AV Homes Common Stock (See page 98)

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Taylor Morrison is required to use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Taylor Morrison
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, prior to the closing of the Merger. Accordingly,
application will be made to have such shares approved for listing on the NYSE, where shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock are currently
listed for trading under the ticker symbol “TMHC.”

If the Merger is completed, there will no longer be any publicly held shares of AV Homes Common Stock. Accordingly, AV Homes Common
Stock will no longer be listed on Nasdaq and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Comparison of Stockholder Rights (See page 140)

AV Homes stockholders will have different rights once they become Taylor Morrison stockholders due to differences between the
organizational documents of AV Homes and Taylor Morrison. See “Comparison of Stockholder Rights.”

Appraisal Rights (See page 146)

Pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, AV Homes stockholders who do not vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement, who
continuously hold their shares of AV Homes Common Stock through the effective time

Table of Contents

of the Merger and who otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL have the right to seek appraisal of the fair
value of their shares of AV Homes Common Stock, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, if the Merger is completed. The “fair value”
of shares of AV Homes Common Stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery could be greater than, the same as, or less than the value
of the Merger Consideration that AV Homes stockholders would otherwise be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement.

The right to seek appraisal will be lost if an AV Homes stockholder votes FOR adoption of the Merger Agreement. However, abstaining or
voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement is not in itself sufficient to perfect appraisal rights because additional actions must also be taken
to perfect such rights.

AV Homes stockholders who wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares must so advise AV Homes by submitting a written
demand for appraisal prior to the taking of the vote on the Merger Agreement at the AV Homes special meeting, and must otherwise follow the
procedures prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of AV Homes Common Stock held of record in
the name of another person, such as a nominee or intermediary, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps required by
Section 262 of the DGCL and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. In view of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, AV Homes
stockholders that may wish to pursue appraisal rights are urged to consult their legal and financial advisors. In addition, under Section 262 of the
DGCL, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who have perfected their appraisal rights
unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock, or (ii) the value of the
Merger Consideration provided in the Merger Agreement for the total number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock entitled to appraisal exceeds
$1 million. See “Appraisal Rights.”

Consideration, based on the closing prices of Taylor Morrison Common Stock of $22.04 on June 6, 2018 and $19.66 on August 24, 2018,
multiplied by 0.4034, the Mixed Consideration Stock Exchange Ratio.

The above table shows only historical comparisons. The market price of AV Homes Common Stock and Taylor Morrison Common Stock will
fluctuate prior to the AV Homes special meeting and before the consummation of the Merger, which will affect the implied value of the stock
portion of the Merger Consideration paid to the AV Homes stockholders. These comparisons may not provide meaningful information to AV
Homes stockholders in determining whether to adopt the Merger Agreement. AV Homes stockholders are urged to obtain current market quotations
for Taylor Morrison Common Stock and AV Homes Common Stock and to review carefully the other information contained in, or incorporated by
reference into, this proxy statement/prospectus in considering whether to adopt the Merger Agreement. See “Where You Can Find More
Information.”

In addition, AV Homes stockholders may not receive all consideration in the form they elect. See “Questions and Answers—What will AV
Homes stockholders receive in the Merger?”

RISK FACTORS

In deciding how and whether to vote, AV Homes stockholders should carefully consider the following risk factors and all of the information contained in
or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, including but not limited to, the matters addressed in the section entitled “Cautionary
Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” of this proxy statement/prospectus and the matters discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of
Taylor Morrison’s and AV Homes’ respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as updated from time to time in
Taylor Morrison’s and AV Homes’ respective subsequent filings with the SEC, which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.
See the section entitled “Where You Can Find More Information” of this proxy statement/prospectus.

Risk Factors Relating to the Merger

The Merger is subject to approval by the stockholders of AV Homes.

In order for the Merger to be completed, AV Homes stockholders must approve the Merger, which requires the affirmative vote of holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock entitled to vote thereon. There can be no assurance that this approval will be obtained.

Taylor Morrison’s stock price may be negatively impacted by risks, conditions and developments that apply to Taylor Morrison, which are different
from the risks, conditions and developments applicable to AV Homes.

Upon completion of the Merger, AV Homes stockholders who elect to receive the Stock Consideration or Mixed Consideration will become
holders of Taylor Morrison Common Stock and AV Homes stockholders who elect to receive Cash Consideration may become holders of Taylor
Morrison Common Stock. See “—AV Homes stockholders may not receive all consideration in the form they elect.” The businesses and markets of
Taylor Morrison are different from those of AV Homes. There is a risk that various factors, conditions and developments that would not affect the price
of AV Homes Common Stock could negatively affect the price of Taylor Morrison Common Stock.

AV Homes stockholders may not receive all consideration in the form they elect.

AV Homes stockholders that elect to receive the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration will be subject to proration if holders of AV
Homes Common Stock, in the aggregate, elect to receive more or less than the aggregate amount of cash consideration or Taylor Morrison Common
Stock to be paid in the Merger. Accordingly, AV stockholders who elect to receive the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration may instead
receive a combination of cash and shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock if necessary to maintain the aggregate mix of consideration described
above. The relative proportion of stock and cash that an AV Homes stockholder receives may also have a value that is higher or lower than the relative
proportion of stock and cash that the AV Homes stockholder elected to receive. A discussion of the proration mechanism can be found under the heading
“The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration.”

Taylor Morrison and AV Homes may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the Merger.

Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on Taylor Morrison and AV Homes employees may have an adverse effect on Taylor Morrison and AV
Homes and consequently the combined company. This uncertainty may impair Taylor Morrison’s and AV Homes’ ability to attract, retain and motivate
personnel both before and after completion of the Merger. Taylor Morrison and AV Homes are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of
their officers and other key employees to execute their business plans. The combined company’s success after the Merger will depend in part upon its
ability to retain key management personnel and other key employees of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes. Employee retention may be particularly
challenging during the pendency of the Merger, as employees may feel uncertain about their future roles with the combined company. In

Table of Contents

addition, Taylor Morrison and AV Homes may have to provide additional compensation in order to retain employees. If employees of Taylor Morrison
or AV Homes depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to become employees of the combined
company, the combined company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger could be reduced.

Taylor Morrison and AV Homes will incur significant transaction-related costs in connection with the Merger.

Taylor Morrison and AV Homes expect to incur a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with completing the Merger,
combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs will be significant. Non-recurring transaction
costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, filing fees and printing costs. Additional unanticipated costs
may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes. There can be no assurance that the elimination of certain
duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will offset the incremental transaction-
related costs over time. Thus, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, the long term or at all.

Failure to successfully combine the businesses of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes in the expected time frame may adversely affect the future results
of the combined company, and, consequently, the value of any Taylor Morrison Common Stock that AV stockholders receive as part of the Merger
Consideration.

The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on the ability of Taylor Morrison to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from combining
the businesses of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes. To realize these anticipated benefits, the businesses must be successfully combined. If the combined
company is not able to achieve these objectives, or is not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis, the anticipated benefits of the transactions
may not be realized fully or at all. In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, which could reduce the
anticipated benefits of the transactions. These integration difficulties could result in declines in the market value of Taylor Morrison Common Stock and,
consequently, result in declines in the market value of the Taylor Morrison Common Stock that AV Homes stockholders receive as part of the merger
consideration and continue to hold following consummation of the Merger.

The Merger is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied, and may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all.
Failure to complete the Merger could have material and adverse effects on AV Homes and Taylor Morrison.

The completion of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of the Merger by the AV Homes stockholders, which
make the completion and timing of the completion of the Merger uncertain. For more information relating to conditions to completion of the Merger, see
the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the Merger.” Also, either AV Homes or Taylor Morrison may terminate the
Merger Agreement if the Merger has not been completed by December 7, 2018, unless the failure of the Merger to be completed by such date has
resulted from the failure of the party seeking to terminate the Merger Agreement to perform its obligations.

If the Merger is not completed on a timely basis, or at all, Taylor Morrison’s and AV Homes’ respective ongoing businesses may be adversely
affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, Taylor Morrison and AV Homes will be subject to a number of risks,
including the following:
 

 
•  AV Homes may be required to pay Taylor Morrison a termination fee of approximately $18.5 million (or $10.0 million in certain

circumstances) if the Merger Agreement is terminated under qualifying circumstances, as described in the Merger Agreement;
 

 
•  AV Homes and Taylor Morrison will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed, such as

legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;

Table of Contents

 
•  under the Merger Agreement, each of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to

completing the Merger, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies;
 

 
•  time and resources committed by Taylor Morrison’s and AV Homes’ respective management to matters relating to the Merger could

otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities;
 

 
•  the market price of Taylor Morrison Common Stock or AV Homes Common Stock could decline below current market prices to the extent

that such current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed; and
 

 
•  if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the AV Homes Board seeks another business combination, stockholders of AV Homes cannot be

certain that AV Homes will be able to find a party willing to enter into a business combination or other strategic transaction on terms
equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that Taylor Morrison has agreed to in the Merger Agreement.

In addition, if the Merger is not completed, Taylor Morrison and/or AV Homes may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and
from their respective customers and employees. Taylor Morrison and/or AV Homes could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete
the Merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against Taylor Morrison or AV Homes to perform their respective obligations under the Merger
Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, Taylor Morrison and AV Homes cannot assure their respective stockholders that the risks described above
will not materialize and will not adversely affect the business, financial results and stock prices of Taylor Morrison and/or AV Homes.

The Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit AV Homes’ ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger, could discourage a potential
competing acquirer of AV Homes from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and, in specified circumstances, could require AV
Homes to pay a termination fee of up to approximately $18.5 million to Taylor Morrison.

Under the Merger Agreement, AV Homes is restricted from entering into an alternative transaction. Unless and until the Merger Agreement is
terminated, subject to specified exceptions (which are discussed in more detail in “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement”), AV
Homes is restricted from initiating, soliciting, knowingly facilitating or knowingly encouraging a competing acquisition proposal with any person.
Additionally, under the Merger Agreement, in the event of a potential change by the AV Homes Board of its recommendation with respect to the Merger
in light of a superior proposal, AV Homes must provide Taylor Morrison with three business days’ prior written notice to allow Taylor Morrison to
propose an adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. AV Homes may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an
agreement with respect to a superior proposal only if specified conditions have been satisfied, including compliance with the no solicitation and
termination provisions of the Merger Agreement. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a
significant part of AV Homes or Taylor Morrison from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to pay
consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the Merger, or might result in a
potential competing acquirer of AV Homes proposing to pay a lower price than it would otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense
of the termination fee that may become payable in specified circumstances.

Under the Merger Agreement, AV Homes may be required to pay to Taylor Morrison a termination fee of approximately $18.5 million if the
Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances. If such a termination fee is payable, the payment of this fee could have material and
adverse consequences to the financial condition and operations of AV Homes. For a discussion of the restrictions on AV Homes soliciting or entering
into an acquisition proposal or alternative transaction and the AV Homes Board’s ability to change its recommendation, see “The Merger Agreement—
No Solicitation of Alternative Proposals,” and “—Recommendation of the AV Homes Board of Directors.”

Table of Contents

AV Homes’ executive officers and directors have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of AV Homes’
stockholders generally.

Executive officers of AV Homes negotiated the terms of the Merger Agreement with their counterparts at Taylor Morrison, and the AV Homes
Board determined that entering into the Merger Agreement was advisable, fair to and in the best interests of AV Homes and its stockholders, and
approved, adopted, and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and recommended that AV Homes stockholders approve the Merger Agreement. In
considering these facts and the other information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus, you should be aware that aside from their interests as
stockholders, AV Homes’ executive officers and directors may have employment and other compensation arrangements or plans that give them financial
interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of AV Homes stockholders. For a further description of these interests
see the section entitled “The Merger—Interests of Certain AV Homes Directors and Officers in the Merger.”

The fairness opinions rendered to the AV Homes board by its financial advisors, J.P. Morgan and Moelis, were based on the financial analyses J.P.
Morgan and Moelis performed, which considered factors such as market and other conditions then in effect, and financial forecasts and other
information made available to them, as of the date of their opinions. As a result, these opinions do not reflect changes in events or circumstances
after the date of such opinions. AV Homes has not obtained, and does not expect to obtain, an updated fairness opinion from either of its financial
advisors reflecting changes in circumstances that may have occurred since the signing of the Merger Agreement.

The fairness opinion rendered to the AV Homes board by each of J.P. Morgan and Moelis was provided in connection with, and at the time of, the
AV Homes’ board’s evaluation of the Merger. These opinions were based on the financial analyses performed, which considered market and other
conditions then in effect, and financial forecasts and other information made available to J.P. Morgan and Moelis, respectively, as of the date of their
opinions, which may have changed, or may change, after the date of such opinions. AV Homes has not obtained updated opinions as of the date of proxy
statement/prospectus from its financial advisors. AV Homes does not expect to obtain updated opinions prior to completion of the Merger. Changes in
the operations and prospects of Taylor Morrison or AV Homes, general market and economic conditions and other factors which may be beyond the
control of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes, and on which the fairness opinions were based, may have altered the value of Taylor Morrison or AV Homes
or the prices of shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock or shares of AV Homes Common Stock since the dates of such opinions, or may alter such
values and prices by the time the Merger is completed. The opinion does not speak as of any date other than the date of such opinion. For a description
of the opinion that AV Homes received from its financial advisor, see the sections entitled “The Merger—Opinions of AV Homes’ Financial Advisors—
Opinion of AV Homes’ Financial Advisor, J.P. Morgan” and “The Merger—Opinions of AV Homes’ Financial Advisors—Opinion of AV Homes’
Financial Advisor, Moelis.”

The closing of the Merger may trigger change in control provisions in certain agreements to which AV Homes is a party.

Closing of the Merger may trigger change in control provisions in certain agreements to which AV Homes is a party, including the indentures
governing the AV Homes Convertible Notes and AV Homes 6.625% Notes. If AV Homes and Taylor Morrison are unable to negotiate waivers of those
provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary
damages. Even if AV Homes and Taylor Morrison are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waiver or seek to
renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to AV Homes or the combined company. While Taylor Morrison expects the closing of the Merger
will not trigger the change in control provisions in the indenture governing the AV Homes 6.625% Notes, there can be no assurance that this will be the
case. See “—Changes in credit rating could adversely affect the combined company, including by decreasing the combined company’s business
flexibility, financial condition and operating results, as well as the market price of Taylor Morrison Common Stock.”

AV Homes is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending, which could adversely affect AV Homes’
business and operations.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, AV Homes is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the
Merger, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to enter into contracts or
incur capital expenditures to grow its business. Such limitations could negatively affect AV Homes’ businesses and operations prior to the completion of
the Merger. Furthermore, the process of planning to integrate two businesses and organizations for the post-Merger period can divert management
attention and resources and could ultimately have an adverse effect on each of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes.

In connection with the Merger, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom AV Homes has a business relationship
may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with AV Homes as a result
of the Merger, which could negatively affect AV Homes revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of shares of its common stock,
regardless of whether the Merger is completed.

The exchange ratio is fixed and because the market price of Taylor Morrison Common Stock and AV Homes Common Stock will fluctuate, AV
Homes stockholders receiving Taylor Morrison Common Stock as part of the merger consideration cannot be sure of the market value of such
merger consideration relative to the value of their shares of AV Homes Common Stock that they are exchanging.

If the Merger is completed, each share of AV Homes Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive either $21.50 in cash (without any
interest thereon), 0.9793 shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock or $12.64 in cash (without any interest thereon) and 0.4034 shares of Taylor
Morrison Common Stock (subject to the adjustment and proration procedures described in further detail in the sections entitled “The Merger Agreement
—Merger Consideration” and “The Merger Agreement—Election and Exchange Procedures”). During the pendency of the Merger, the market value of
Taylor Morrison Common Stock will fluctuate, and decreases in the market value of Taylor Morrison Common Stock will negatively affect the value of
the merger consideration that AV Homes stockholders receive. The market value of AV Homes Common Stock will also fluctuate during the pendency
of the Merger, and increases in the market value of AV Homes Common Stock may mean that the merger consideration issued to AV Homes
stockholders will be worth less than the market value of the shares of AV Homes Common Stock such stockholders are exchanging. The exchange ratio
was fixed at the time the Merger Agreement was executed, and the value of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes stock may vary significantly from their
values on the date of the Merger Agreement, the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the date on which AV Homes stockholders vote on the Merger
Agreement, the date on which AV Homes stockholders make their election and the date on which AV Homes stockholders receive the merger
consideration. Neither AV Homes nor Taylor Morrison is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement solely due to changes in the market price of
either party’s common stock.

There will be a period of time between the date on which AV Homes stockholders make an election with respect to the form of merger
consideration to be received by them in exchange for their AV Homes Common Stock and the date on which AV Homes stockholders actually receive
Taylor Morrison Common Stock, depending on their election and subject to proration. Fluctuations in the market value of Taylor Morrison Common
Stock during this time period will also affect the value of the merger consideration, once it is actually received.

If an AV Homes stockholder elects to receive the Stock Consideration or the Mixed Consideration and the market value of Taylor Morrison
Common Stock falls between the time of the election and the time the merger consideration is actually received, the value of the merger consideration
received may be less than the value of the merger consideration such stockholder would have received if they had elected to receive the Cash
Consideration. Conversely, if an AV Homes stockholder elects to receive the Cash Consideration and the market

value of Taylor Morrison Common Stock rises between the time of the election and the time the merger consideration is actually received, the value of
the merger consideration received may be less than the value of the merger consideration such stockholder would have received if they had elected to
receive the Stock Consideration or the Mixed Consideration. AV Homes stockholders are urged to obtain current market quotations for Taylor Morrison
Common Stock when they make their elections.

The unaudited pro forma financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus may not necessarily reflect the combined company’s
operating results and financial condition following the Merger.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus is derived from Taylor
Morrison’s and AV Homes’ separate historical consolidated financial statements. The preparation of this pro forma information is based upon available
information and certain assumptions and estimates that Taylor Morrison and AV Homes currently believe are reasonable. These assumptions and
estimates may not prove to be accurate, and this pro forma financial information does not necessarily reflect what the combined company’s results of
operations and financial position would have been had the Merger been completed on the relevant dates assumed and the assumptions and estimates
were to prove accurate, or what the combined company’s results of operations or financial position will be in the future.

AV Homes’ financial estimates are based on various assumptions that may not prove to be correct.

The financial estimates set forth in the forecast included under “Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Unaudited Projected Financial
Information” are based on assumptions of, and information available to, AV Homes, at the time they were prepared and provided to the AV Homes
board and to J.P. Morgan and Moelis, as AV Homes’ financial advisors. AV Homes does not know whether the assumptions they made will prove
correct. Any or all of such estimates may turn out to be wrong. They can be adversely affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks
and uncertainties, many of which are beyond AV Homes’ control. Many factors mentioned in this proxy statement/prospectus and AV Homes’ other
filings with the SEC incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, including the risks outlined in this “Risk Factors” section and in AV
Homes’ public filings and the events and/or circumstances described under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” will be
important in determining AV Homes’ future results. See also, “Where You Can Find More Information.” As a result of these contingencies, actual future
results may vary materially from AV Homes’ estimates. In view of these uncertainties, the inclusion of AV Homes’ financial estimates in this proxy
statement/prospectus is not and should not be viewed as a representation that the forecasted results will be achieved. These financial estimates are AV
Homes’ internal financial forecasts and were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward compliance with published guidelines of any
regulatory or professional body. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and AV Homes undertakes no
obligation, other than as required by applicable law, to update its financial estimates herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date those
financial estimates were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. The financial estimates included in
this proxy statement/prospectus have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, AV Homes. Moreover, AV Homes’ independent accountants,
Deloitte & Touche LLP, have not compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to AV Homes’ prospective financial information
contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and, accordingly,
Deloitte & Touche LLP assumes no responsibility for, and disclaims any association with, AV Homes’ prospective financial information. The reports of
Deloitte & Touche LLP incorporated by reference relate exclusively to the historical financial information of the entities named in those reports and do
not cover any other information in this proxy statement/prospectus and should not be read to do so. See “Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement

Current Taylor Morrison stockholders and AV Homes stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in Taylor Morrison after the
Merger.

Upon the completion of the Merger, each AV Homes stockholder who receives consideration in the form of Taylor Morrison Common Stock and
each Taylor Morrison stockholder will have a percentage ownership of Taylor Morrison that is smaller than such stockholder’s previous percentage
ownership of AV Homes or Taylor Morrison, as applicable. Based on the number of issued and outstanding shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock
and AV Homes Common Stock on August 13, 2018, and assuming no adjustment in the number of shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock to be
issued as Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement and without giving effect to the issuance of any Merger Consideration to holders of
AV Homes Convertible Notes that are converted, AV Homes stockholders, as a group, will receive shares in the Merger constituting approximately 8%
of the Taylor Morrison Common Stock expected to be outstanding immediately after the Merger (not including any Taylor Morrison Common Stock
held by AV Homes stockholders prior to the merger), and Taylor Morrison stockholders, as a group, will own 92% of Taylor Morrison Common Stock
expected to be outstanding immediately after the Merger. As a result of these reduced ownership percentages, each of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes
stockholders, as a group, will have less voting power in, and influence on the board of directors, management and policies of, Taylor Morrison following
the Merger than they now have in their respective companies. If AV Homes Convertible Notes are converted prior to or in connection with or after the
Merger, the ownership and voting interest that current Taylor Morrison stockholders and AV Homes stockholders will have in Taylor Morrison after the
Merger may be further reduced. See “Treatment of the AV Homes Convertible Notes.”

Following the Merger, the AV Homes Convertible Notes will be convertible into the form of Merger Consideration elected by holders of a plurality of
the AV Homes Common Stock.

Following the Merger, the AV Homes Convertible Notes will be convertible into the Merger Consideration elected by holders of a plurality of the
AV Homes Common Stock in connection with the Merger. Although TPG has agreed to receive Stock Consideration pursuant to the Voting Agreement,
there can be no assurance that the AV Homes Convertible Notes will be convertible solely into Taylor Morrison Common Stock. If holders of a plurality
of the AV Homes Common Stock elect to receive all cash or mixed cash and stock consideration, then the AV Homes Convertible Notes will be
convertible in whole or in part into cash. The combined company expects to fund any required additional cash payments from additional borrowings
under its revolving credit facility.

Holders of the AV Homes Convertible Notes may also convert them at an increased conversion rate in connection with the Merger, and if such
conversion occurs with respect to all of the AV Homes Convertible Notes, such holders would be entitled to the Merger Consideration that would be
paid to holders of a total of approximately 4.4 million shares of AV Homes Common Stock. Such Merger Consideration would consist of (i) an
aggregate of approximately $95.0 million in cash if holders of a plurality of AV Homes Common Stock elect to receive all of the Merger Consideration
in cash, (ii) an aggregate of approximately 4.3 million shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock if holders of a plurality of such AV Homes Common
Stock elect to receive all of the Merger Consideration in Taylor Morrison Common Stock and (iii) an aggregate of approximately $55.8 million in cash
and approximately 1.8 million shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock if holders of a plurality of such AV Homes Common Stock elect to receive
mixed cash and stock consideration. The combined company expects to fund any required additional cash payments from additional borrowings under
its revolving credit facility.

The consideration deliverable upon conversion of AV Homes Convertible Notes as described in the preceding paragraph assumes that the Merger
closes on October 1, 2018 and the average closing price of the AV Homes Common Stock on the last five trading days preceding the closing date is
$21.50. Any AV Homes Convertible Notes that are not repurchased or converted will remain outstanding.

Potential litigation instituted against AV Homes, Taylor Morrison or their respective directors challenging the proposed Merger may prevent the
Merger from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all.

Potential litigation related to the Merger may result in injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the parties’
ability to complete the Merger. Such relief may prevent the Merger from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all. In addition,
defending against such claims may be expensive and divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the respective
businesses of AV Homes and Taylor Morrison.

Risk Factors Relating to the Combined Company Following the Merger

Although Taylor Morrison expects that its acquisition of AV Homes will result in cost savings, synergies and other benefits, the combined company
may not realize those benefits because of integration difficulties and other challenges.

The success of Taylor Morrison’s acquisition of AV Homes will depend in large part on the success of the management of the combined company
in integrating the operations, strategies, technologies and personnel of the two companies following the completion of the Merger. The combined
company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly
than expected. The failure of the combined company to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of the two companies or
to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the Merger, including additional cost savings and synergies, could impair the operations of the
combined company. In addition, Taylor Morrison anticipates that the overall integration of AV Homes will be a time-consuming and expensive process
that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt the combined company’s business.

Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following:
 

 •  the integration of management teams, strategies, technologies and operations, products and services;
 

 •  the disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of their respective management teams from ongoing business concerns;
 

 •  the retention of and possible decrease in business from the existing clients of both companies;
 

 •  the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;
 

 •  the reduction of the costs associated with each company’s operations;
 

 •  the integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale;
 

 •  the retention of key employees; and
 

 •  potential unknown liabilities associated with the Merger.

The anticipated cost savings, synergies and other benefits of the Merger assume a successful integration of the companies and are based on
projections and other assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Even if integration is successful, anticipated cost savings, synergies and other
benefits may not be achieved.

The market price of Taylor Morrison Common Stock may decline in the future as a result of the Merger.

The market price of Taylor Morrison Common Stock may decline in the future as a result of the Merger for a number of reasons, including:
 

 •  the unsuccessful integration of AV Homes and Taylor Morrison (including for the reasons set forth in the preceding risk factor);
 

 
•  the failure of the combined company to achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger, including financial results, as rapidly as or to the

extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts.

Table of Contents

These factors are, to some extent, beyond the control of Taylor Morrison. As a consequence, AV Homes stockholders who become holders of
Taylor Morrison Common Stock after completion of the Merger could lose the value of their investment in Taylor Morrison Common Stock.

The Merger may not be accretive and may cause dilution to the combined company’s earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market
price of the Taylor Morrison Common Stock.

Taylor Morrison currently anticipates that the Merger will be accretive to earnings per share (on an adjusted earnings basis) during the first full
calendar year after the Merger. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change. The combined company could also
encounter additional transaction-related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the Merger. All of these
factors could cause dilution to the combined company’s earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Merger and cause a
decrease in the market price of Taylor Morrison Common Stock.

The combined company’s future results will suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the Merger.

Following the Merger, the size of the business of the combined company will increase significantly beyond the current size of either Taylor
Morrison’s or AV Homes’ current businesses. The combined company’s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded
business, which may pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations
and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurance that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the
expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements and other benefits currently anticipated from the Merger.

Taylor Morrison and AV Homes face competition, which is expected to intensify and which may reduce the market share and profits of Taylor
Morrison after consummation of the Merger.

Competition in the homebuilding industry is intense, and there are relatively low barriers to entry in the industry. Homebuilders compete for,
among other things, home buying customers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. Increased competition could hurt Taylor
Morrison’s and AV Homes’ businesses, as it could prevent both companies from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such
acquisitions more expensive, hinder their market share expansion and lead to pricing pressures on their homes that may adversely impact their margins
and revenues. If the combined company is unable to successfully compete following the Merger, its business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition
and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Following the consummation of the Merger, the combined company’s competitive position could be weakened by strategic alliances or
consolidation within the homebuilding industry or the development of new technologies. The combined company’s ability to compete successfully will
depend on how well it markets its products and services and on its ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry,
including changes in consumer preferences or demographics, and changes in the product offerings or pricing strategies of the combined company’s
competitors.

After the consummation of the Merger, competition could materially adversely affect the combined company in several ways, including (i) the
loss of customers and market share, (ii) the combined company’s need to lower prices or increase marketing expenses to remain competitive and (iii) the
loss of business relationships within Taylor Morrison’s existing markets.

Taylor Morrison is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger and integration.

Taylor Morrison is expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with the Merger and the related integration. There are a large number of
processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that may need to be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance,
sales, payroll, pricing and benefits.

Table of Contents

While Taylor Morrison has assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred, there are many factors beyond its control that could affect the total
amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate
accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that Taylor Morrison expects to achieve from the elimination of
duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. These integration expenses likely will result in the combined company
taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the Merger, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.

Following the consummation of the Merger, Taylor Morrison will be bound by all of the obligations and liabilities of both companies.

Following the consummation of the Merger, the combined company will become bound by all of the obligations and liabilities of AV Homes in
addition to Taylor Morrison’s obligations and liabilities existing prior to the consummation of the Merger. Neither Taylor Morrison nor AV Homes can
predict the financial condition of the combined company at the time of the combination or the ability of the combined company to satisfy its obligations
and liabilities.

The Merger may result in a loss of suppliers and strategic alliances may result in the termination of existing contracts.

Following the Merger, some of the suppliers of Taylor Morrison or AV Homes, as historical businesses, may terminate or scale back their business
relationship with the combined company. Taylor Morrison and AV Homes have contracts with suppliers, vendors, and other business partners which
may require Taylor Morrison or AV Homes to obtain consents from these other parties in connection with the Merger, which may not be obtained at all
or on favorable terms. If supplier relationships or strategic alliances are adversely affected by the Merger, or if the combined company, following the
Merger, loses the benefits of the contracts of Taylor Morrison or AV Homes, the combined company’s business and financial performance could suffer.

Following the Merger, the combined company will have a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition
or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt-related obligations.

Following the Merger, the combined company will have a substantial amount of debt. As of June 30, 2018, on a pro forma basis, the combined
company would have had approximately $1.90 billion of outstanding debt (including under its outstanding debt securities and borrowings under its
revolving credit facilities). The combined company’s substantial debt could have important consequences for the holders of its common stock,
including:
 

 •  making it more difficult for the combined company to satisfy its obligations with respect to its debt or to its trade or other creditors;
 

 •  increasing the combined company’s vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;
 

 
•  limiting the combined company’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and land acquisitions, particularly when

the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited;
 

 
•  requiring the combined company to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on the combined company’s variable rate indebtedness if

interest rates rise;
 

 
•  requiring a substantial portion of the combined company’s cash flows from operations and the proceeds of any capital markets offerings or

loan borrowings for the payment of interest the combined company’s debt and reducing the combined company’s ability to use its cash flows
to fund working capital, capital expenditures, land acquisitions and general corporate requirements;

Table of Contents

 •  limiting the combined company’s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which it operates; and
 

 •  placing the combined company at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors.

The combined company may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, together with any future borrowings, to enable the combined
company to pay its indebtedness, or to fund the combined company’s other liquidity needs. The combined company may need to refinance all or a
portion of its indebtedness, on or before its maturity. The combined company may not be able to refinance any of its indebtedness on commercially
reasonable terms or at all. In addition, the combined company may incur additional indebtedness in order to finance its operations, to fund acquisitions,
or to repay existing indebtedness. If the combined company cannot service its indebtedness, it may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking
additional debt or equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Any such actions, if necessary,
may not be able to be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to the combined company’s
stockholders or on terms that would not require Taylor Morrison to breach the terms and conditions of its existing or future debt agreements.

Changes in credit rating could adversely affect the combined company, including by decreasing the combined company’s business
flexibility, financial condition and operating results, as well as the market price of Taylor Morrison Common Stock.

Downgrades in the combined company’s ratings could adversely affect the combined company’s businesses, cash flows, financial condition,
operating results and stock and debt prices.

Upon completion of the Merger, a subsidiary of Taylor Morrison will guarantee or assume the AV Homes 6.625% Notes (the “Qualified
Successor”). Provided that the Qualified Successor has an unsecured debt rating equal to or higher than Ba3 (or the equivalent) by Moody’s or equal to
or higher than BB- (or the equivalent) by S&P (a “Qualified Rating”) following the Merger, the restrictive covenants in the AV Homes 6.625% Notes
will be replaced by significantly less restrictive covenants, and it will not be necessary for the combined company to make a change of control offer for
the AV Homes 6.625% Notes.

While Taylor Morrison expects its subsidiaries to have a Qualified Rating upon the guarantee or assumption of the AV Homes 6.625% Notes,
there can be no assurance that this will be the case. If the Qualified Successor does not have a Qualified Rating upon the guarantee or assumption of the
AV Homes 6.625% Notes, there will be additional restrictions on the combined company’s operations, and the combined company will be required to
make an offer to purchase the AV Homes 6.625% Notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not
including the date of repurchase.

Other Risk Factors Relating to Taylor Morrison and AV Homes

As a result of entering into the Merger Agreement, Taylor Morrison’s and AV Homes’ businesses are and will be subject to the risks described
above. In addition, Taylor Morrison and AV Homes are, and following completion of the Merger, the combined company will continue to be, subject to
the risks described in Taylor Morrison’s and AV Homes’ respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, as
updated by subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, all of which are filed with the SEC and incorporated by

and does not provide the organization that holds its shares with specific voting instructions, then, under applicable rules, the organization that holds its
shares may generally vote on “routine” matters but cannot vote on “non-routine” matters. If the organizations that holds its shares does not receive
instructions from such AV Homes stockholder on how to vote its shares on a non-routine matter, that bank, broker, trust company or other nominee will
inform the inspector of election at the AV Homes special meeting that it does not have authority to vote on the matter with respect to such shares. This is
generally referred to as a “broker non-vote.” Abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock
represented at the AV Homes special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved. However, if a beneficial owner of AV
Homes Common Stock does not instruct its broker, bank, trust company or other nominee how to vote on any matter, the broker, bank, trust company or
other nominee will not have discretion to vote on any proposal at the AV Homes special meeting and such shares will not be deemed to be in attendance
at the meeting or counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved.

Required Vote

The required number of votes to approve the matters to be voted upon at the AV Homes special meeting depends on the particular item to be voted
upon as set out below:
 
   Item   Vote Necessary for Approval*
Proposal I

  

Adoption of the Merger Agreement

  

Approval requires the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of AV Homes
Common Stock, voting together as a single class.

Proposal II

  

Non-Binding Approval of Executive Pay

  

Approval requires the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of
holders of a majority of the votes which could be cast by the
holders of all classes of stock entitled to vote on such question
which are present in person or by proxy at the meeting.

Proposal III

  

Adjournment of AV Homes Special Meeting (if Necessary or
Appropriate)

  

Approval requires the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of
holders of a majority of the votes which could be cast by the
holders of all classes of stock entitled to vote on such question
which are present in person or by proxy at the meeting.

 
* Under the rules of Nasdaq, if you hold your shares of AV Homes Common Stock in street name, your nominee or intermediary may not vote your

shares without instructions from you. If you do not provide voting instructions on any Proposal, your shares will not be deemed in attendance at the
AV Homes special meeting and will not be voted. If you provide voting instructions on fewer than all three Proposals, a broker non-vote will occur
with respect to whichever Proposal(s) you did not provide voting instructions for. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the
applicable Proposal(s). Shares deemed not in attendance at the meeting, whether due to a record holder’s failure to vote in person or by proxy or a
“street name” holder’s failure to provide any voting instructions to such holder’s nominee or intermediary, and broker non-votes, will have the same
effect as a vote against Proposal I but will have no effect on Proposal II or Proposal III.

Share Ownership of and Voting by AV Homes Directors and Executive Officers

At the Record Date, AV Homes’ directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned and had the right to vote an aggregate of
1,254,014 shares of AV Homes Common Stock, which represents 5.6% of the voting power of the outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock
entitled to vote at the AV Homes special meeting.

It is expected that AV Homes’ directors and executive officers will vote their respective shares FOR the adoption of the Merger Agreement, FOR
the named executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal and FOR the approval of the adjournment proposal.

special meeting to determine whether they can do so.

PROPOSAL I: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

General

This proxy statement/prospectus is being provided to AV Homes stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies to be voted at the AV
Homes special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the AV Homes special meeting. At the AV Homes special meeting, AV Homes
will ask its stockholders to vote to (i) adopt the Merger Agreement (ii) approve (in a non-binding vote) certain executive compensation measures and
(iii) approve the adjournment proposal.

The Merger will not be completed without the adoption of the Merger Agreement by AV Homes stockholders. A copy of the Merger
Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to read the Merger Agreement in its entirety because it is the legal
document that governs the Merger. For additional information about the Merger Agreement, see “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page  100 of this
proxy statement/prospectus.

Effects of the Merger

At the effective time of the Merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into AV Homes. AV Homes will survive the Merger, and as a result of the
Merger, AV Homes, will be an indirect subsidiary of Taylor Morrison.

At the effective time of the Merger, AV Homes stockholders will be entitled to receive, at their election, consideration per share of AV Homes
Common Stock consisting of (i) $21.50 in cash, without interest (subject to the proration procedures described in this proxy statement/prospectus), (ii)
0.9793 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock (subject to the proration procedures described in this
proxy statement/prospectus) or (iii) a combination of $12.64 in cash, without interest, and 0.4034 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Taylor Morrison Common Stock (the Mixed Consideration, and, together with the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration, the “Merger
Consideration”). If no election is made as to a share of AV Homes Common Stock, the holder of that share will receive Mixed Consideration. The Cash
Consideration and Stock Consideration are subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement such that the aggregate Merger
Consideration will consist of approximately 58.8% cash and approximately 41.2% Taylor Morrison common stock, as further described in this proxy
statement/prospectus under the heading “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration.”

Background of the Merger

Members of senior management and the board of directors of AV Homes (the “AV Homes Board”) regularly review and consider AV Homes’
performance and operations, financial condition and the broader homebuilding industry in the context of AV Homes’ long-term strategic goals and
plans, with the goal of enhancing value for AV Homes’ stockholders. In connection with these activities, the AV Homes Board meets from time to time
in the ordinary course of business to consider and evaluate potential strategic alternatives, including business combinations, acquisitions, dispositions,
stock buybacks, secondary sales of stock in the public markets and other potential transactions, as well as various operational strategies available to AV
Homes.

During the fall of 2016, Roger Cregg, the Chief Executive Officer of AV Homes, was contacted by a representative of a foreign homebuilding
company, which we refer to as “Company A.” The representative from Company A and Mr. Cregg discussed the homebuilding industry generally, and
the performance of Company A and AV Homes, more particularly. During the course of this conversation, the representative of Company A indicated to
Mr. Cregg that Company A might have interest in a substantial investment in AV Homes. No particular terms or conditions of any such potential
transaction were discussed at that time.

On February 6, 2017, AV Homes entered into a customary confidentiality agreement with Company A, in order to permit Company A to conduct
preliminary discussions with respect to a potential transaction involving

Table of Contents

Company A and AV Homes. Over the course of February 2017 and the first half of March 2017, representatives of Company A and Mr. Cregg engaged
in high-level conversations with respect to a potential transaction between Company A and AV Homes.

On March 24, 2017, a representative of Company A sent AV Homes a non-binding preliminary indication of interest, which noted, among other
things, that subject to the completion of due diligence with respect to AV Homes and its business, and an agreement from AV Homes to negotiate
exclusively with Company A, Company A would be interested in acquiring up to 80% of the outstanding shares of the AV Homes Common Stock at a
price per share of between $19.00 and $21.00, which represented a premium of 18 % to 30% to the trading price of the AV Homes Common Stock on
the Nasdaq as of such date (the “Company A Proposal”).

On March 28, 2017, the AV Homes Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss the Company A Proposal. After reviewing and considering the
Company A Proposal, certain financial information and other materials, members of the AV Homes Board noted that certain assumptions underlying the
Company A Proposal were incorrect, discussed that the Company A Proposal did not appear to be credible in its current form and determined to provide
Company A with certain additional information with respect to AV Homes, so that Company A could correct its assumptions and revise its proposal.
Based on the foregoing considerations, the AV Homes Board concluded that, in its current form, the proposal was not acceptable and should be rejected.

Following the March 28, 2017 meeting of the AV Homes Board, members of AV Homes’ management provided limited diligence information to
representatives of Company A, in order to allow Company A to revise its proposal in the event that Company A determined to do so. A member of AV
Homes’ management also sent a revised draft non-disclosure agreement to Company A, including a standstill and non-solicitation provisions, which
provisions were offered as a condition to AV Homes offering any further due diligence information to Company A.

From time to time, Mr. Cregg accepts meetings with investment bankers who cover the homebuilding sector to discuss the current state of affairs
in the homebuilding industry, the companies participating in the industry and various strategic alternatives that may be available to AV Homes. One such
meeting occurred on March 30, 2017. At this meeting, the investment banker presented the strategic merit of a possible business combination between
AV Homes and Taylor Morrison (the “AV Homes / Taylor Morrison Presentation”). The investment banker also indicated to Mr. Cregg that the AV
Homes / Taylor Morrison Presentation had been made to Sheryl Palmer, the Chief Executive Officer of Taylor Morrison. During the meeting, Mr. Cregg
conveyed that, although AV Homes was not conducting a process with respect to any potential strategic transaction involving AV Homes, the AV Homes
Board and AV Homes’ management team regularly review and assess AV Homes’ strategic direction, and would review the materials.

On April 5, 2017, the AV Homes Board held its regularly scheduled meeting. Among other things, during this meeting, representatives of J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC, which we refer to as “J.P. Morgan,” and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., which we refer to as “Citi,” each presented an
overview of the mergers and acquisitions environment for the homebuilding sector, their perspectives on the position of AV Homes within the
homebuilding market and strategic alternatives for AV Homes to consider, including with respect to potential transaction counterparties. These
presentations were based on publicly available information regarding the homebuilding sector and AV Homes. Neither J.P. Morgan nor Citi was engaged
by AV Homes or the AV Homes Board in connection with this meeting, and neither received any fees in connection therewith. Following their
presentations, the representatives of J.P. Morgan and Citi left the meeting. During the remainder of this meeting, the AV Homes Board discussed the
request from Company A to commence due diligence, and AV Homes’ request for a standstill agreement in exchange for more complete diligence
materials, which request remained unanswered at the time of this meeting. After further discussion, the AV Homes Board determined that no further
confidential information with respect to AV Homes should be provided to Company A and that management should terminate discussions with
Company A, and instead focus on operating AV Homes’ business.

As a result of the AV Homes / Taylor Morrison Presentation, on April 12, 2017, Ms. Palmer called Mr. Cregg, to communicate Taylor Morrison’s
potential interest in a business combination and arranged a breakfast meeting.

On April 21, 2017, Ms. Palmer and Mr. Cregg met for breakfast to discuss the March 30 banker presentation, including the status of the
homebuilding industry generally and the possibility of an acquisition of AV Homes by Taylor Morrison. During the meeting, Ms. Palmer referred to the
March 30 presentation and indicated that, subject to further discussion internally at Taylor Morrison, including among the board of directors of Taylor
Morrison (the “Taylor Morrison Board”), Taylor Morrison might be interested in discussing the possibility of such a transaction Mr. Cregg and
Ms. Palmer did not discuss during this meeting the price at which either party might be interested in transacting or any other particular terms of any
potential transaction between the two companies.

On September 13, 2017, Joshua Nash, the Chairman of the AV Homes Board, Matthew Coleman, a partner and chief operating officer of the TPG
real estate platform and a member of the AV Homes Board (nominated for election by TPG Aviator, L.P., which, together with its affiliates, we refer to
as “TPG,” AV Homes’ largest stockholder) and Mr. Cregg met in New York City. During this meeting, Mr. Nash, Mr. Coleman and Mr. Cregg discussed
the homebuilding industry, including current trends, market positioning and competitors. They also discussed TPG’s investment in AV Homes and that
TPG would be supportive of a potential sale of AV Homes that could result in TPG disposing of its equity position in AV Homes if the AV Homes Board
determined that pursuing such a transaction would be in the best interests of AV Homes and its shareholders. Following this meeting, Mr. Nash
requested that Mr. Cregg begin the process of selecting one or more investment banks to assist AV Homes and the AV Homes Board in evaluating the
advisability of a potential strategic transaction involving AV Homes.

On September 26, 2017, Mr. Cregg received a telephone call from a representative of Moelis & Company LLC, which we refer to as “Moelis,”
during which the representative of Moelis told Mr. Cregg that two different homebuilding companies, which we refer to as Company B and Company C,
had independently contacted Moelis to express preliminary interest in acquiring AV Homes. In response to this information, Mr. Cregg agreed for the
representative of Moelis to arrange meetings with a representative of each of Company B and Company C.

On October 11, 2017, Mr. Nash, Mr. Cregg, Mr. Coleman, Michael Profenius, a member of the AV Homes Board, and a representative of Moelis
met in New York City. During this meeting, Mr. Nash, Mr. Cregg, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Profenius and the Moelis representative discussed the
homebuilding industry, including current trends, market positioning, competitors and the environment for mergers and acquisitions.

On October 18, 2017, Mr. Cregg met for dinner with the representative of Moelis and a representative from Company B. During this meeting,
Mr. Cregg and the representative of Company B discussed industry developments, each company’s business and a potential business combination
between AV Homes and Company B, although no specific terms of any possible transaction were discussed. Following this meeting, the representative
of Company B informed the representative of Moelis that Company B had determined that it was no longer interested in exploring a potential
acquisition of AV Homes.    

On October 31, 2017, Mr. Cregg and Ms. Palmer held a meeting during which Mr. Cregg and Ms. Palmer again discussed the potential for an
acquisition of AV Homes by Taylor Morrison. In particular, Mr. Cregg and Ms. Palmer discussed the similarities between the two companies, their
mutual respect for the business of the other company and their general sense that a transaction between the two companies might be strategically
advantageous to both companies. During this meeting, Mr. Cregg and Ms. Palmer discussed in general terms that a potential transaction should be
structured as an acquisition of AV Homes by Taylor Morrison, but price was not discussed.

On November 2, 2017, Mr. Cregg, a representative of Moelis and the Chief Executive Officer of Company C held a meeting during which they
discussed industry developments, each company’s business and the possibility of an acquisition of AV Homes by Company C.

On November 13, 2017, Mr. Cregg received a telephone call from the Chief Executive Officer of a U.S.-based homebuilding company, which we
refer to as “Company D,” suggesting to meet for dinner to discuss the industry dynamics and to explore the possibility of a business combination. In
response to this request, Mr. Cregg agreed to meet.

On November 27, 2017, Mr. Cregg met with the Chief Executive Officer of Company D. During this meeting, Mr. Cregg and the Chief Executive
Officer of Company D discussed industry developments, including current trends, market positioning and other participants in the industry. They also
discussed a potential business combination between AV Homes and Company D, although no specific terms of a possible transaction were discussed.
During the meeting, Mr. Cregg conveyed that, although AV Homes was not conducting a process with respect to any potential strategic transaction
involving AV Homes, the AV Homes Board and AV Homes’ management team regularly review and assess AV Homes’ strategic direction. The chief
executive officer of Company D indicated that Company D had significant interest in a potential combination and that Company D was working with
investment bankers.

During the month of November 2017, in light of TPG’s investment in AV Homes and TPG’s investment in Taylor Morrison, at the direction of
Mr. Nash and Mr. Cregg, representatives of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, counsel to AV Homes, which we refer to as “Wachtell Lipton,” engaged in
discussions with representatives of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, counsel to TPG, which we refer to as “Kirkland,” regarding the possibility of forming a
special committee of the AV Homes Board, which committee would consist only of members of the AV Homes Board that were not affiliated with TPG.
During this period, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and Kirkland exchanged drafts of a unanimous written consent of the members of the AV Homes
Board that would authorize the creation of such a committee.

On December 6, 2017, the AV Homes Board conducted a regularly scheduled meeting. At that meeting, among other things, the AV Homes Board
met in executive session and discussed generally potential strategic alternatives for AV Homes and whether, in light of TPG’s investment in AV Homes
and TPG’s investment in Taylor Morrison, it would be advisable to form a special committee.

On December 8, 2017, Mr. Cregg received a non-binding proposal letter from Company D. The non-binding proposal letter contemplated an
all-stock business combination transaction in which Company D would acquire AV Homes, with the fully diluted stockholders of AV Homes (including,
for purposes of Company D’s proposal, equity issuable upon conversion of the AV Homes outstanding convertible notes) receiving consideration
representing less than 50% of the combined company (the “December 8 Proposal”). The December 8 Proposal represented a 9% premium to the price of
AV Homes Common Stock based on Company D’s and AV Homes’ respective closing stock prices as of December 8, 2017.

On December 12, 2017, in light of the conditions in the homebuilding market and in view of AV Homes having received the third-party
expressions of interest described above with respect to a possible strategic transaction with AV Homes, the AV Homes Board determined to form a
special committee, which we refer to as the Special Committee, consisting of Mr. Nash (as chairman), Paul D. Barnett, Jonathan M. Pertchik, Roger W.
Einiger, Michael F. Profenius and Joel M. Simon, each of whom is an independent member of the AV Homes Board. The AV Homes Board authorized
the Special Committee to review the advisability of a potential strategic transaction involving AV Homes and to oversee and direct the process for
considering, evaluating and negotiating any such transaction, as well as other matters appurtenant thereto. The Special Committee was also instructed to
review on a continuing basis the likelihood of an actual or perceived conflict of interest on the part of the TPG nominees to the AV Homes Board, and in
light of such review, to determine whether or not the Special Committee remained necessary in the future.

On December 14, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting to discuss its mandate and to review and consider the December 8
Proposal. To support and advise the Special Committee in this review, and in the evaluation of the advisability of a potential strategic transaction
involving AV Homes more generally, the Special Committee determined to evaluate investment bankers for a possible engagement, and to invite several
investment bankers with experience in the homebuilding sector to present their qualifications to the Special Committee at its next meeting.

On December 19, 2017, the Special Committee held an in-person meeting with representatives from AV Homes management and a representative
of Wachtell Lipton to evaluate prospective investment bankers. During this meeting, representatives of J.P. Morgan, Moelis and Citi presented their
qualifications and experience generally. Following review and discussion, including consideration of the qualifications, reputation and experience of the
various investment banks (and their respective representatives), the Special Committee determined to engage both Moelis and J.P. Morgan as its
financial advisors in connection with AV Homes’ review of its strategic alternatives.

Both J.P. Morgan and Moelis subsequently entered into engagement letters with AV Homes to formalize their engagement as financial advisors to
AV Homes. Citi subsequently entered into an engagement with Taylor Morrison to serve as Taylor Morrison’s financial advisor.

On December 26, 2017, Ms. Palmer called Mr. Cregg to inform him that Taylor Morrison remained interested in a potential business combination
and that Ms. Palmer intended to send a draft confidentiality agreement to facilitate conversations and due diligence between AV Homes and Taylor
Morrison. On December 27, 2017, Ms. Palmer emailed Mr. Cregg a draft confidentiality agreement and preliminary due diligence request list. Mr. Cregg
acknowledged Ms. Palmer’s request to negotiate a confidentiality agreement and commence due diligence with respect to a potential transaction, but
declined to do so at that time.

On January 10, 2018, at the direction of the Special Committee, a representative of Moelis informed Company C that AV Homes would be willing
to explore the possibility of an acquisition by Company C, and proposed that Company C enter into a confidentiality agreement with customary terms
including standstill with AV Homes to permit due diligence and potential discussions between the parties.

On January 11, 2018, the Special Committee met to receive an update from representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis on recent inbound inquiries
about AV Homes and next steps. During this meeting, AV Homes’ financial advisors offered their view that further engaging with Company C could
present the possibility of an offer to acquire AV Homes at an attractive valuation of the AV Homes Common Stock. Based on this advice and the other
considerations reviewed by the AV Homes Board during this meeting, including the view of the AV Homes Board that Company C was likely to require
a lengthy diligence process, the AV Homes Board determined to seek to discuss the possibility of a strategic transaction with Company C before
determining whether to conduct a process involving other potential counterparties.

On January 16, 2018, Company C entered into a customary mutual confidentiality agreement with AV Homes, which included a customary
standstill provision.

On January 17, 2018, pursuant to an offering that Taylor Morrison publicly disclosed in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 17, 2018, TPG
completed a disposition of all of its equity interest in Taylor Morrison and TPG’s designees to the board of directors of Taylor Morrison resigned from
the Taylor Morrison board of directors, effective as of such date.

On January 17, 2018, the Chief Executive Officer of a U.S. homebuilding company, which we refer to as Company E, contacted Mr. Cregg to
express interest in participating in any potential strategic process with respect to AV Homes. Mr. Cregg informed the representative of Company E that
AV Homes was not presently conducting a sale process.

On January 19, 2018, the Special Committee, after consulting with Wachtell Lipton and AV Homes’ financial advisors, determined that, in light of
TPG’s disposition of its entire interest in Taylor Morrison and the resignation of the TPG designees to the Taylor Morrison Board, no actual or perceived
conflict of interest continued to exist with respect to the TPG nominees on the AV Homes Board. As a result, and in consideration of the benefits to AV
Homes of the expertise of TPG’s nominees on the AV Homes Board and TPG’s perspective as a significant shareholder of AV Homes, the Special
Committee was dissolved and transferred its responsibilities to the AV Homes Board.

On the same day, Mr. Cregg and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis met with the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and
other representatives of Company C, during which they discussed the homebuilding industry, the AV Homes business, the AV Homes Management
Forecasts and the possibility of an acquisition of AV Homes by Company C.

The AV Homes Board met as regularly scheduled on January 30, 2018, with representatives from AV Homes management, J.P. Morgan, Moelis
and Wachtell Lipton in attendance. Among other business conducted at the meeting, Mr. Nash asked representatives from J.P. Morgan and Moelis to
provide an update on the latest developments relating to the ongoing strategic discussions. Following a presentation from J.P. Morgan and Moelis, the
AV Homes Board reviewed and discussed the December 8 Proposal, and received an update with respect to prior contacts with Ms. Palmer and
representatives of Taylor Morrison, as well as other possible third parties with whom AV Homes could engage. The AV Homes Board determined that
the December 8 Proposal did not present a compelling value for AV Homes and instructed Mr. Cregg to communicate to Company D that AV Homes
was not interested in proceeding with Company D at that time. The AV Homes Board also determined to wait for Company C to proceed with its
internal evaluation in order to make a complete proposal, which, based on prior interactions with Company C, the AV Homes Board believed could be
ready by mid-February.

On February 2, 2018, at the direction of AV Homes, a representative of Moelis met with the Chief Financial Officer of Company C to discuss
Company C’s due diligence requests and the due diligence process. On February 5, 2018, the AV Homes’ financial advisors provided Company C with
certain requested financial analysis with respect to AV Homes, including an analysis of AV Homes’ management plan and a synergies analysis to assist
Company C in quantifying sources of incremental value, both of which were approved by AV Homes management.

Also on February 5, 2018, Mr. Cregg informed the Chief Executive Officer of Company D that the AV Homes Board had determined not to move
forward with a strategic transaction with Company D based on the December 8 Proposal.

On February 16, 2018, Mr. Cregg received a non-binding indication of interest from Taylor Morrison (the “February 16 Proposal”), which
proposed an acquisition of AV Homes by Taylor Morrison, in which AV Homes stockholders would receive a mix of cash and Taylor Morrison Common
Stock valued at $20.25 per share of AV Homes Common Stock. The February 16 Proposal represented a 19% premium to the preceding one-month
volume weighted average price of the AV Homes Common Stock on the Nasdaq. Ms. Palmer further indicated to Mr. Cregg, in a conversation, that
Taylor Morrison intended the mix of consideration in the proposed transaction to be approximately 50% cash and 50% stock, but that there may be some
flexibility in the mix of consideration.

Also on February 16, 2018, at the direction of the AV Homes Board, a representative of Moelis spoke to a representative of Company C and was
informed that Company C would be unable to submit a formal proposal to AV Homes for at least another 30 days.

On February 21, 2018, the AV Homes Board held a telephonic meeting, with the participation of representatives of AV Homes management, J.P.
Morgan, Moelis and Wachtell Lipton. The purpose of the meeting was to receive a presentation and update from J.P. Morgan and Moelis regarding their
work on the

possible strategic alternatives, discuss the February 16 Proposal and to allow the AV Homes Board to decide what, if any, next steps should be taken.
During the meeting, the representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis updated the AV Homes Board on their respective work regarding AV Homes’
strategic alternatives and the ongoing discussions with third parties. After delivering presentations and responding to follow-up questions from the
members of the AV Homes Board, the representatives from J.P. Morgan and Moelis left the call. During the remainder of the call, the AV Homes Board
discussed the potential counterparties, including why certain counterparties may be more disposed to a transaction on potentially more favorable terms
to AV Homes. Based on this discussion, the AV Homes Board determined that the price reflected in the February 16 Proposal was not compelling at this
time, and instructed management and representatives of AV Homes’ financial advisors to communicate the message to Taylor Morrison. The AV Homes
Board also determined that it was not interested in actively assessing the interest of other potential counterparties at such time, and that it would
reconsider the situation at a future meeting, depending on how circumstances evolved, in particular with respect to Company C.

On February 22, 2018, Mr. Cregg communicated to Ms. Palmer that the AV Homes Board did not find the February 16 Proposal sufficiently
compelling to authorize AV Homes’ management to engage in discussions. As follow up, the representatives of Taylor Morrison inquired about the
possibility of receiving additional information about AV Homes in order to improve Taylor Morrison’s proposal.

On February 23, 2018, Mr. Cregg had lunch with a senior executive of a U.S. homebuilding company, which we refer to as “Company F.” During
this meeting, the representative of Company F and Mr. Cregg discussed the homebuilding industry and the recent corporate history of AV Homes. The
representative from Company F also indicated a strong interest in exploring a potential acquisition of AV Homes by Company F. In response, Mr. Cregg
noted that AV Homes was not for sale, but that Company F could submit a transaction proposal if it so desired.

On February 28, 2018, AV Homes received a non-binding indication of interest from Company F, which provided that Company F would acquire
AV Homes in an all-cash transaction at a premium of 30% to 40% to AV Homes’ 30-day volume weighted average stock price of $16.64, implying a
share price of $21.63 to $23.30 (the “February 28 Proposal”). The February 28 Proposal also requested that AV Homes enter into a 45-day exclusivity
agreement under which AV Homes would be restricted from engaging with other parties or participating in another sale process while Company F
completed its due diligence and negotiated definitive transaction documentation. The February 28 Proposal was subject to completion of due diligence,
TPG’s entry into a voting agreement and other conditions.

Also on February 28, 2018, at the direction of the AV Homes Board, a representative of J.P. Morgan met with Ms. Palmer, who reaffirmed Taylor
Morrison’s interest in AV Homes and requested access to due diligence information to improve its proposal.

On March 2, 2018, the Finance Committee of the AV Homes Board (the “Finance Committee”) held a telephonic meeting, with representatives
from AV Homes management, Wachtell Lipton, J.P. Morgan and Moelis. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the February 28 Proposal from
Company F and to discuss a potential targeted sale process with respect to AV Homes, given the coalescence of recent interest in AV Homes from
potential counterparties. J.P. Morgan and Moelis advised that a targeted process, rather than a broad one, had the advantages of providing useful
indications about what value third parties might ascribe to AV Homes, while mitigating risks that a process could harm AV Homes by taking up
management time and attention or general distraction to the business. J.P. Morgan and Moelis advised that were AV Homes to commence a targeted sale
process, it would be appropriate for the Company to explore interest from other potential counterparties, in particular as it seemed unlikely that
Company C would submit a proposal in a timely manner. With the assistance of J.P. Morgan and Moelis, the AV Homes Board reviewed which potential
counterparties would be a strategic fit for the Company and would be realistic participants in a targeted sale process. The Finance Committee
determined, and instructed J.P. Morgan and Moelis, that it would like the financial advisors to run a targeted sale process, which would include
Company C, Taylor Morrison, Company E, Company F and a U.S. homebuilding company that we refer to as “Company G.”

On March 7, 2018, AV Homes entered into a customary confidentiality agreement with Taylor Morrison, which included a standstill provision,
and, on March 8, 2018, AV Homes entered into a customary confidentiality agreement with Company F, which included a customary standstill
provision. On March 9, 2018, AV Homes entered into a customary confidentiality agreement with Company G, which included a customary standstill
provision. Also during March 2018, Company E declined to execute a confidentiality agreement.

Between March 12, 2018 and March 19, 2018, members of the AV Homes management team and representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis
participated in separate presentations with respect to AV Homes and its business with representatives of Taylor Morrison, representatives of Company F
and representatives of Company G. These management presentations addressed AV Homes’ business and prospects, AV Homes’ management’s business
plan and the assumptions underlying that plan, and other matters customary in business diligence.

Following the management presentations, at the direction of the AV Homes Board, J.P Morgan and Moelis requested that each of Taylor Morrison,
Company F and Company G provide updated proposals during the week of March 26, 2018. As such, between March 12, 2018 and March 26, 2018, the
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis received and addressed follow-up due diligence requests from Taylor Morrison, Company F and Company G.
Such requested information generally consisted of forward-looking projections, including community-level operating and margin data, selling, general
and administrative expense detail, additional balance sheet information, non-core assets detail and appraisals and corporate-level employment and
operating agreements.

On March 29, 2018, AV Homes received an updated non-binding indication of interest from Taylor Morrison, which proposed an acquisition of
AV Homes by Taylor Morrison, in which Taylor Morrison would acquire all of the outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock for $22.00 per
share, payable in a mix of cash and Taylor Morrison Common Stock (the “March 29 Proposal”). The offer represented a 19% premium to the closing
price of AV Homes Common Stock on the Nasdaq on March 29, 2018. The March 29 Proposal was subject to completion of customary due diligence,
Taylor Morrison Board approval and negotiation of mutually acceptable definitive transaction documents that contained customary terms and
conditions.

On March 30, 2018, AV Homes received an updated non-binding indication of interest from Company F, which proposed a business combination
in which Company F would acquire all of the outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock for $22.00 per share, payable in cash (the “March 30
Proposal”). The March 30 Proposal represented a 19% premium to the closing price of AV Homes Common Stock on the Nasdaq on March 29, 2018.
The March 30 Proposal was subject to completion of due diligence, TPG’s entry into a voting agreement and entry by AV Homes into a 30-day
exclusivity agreement pursuant to which AV Homes could not participate in discussions with any other third parties. In addition, in a discussion among
representatives of J.P. Morgan, Moelis and representatives of Company F’s financial advisor to clarify certain aspects of Company F’s proposal,
representatives of Company F’s financial advisor noted that Company F would be unwilling to proceed with due diligence and further evaluation of a
transaction without entering into an exclusivity agreement.

Also on March 30, 2018, representatives of Company G informed a representative of Moelis that Company G declined to submit a proposal.

On April 4, 2018, the AV Homes Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from AV Homes management, J.P. Morgan, Moelis and
Wachtell Lipton in attendance. During this meeting, the AV Homes Board received an update from J.P. Morgan and Moelis regarding AV Homes’
strategic alternatives and ongoing communications with Taylor Morrison and Company F, as well as feedback received from other potential
counterparties that were no longer participating in the targeted sale process. The AV Homes Board also received an update about AV Homes’ current
performance and the performance of the U.S. homebuilding market. The AV Homes Board reviewed and discussed the March 29 Proposal from Taylor
Morrison and the March 30 Proposal from Company F, including the fact that the stock component of Taylor Morrison’s proposal could provide

upside to the March 29 Proposal and the fact the Company F continued to insist on a period of contractual exclusivity before engaging in a detailed due
diligence investigation. After discussions between the members of the AV Homes Board and with AV Homes management and advisors, the AV Homes
Board instructed representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis to communicate to Taylor Morrison and Company F that each potential counterparty would
be given access to additional due diligence information in order to improve their proposals.

On April 5, 2018, at the direction of the AV Homes Board, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis separately contacted representatives of the
financial advisor to Company F and representatives of Citi, the financial advisor to Taylor Morrison, to convey the view of AV Homes Board that each
potential counterparty should seek to increase the value of its proposal, and provide updated proposals by April 13, 2018. The representatives of J.P.
Morgan and Moelis communicated to Citi and the financial advisor to Company F that additional due diligence information would be provided in order
to support improved proposals, and that each bidder should submit any additional supplemental due diligence requests.

Between April 6, 2018 and April 12, 2018, representatives from AV Homes management, J.P. Morgan and Moelis provided representatives from
each of Taylor Morrison and Company F access to additional due diligence information. Each of Taylor Morrison and Company F provided
supplemental due diligence information request lists, which were primarily focused on first quarter performance, the Dallas market operations and
ongoing litigation with respect to certain of AV Homes’ assets. AV Homes provided additional information through its electronic data room and
participated in a number of due diligence calls with each of Taylor Morrison and Company F.

On April 13, 2018, AV Homes received an updated non-binding indication of interest from Taylor Morrison, which proposed an acquisition of AV
Homes by Taylor Morrison, in which Taylor Morrison would acquire all outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock for $22.50 per share assuming
an approximately equal mix of cash and Taylor Morrison Common Stock (the exact mix to be determined at a later date), representing a $0.50 per share
increase in value from the March 29 Proposal (the “April 13 Proposal”). The April 13 Proposal represented a premium of 16% to the closing price of AV
Homes Common Stock on the Nasdaq on April 13, 2018 and remained subject to customary completion conditions.

Later on April 13, 2018, representatives from J.P. Morgan and Moelis contacted a representative of the financial advisor to Company F, to inquire
about the status of Company F’s revised proposal and to note that the failure to observe process deadlines would be taken into consideration by the AV
Homes Board in evaluating the proposals of potential counterparties. The representative of Company F’s financial advisor informed J.P. Morgan and
Moelis that Company F would be unable to submit its revised written proposal before April 15, 2018.

On April 15, 2018, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis had a telephone call with representatives of the financial advisor to Company F,
during which the financial advisor to Company F verbally indicated that Company F had updated its proposed purchase price to an all-cash offer of
$22.75 per share of AV Homes Common Stock.

On April 16, 2018, a representative of Citi provided to representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis a supplementary due diligence request list for
confirmatory due diligence.

On April 17, 2018, Company F submitted an updated written non-binding indication of interest, which proposed a business combination in which
Company F would acquire all of the outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock for $22.75 per share, payable in cash (the “April 17 Proposal”).
The April 17 Proposal represented a 15% premium to the closing price of AV Homes Common Stock on the Nasdaq on April 17, 2018. The April 17
Proposal was subject to completion of due diligence, TPG’s entry into a voting agreement and entry by AV Homes into a 30-day exclusivity agreement
pursuant to which AV Homes could not participate in discussions with any other potential counterparties.

On April 17, 2018, the AV Homes Board held a telephonic meeting, with the participation of representatives from AV Homes management, J.P.
Morgan, Moelis and Wachtell Lipton. The AV Homes Board discussed the April 13 Proposal from Taylor Morrison and the April 17 Proposal from
Company F, including the fact that the stock component of Taylor Morrison’s proposal continued to provide the possibility of upside to Taylor
Morrison’s April 13 Proposal and the fact the Company F continued to request contractual exclusivity. Given the relative lack of differentiation in the
headline financial terms of the bids, the AV Homes Board instructed the Company’s advisors to provide both potential counterparties with a term sheet
describing key proposed terms with respect to a potential acquisition of AV Homes, including that AV Homes would be permitted to terminate the
merger agreement to accept a superior proposal, subject to customary procedural restrictions, that the termination fee payable by AV Homes would be
equal to 2.75% of the equity valuation of AV Homes in the transaction, that TPG’s voting agreement would terminate upon a change in recommendation
by the AV Homes Board and that the targeted announcement date for the potential transaction would be May 14, 2018. The AV Homes Board also
instructed its financial advisors to request that both potential counterparties improve the financial terms of their proposals.

On April 18, 2018, a representative of Moelis sent a proposed term sheet to the financial advisor to Company F and, on April 19, 2018, a
representative of J.P. Morgan sent a proposed term sheet to representatives of Citi. Both Company F and Taylor Morrison were asked to respond to the
term sheets by April 20, 2018. The representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis informed both potential counterparties that “best and final” proposals were
due the afternoon of April 20, 2018.

On April 20, a financial advisor to Company F informed Moelis that Company F would not be able to respond to the term sheet by April 20, 2018.

On April 20, 2018, Ms. Palmer delivered to Mr. Cregg an updated non-binding indication of interest from Taylor Morrison, which included a
markup of the term sheet and provided for a business combination in which Taylor Morrison would acquire all outstanding shares of AV Homes for
$23.00 per share, of which 70% would be comprised of cash and the remaining 30% comprised of Taylor Morrison Common Stock (the “April 20
Proposal”). The April 20 Proposal also indicated that Taylor Morrison was prepared to quickly complete its due diligence and sign definitive agreements
by May 14, 2018. Taylor Morrison’s mark-up of the term sheet provided for contractual exclusivity through May 14, proposed to prevent AV Homes
from terminating the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal (a so-called “force the vote” provision), proposed to prevent TPG from terminating
the voting agreement in the event of a change in recommendation by the AV Homes Board, proposed to increase the termination fee to 4.0% of the
equity valuation of AV Homes in the transaction and provided for expense reimbursement in the event that AV Homes’ stockholders voted down the
transaction without a change in the recommendation of the AV Homes Board (a so-called “naked no vote” fee).

On April 22, 2018, representatives of J.P. Morgan, Moelis and Wachtell Lipton, had a call with representatives of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &
Garrison LLP, which we refer to as “Paul, Weiss,” legal counsel to Taylor Morrison, and representatives of Citi. During this call AV Homes’ advisors
delivered feedback on the term sheet which comprised part of the April 20 Proposal, including the view of AV Homes’ advisory team that, although AV
Homes would be willing to work with Taylor Morrison to agree on a mutually acceptable termination fee, AV Homes would not be willing to accept a
deal structure that would result in locking up the potential transaction. AV Homes’ advisors encouraged Taylor Morrison’s advisors to revise their bid to
include provisions that more closely reflected the deal structure set forth in AV Homes draft term sheet.

On April 23, 2018, Ms. Palmer emailed Mr. Cregg a revised term sheet (together with the price proposal of $23.00 per share, of which 70% would
be comprised of cash and the remaining 30% comprised of Taylor Morrison Common Stock, from the April 20 Proposal, the “April 23 Taylor Morrison
Proposal”). The revised term sheet no longer included contractual exclusivity and no longer locked-up TPG shares in the event of a change of
recommendation by the AV Homes Board, but retained the “naked no vote” break fee.

Also on April 23, 2018, Company F sent a revised non-binding proposal, which proposed a business combination in which Company F would
acquire all outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock for $23.00 per share in cash and a contingent value right, which Company F estimated to be
worth at least an approximate $0.50 per share of AV Homes Common Stock (a “CVR”) (the “April 23 Company F Proposal”). The CVR would have
entitled its holders to cash payments equal to a percentage of the after-tax gain from the sale or sales of specified non-core plots of land owned by AV
Homes. The proposal from Company F also included a draft exclusivity agreement that Company F required AV Homes to enter into as a condition of
entering into negotiations with respect to its proposal, a supplemental due diligence request list and a revised term sheet. The revised term sheet
proposed that TPG would be prevented from terminating its voting obligation in the event of a change of recommendation by the AV Homes Board and
proposed a termination fee of $21 million or approximately 3.4% of the AV Homes equity value implied by the April 23 Company F Proposal.

On April 23, 2018, after receiving the April 23 Taylor Morrison Proposal and the April 23 Company F Proposal, the AV Homes Board held a
meeting, with representatives from AV Homes management, J.P. Morgan, Moelis and Wachtell Lipton in attendance. The purpose of the meeting was for
the AV Homes Board to receive an update on the current stage of AV Homes’ strategic alternatives and related negotiations and to select a bidder with
which to proceed. The representatives from J.P. Morgan and Moelis updated the AV Homes Board on the revised bids and summarized the status of
negotiations. The representative from Wachtell Lipton provided an overview of the directors’ fiduciary duties under Delaware law. The AV Homes
Board then considered a number of factors including the extent to which the two potential counterparties had improved their bids in previous rounds and
the degree of differentiation of the bids, including with respect to the consideration proposed and the contractual terms contained in the potential
counterparties’ respective term sheets, particularly with regard to AV Homes’ freedom of action going forward. The AV Homes Board discussed each
potential counterparty’s interactions with AV Homes and its advisors and the perceived likelihood that a transaction could be successfully negotiated
with each counterparty. The AV Homes Board discussed Company F’s insistence on entering an exclusivity agreement before undertaking further due
diligence. The AV Homes Board also discussed the value attributed to the CVR proposed by Company F, including the difficulty of valuing the CVR,
the high degree of complication entailed in structuring and managing the incentives of parties to such financial instruments, the likelihood that, based on
the assets underlying the CVR, the payouts under the CVR would have been significantly delayed and, ultimately, the consensus of the AV Homes
Board, after discussing the matter with the representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis in attendance at the meeting, that little value should be attributed to
the proposed CVR. The AV Homes Board noted that Taylor Morrison offered consideration that was comparably certain, had observed process deadlines
and had responded to requests from the Company in a timely and satisfactory manner. Based on the foregoing factors, the AV Homes Board determined
to proceed with negotiations with Taylor Morrison so long as Taylor Morrison increased its proposed purchase price, as doing so would maximize the
likelihood of successfully negotiating and consummating a transaction, and directed that representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis contact Citi to
discuss improving Taylor Morrison’s proposed purchase price.

Later on April 23, 2018, at the direction of the AV Homes Board, representatives from J.P. Morgan and Moelis informed representatives from
Taylor Morrison that AV Homes was prepared to work with Taylor Morrison and its advisors, rather than other bidders, to focus on reaching a definitive
agreement with respect to the potential transaction as expeditiously as possible, if Taylor Morrison agreed to increase the headline value of the aggregate
consideration offered in the proposal to $23.50 per share of AV Homes Common Stock.

On April 24, 2018, at the direction of Taylor Morrison, representatives of Citi rejected AV Homes’ proposal to increase the value of the aggregate
consideration to $23.50 per share of AV Homes Common Stock and reiterated Taylor Morrison’s previous $23.00 per share offer. Representatives from
J.P. Morgan and Moelis informed representatives of Citi that AV Homes would not be prepared to proceed with Taylor Morrison unless the headline
value of the aggregate consideration proposed exceeded $23.00 per share of AV Homes Common Stock.

On April 25, 2018, at the direction of Taylor Morrison, representatives from Citi informed representatives from J.P. Morgan and Moelis that
Taylor Morrison was prepared to offer a headline purchase price of $23.05 per share of AV Homes Common Stock. The representatives from J.P.
Morgan and Moelis verbally affirmed that AV Homes would proceed to negotiate with Taylor Morrison on this basis.

On April 26, 2018, at the direction of the AV Homes Board, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis informed representatives from Company F
that AV Homes had determined to proceed with a different bidder.

On April 27, 2018, Wachtell Lipton delivered an initial draft of the merger agreement to Paul, Weiss.

Throughout the month of May, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and representatives of Paul, Weiss advanced the negotiation of the definitive
merger agreement, and, together with Kirkland, advanced the negotiation of the TPG voting agreement. The negotiation of the merger agreement
between Wachtell Lipton and Paul, Weiss primarily focused on the size of the termination fee, the procedural limitations with respect to the ability of the
AV Homes Board to change its recommendation and terminate the merger agreement in accordance with its fiduciary duties and the conditions to
closing, as well as the interim operating covenants to be imposed on AV Homes between signing and closing of the potential transaction. In particular,
Taylor Morrison agreed to forego the proposed “naked no vote” termination fee and AV Homes agreed to matching rights in favor of Taylor Morrison in
the event of an intervening event and a 3.75% termination fee.

On May 8, 2018, Mr. Cregg and Ms. Palmer met and discussed the status of Taylor Morrison’s due diligence and the timing of the potential
acquisition of AV Homes by Taylor Morrison.

On May 10, 2018, Mr. Cregg reached out to Ms. Palmer for an update on Taylor Morrison’s due diligence. Ms. Palmer informed him that based on
a variety of factors it would make sense to get approval of the potential transaction from the Taylor Morrison Board at its regularly scheduled board
meeting on May 30 and 31, 2018.

On May 12, 2018, at the request of Mr. Nash, a representative of TPG had a call with Ms. Palmer to discuss the timing of the process with respect
to the potential transaction, including AV Homes’ view that Taylor Morrison’s due diligence investigation should be accelerated. In response,
Ms. Palmer confirmed Taylor Morrison’s interest in a potential transaction with AV Homes, but insisted that, in order to make a complete proposal,
Taylor Morrison would require sufficient time to complete its due diligence review.

On May 14, 2018, representatives of J.P. Morgan met with Ms. Palmer and discussed the status of due diligence and timing of the potential
transaction between Taylor Morrison and AV Homes.

On May 17, 2018, following a meeting of the Taylor Morrison Board, representatives of Citi communicated that AV Homes would receive a
revised proposal at a lower share price due to diligence findings, higher than expected transaction costs and recent declines of Taylor Morrison’s stock
price.

On May 23, 2018, at the direction of Taylor Morrison, representatives from Citi communicated to representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis that
Taylor Morrison was prepared to move forward with a deal at $21.00 per share (the “May 23 Proposal”). At that time the representatives reiterated that
Taylor Morrison was committed to announcing a deal after its May 30 and 31 board meeting. Taylor Morrison said that the key drivers of the reduced
offer price were its community-level underwriting, its more conservative view on the gross margins of certain AV Homes’ properties, estimated
one-time transaction costs and decreases in Taylor Morrison’s stock price.

On May 24, 2018, the AV Homes Board held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from AV Homes management, J.P. Morgan, Moelis and
Wachtell Lipton. The purpose of the meeting was to update the AV Homes Board on the negotiations between AV Homes and Taylor Morrison.
Representatives from J.P. Morgan and Moelis updated the AV Homes Board on the state of negotiations, including the extensive diligence

conducted by Taylor Morrison and the May 23 Proposal. After engaging in discussions with the financial and legal advisors and each other, the AV
Homes Board unanimously determined that it would not transact at the price of the May 23 Proposal because it did not provide sufficient value to AV
Homes and its stockholders. During its discussion, the AV Homes Board considered options for moving forward, including informing Taylor Morrison
that a transaction could not be agreed upon on the basis of the May 23 Proposal, re-engaging with Company F or abandoning negotiations with both
potential counterparties to permit AV Homes’ management team to return its focus to executing its business plan. The AV Homes Board considered
factors including the course of negotiation and interaction with Company F, the financial advisors’ views that there was a possibility that Taylor
Morrison’s bid could be improved, whether a transaction could be reached with Company F without jeopardizing the advanced status of negotiations
with Taylor Morrison and the overall conditions in the homebuilding market and the disruption caused to AV Homes’ business by continuing
negotiations. After further discussion, the AV Homes Board decided to reject the May 23 Proposal and suspend Taylor Morrison’s access to the data
room.

Later that day, the representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis communicated to representatives of Citi that AV Homes was not prepared to transact
with Taylor Morrison on the terms set forth in its May 23 Proposal.

On May 26, 2018, Ms. Palmer and Mr. Nash spoke by telephone, during which conversation Ms. Palmer conveyed to Mr. Nash that Taylor
Morrison had completed its due diligence and was committed to pursuing the potential transaction. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis spoke
separately with Citi, to understand the factors that had resulted in the reduction in the proposed value of Taylor Morrison’s bid and to convey the view of
the AV Homes Board that greater value would be required for the parties to successfully reach an agreement.

On May 29, 2018, representatives of Citi communicated a revised proposal on behalf of Taylor Morrison to representatives of J.P. Morgan and
Moelis, which proposal consisted of cash consideration of $21.50 per share and stock consideration valued at $21.00 per share (based on a fixed
exchange ratio set at the time of the transaction announcement) (the “May 29 Proposal”). The cash consideration was to represent approximately 62.5%
of the total consideration, and the stock consideration was to represent approximately 37.5% of the total consideration, implying a blended purchase
price of $21.31 per share of AV Homes Common Stock, which represented a 15% premium to the closing price of the AV Homes Common Stock on the
Nasdaq on May 29, 2018. The May 29 Proposal also requested an agreement from TPG to elect 100% stock consideration for its shares, representing the
entirety of the stock component of the proposed consideration. In addition, Taylor Morrison proposed a targeted announcement date of June 4, 2018 and
noted that there were no meaningful outstanding diligence items.

Separately on May 29, 2018, representatives of the financial advisor to Company F reached out to Mr. Cregg, which they do in the ordinary course
of business, to generally inquire about the AV Homes business. During the course of this call, Mr. Cregg inquired as to whether Company F had
provided any further information to its financial advisor with respect to Company F’s interest in a transaction with AV Homes. In response, Company
F’s financial advisor noted that Company F remained interested in an acquisition of AV Homes.

On May 31, 2018, the AV Homes Board held a meeting, with representatives from AV Homes management, J.P. Morgan, Moelis and Wachtell
Lipton in attendance. In addition to regular business, the representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis updated the directors on the status of negotiations
between AV Homes and Taylor Morrison and discussed the May 29 Proposal. The representative from Wachtell Lipton outlined the current open items
in the draft transaction documentation and responded to questions from the members of the AV Homes Board. The members of the AV Homes Board
then discussed Company F’s continued interest in a transaction with AV Homes, including whether, in light of the price offered by Taylor Morrison, a
better price could be achieved by re-engaging with Company F. During the course of this discussion, members of the AV Homes Board noted that
Company F had previously refused to engage without a contractual period of exclusivity, the high likelihood that Company F would require a
meaningful period of time to complete its due diligence

investigation with respect to AV Homes, the risk that Company F could determine to terminate discussions or significantly reduce the price it would be
willing to pay in a potential transaction, the difficulty of valuing the CVR and the likelihood that Taylor Morrison would be unwilling to delay execution
of definitive documentation for a significant period of time. Following this discussion, the AV Homes Board concluded that re-engaging with Company
F presented a meaningful risk that a transaction would not be reached with either potential counterparty and, as a result, that AV Homes should not seek
to re-engage with Company F at that time. However, in light of the recent confirmation of continued interest from Company F and the reduction in value
represented by the May 29 Proposal as compared to the $23.05 proposed on April 25, 2018, which had formed the basis for proceeding with Taylor
Morrison, the AV Homes Board instructed management and its advisors that definitive documentation with respect to the proposed transaction should
include an initial period during which a competing potential acquirer could submit a topping bid with Taylor Morrison entitled only to a lower
termination fee, with the termination fee increasing only following the initial period. Although the AV Homes Board determined that the May 29
Proposal did not provide adequate value, the AV Homes Board determined that it would propose to Taylor Morrison a transaction involving total
consideration of $21.50 per share of AV Homes Common Stock, with the AV Homes stockholders permitted to elect between cash, Taylor Morrison
Common Stock or mixed consideration (at a fixed exchange ratio), together with the bifurcated termination fee structure designed to increase the
potentiality of a competing potential acquirer (whether Company F or any other) proposing to acquire AV Homes following the execution of definitive
transaction documents with Taylor Morrison (the “Board’s May 31 Counter Proposal”). The AV Homes Board and its advisors prepared a term sheet
reflecting the Board’s May 31 Counter Proposal, to be shared with Taylor Morrison.

Later that day, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis communicated the view of the AV Board and sent to representatives of Citi the Board’s
May 31 Counter Proposal, including the term sheet.

Later on May 31, 2018, at the direction of Taylor Morrison, representatives of Citi sent representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis a revised term
sheet that accepted AV Homes’ proposed price of $21.50 per share of AV Homes Common Stock, but reverted to a single tier termination fee structure.

Early on June 1, 2018, representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis delivered a further revised term sheet to representatives of Citi, which reiterated
AV Homes’ requirement that any transaction include a bifurcated termination fee, allowing qualified bidders to pay a lower termination fee of
approximately 2.0% of the equity value of AV Homes implied in the proposed transaction during an initial period post-signing, with non-qualified
bidders and all bidders after the initial period required to pay a 3.75% termination fee. Following further discussion between representatives of Citi and
representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis, Taylor Morrison agreed to proceed on this basis.

During the period between June 1, 2018 and through June 6, 2018, representatives of Wachtell Lipton and representatives of Paul, Weiss
negotiated the final outstanding points in the merger agreement and, together with representatives of Kirkland, advanced the negotiation of the TPG
voting agreement. Negotiations with respect to the merger agreement focused on the financing structure and Taylor Morrison’s and AV Homes’
covenants with respect to financing matters, including with respect to the structure of the marketing period, the mechanical terms of the bifurcated
termination fee, the amount of the termination fees payable by AV Homes in the event of a termination (both during the initial period post-signing and
following the initial post-signing period), the removal of the cap on Taylor Morrison’s matching rights in the event of a superior proposal and the
treatment of AV Homes stock awards in the proposed transaction. With respect to the TPG voting agreement, the legal advisors agreed, after discussion,
that the TPG voting agreement would permit TPG to participate in solicitation activities with respect to alternative transactions in the event that AV
Homes was permitted to do so pursuant to the merger agreement.

On June 4, 2018, AV Homes’ representatives from J.P. Morgan, Moelis and Wachtell Lipton conducted a reverse diligence session with Taylor
Morrison management and representatives from Citi and Paul Weiss.

On June 5, 2018, at the direction of AV Homes, representatives of Moelis returned a call to Company F’s financial advisor and, during the course
of this conversation, explained to Company F’s financial advisor that AV Homes was close to announcing a transaction. In response, Company F’s
financial advisor indicated that Company F continued to be interested in a potential transaction. Although the specific terms of Company F’s continued
interest were not discussed during the conversation, and the financial advisor to Company F did not take the opportunity to confirm the price at which
Company F remained interested in a potential transaction, the financial advisor to Company F did indicate that Company F was not prepared to increase
its offer price at this time.

On June 6, 2018, the AV Homes Board convened and held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from AV Homes management, J.P. Morgan,
Moelis and Wachtell Lipton. Representatives of J.P. Morgan and Moelis summarized the interaction with Taylor Morrison to date. Representatives of J.P.
Morgan and Moelis then reviewed with the AV Homes Board their respective financial analyses relating to the consideration proposed in the potential
merger. Also at this meeting, a representative from Wachtell Lipton discussed key terms of the proposed merger agreement and reviewed with members
of the AV Homes Board their fiduciary duties in the context of the proposed transaction. The Wachtell Lipton representative also reviewed the proposed
resolutions with the AV Homes Board. The AV Homes Board also discussed the recent conversation between representatives of Moelis and Company
F’s financial advisor and Company F’s continued interest in a potential transaction. The AV Homes Board again reviewed the advantages and
disadvantages of re-engaging with Company F, including those discussed at the AV Homes Board’s May 31, 2018 meeting, as well as Taylor Morrison’s
agreement to the concept of a bifurcated termination fee structure. After discussing these considerations, the AV Homes Board concluded that the path
of finalizing the Merger Agreement with Taylor Morrison presented greater certainty that a transaction could be agreed than re-engaging with Company
F and, therefore, the Merger represented a better overall value for AV Homes’ stockholders. The AV Homes Board determined to reconvene later in the
afternoon after receiving confirmation that the Taylor Morrison Board had approved the transaction.

Also on June 6, 2018, the Taylor Morrison Board convened and held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from Taylor Morrison
management, Citi and Paul, Weiss. Ms. Palmer updated the Taylor Morrison Board and reviewed the status of discussions with AV Homes. A
representative from Paul, Weiss reviewed with members of the Taylor Morrison Board their fiduciary duties in the context of the proposed transaction
and the material terms of the merger agreement. After considering and discussing the foregoing and the proposed terms of the merger agreement, the
members of the Taylor Morrison Board unanimously (i) determined that the Merger Agreement, the TPG voting agreement and the other transactions
contemplated thereby were fair and in the best interests of Taylor Morrison and its stockholders and (ii) declared it advisable that Taylor Morrison enter
into the Merger Agreement and the TPG voting agreement.

Later on June 6, 2018, the AV Homes Board reconvened and held a telephonic meeting, with representatives from AV Homes management, J.P.
Morgan, Moelis and Wachtell Lipton. Representatives from J.P. Morgan delivered to the AV Homes Board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion dated June 6, 2018, to the effect that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in
its opinion, the consideration to be paid to the holders of AV Homes Common Stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to
such holders, as more fully described under the heading —Opinions of AV Homes’ Financial Advisors—Opinion of AV Homes’ Financial Advisor, J.P.
Morgan. Also at this meeting, representatives of Moelis delivered to the AV Homes Board an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion dated June 6, 2018, to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in the
opinion, the merger consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of AV Homes Common Stock (other than TPG), is fair, from a financial point
of view, to such holders as more fully described below under the heading —Opinions of AV Homes’ Financial Advisors—Opinion of AV Homes’
Financial Advisor, Moelis.

Following the conclusion of the final AV Homes board meeting, AV Homes, Taylor Morrison, TPG and their respective counsel finalized the
transaction documentation. On June 7, 2018, Taylor Morrison executed its

debt commitment papers with Citi; AV Homes and Taylor Morrison executed the merger agreement; and Taylor Morrison and TPG executed the TPG
voting agreement.

AV Homes and Taylor Morrison jointly announced the transactions on the morning of June 7, 2018.

AV Homes’ Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the AV Homes Board of Directors

In evaluating the Merger and other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the AV Homes Board consulted with AV Homes’ senior
management and AV Homes’ outside legal and financial advisors and, in the course of reaching its unanimous determination to approve the Merger
Agreement and to recommend that AV Homes stockholders vote FOR the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the AV Homes Board considered a
wide and complex range of factors, including the following factors that weighed positively in favor of its decision, among others and not necessarily in
order of relative importance:

Strategic Considerations. The AV Homes Board believes that the Merger presented and is expected to provide a number of significant strategic
opportunities and benefits to AV Homes and its stockholders, including:
 

 

•  the advantages of entering into the Merger Agreement and consummating the Merger in comparison to the risks associated with remaining
independent as a standalone company and pursuing AV Homes’ strategic plan, including (i) the fact that AV Homes’ business is cyclical and
significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions and any slowing or reversal of the present ongoing housing
recovery may materially and adversely affect AV Homes’ business and results of operations, (ii) potential future competition, including from
larger and better funded companies that might have competitive advantages from their broader commercial scope and economies of scale,
(iii) the risks inherent in the homebuilding sector for AV Homes, (iv) the challenges and risks associated with growing AV Homes
organically or through strategic acquisitions and (v) the various additional risk factors pertaining to AV Homes that are listed in Item 1A of
Part I of its most recent Annual Report filed on Form 10-K and, consequently, the belief of the AV Homes Board that an acquisition by
Taylor Morrison provided more value for AV Homes stockholders on a risk-adjusted basis than executing AV Homes’ strategic business
plan;

 

 
•  the belief of the AV Homes Board that the homebuilding industry is currently experiencing a combination of positive macroeconomic

factors, including strong demand, favorable demographics and low supply, in combination with a constructive capital markets environment
where homebuilders are able to access equity and debt capital at attractive rates;

 

 •  that AV Homes currently has a growth profile, management team and geographic footprint that makes it an attractive acquisition target;
 

 

•  the other strategic alternatives reasonably available to AV Homes, including pursuing its stand-alone business plan, potentially making
acquisitions of other businesses, potentially monetizing certain assets, and seeking other potential acquirers, which the AV Homes Board
evaluated with the assistance of AV Homes management and legal and financial advisors in a thorough process to explore AV Homes’
strategic alternatives during which representatives of AV Homes sought offers from various potential buyers, none of whom made offers
providing a combination of value and transaction certainty equivalent to Taylor Morrison’s offers, and the belief of the AV Homes board that
the Merger creates the best reasonably available opportunity to enhance value for AV Homes stockholders given the potential risks, rewards
and uncertainties associated with other alternatives, including the risk that an agreement could be reached with respect to a transaction,
execution risk and risks related to the achievement of anticipated synergies;

 

 
•  that remaining an independent small cap homebuilder presents certain risks and additional costs, including the size of AV Homes’ market

capitalization and relatively lower trading liquidity, higher costs of capital and higher administrative costs;

Table of Contents

 
•  that methods for disposing of non-core assets outside of a merger such as the one contemplated by the Merger Agreement introduce

additional uncertainty and potentially achieve lower value for AV Homes stockholders;
 

 
•  that Taylor Morrison has a history of utilizing mergers and acquisitions to drive growth with the acquisition of four private homebuilders

over the past five years;
 

 
•  that the Merger would result in a combined company that would be the sixth largest homebuilder in the United States based on closings and

homebuilding revenue;
 

 •  that over the past twelve months liquidity in Taylor Morrison Common Stock has increased meaningfully;
 

 
•  the AV Homes Board’s knowledge of AV Homes’ and Taylor Morrison’s respective business, operations, financial condition, earnings and

prospects;
 

 
•  the current and prospective business climate in the industry in which AV Homes and Taylor Morrison operate, including the position of

current and likely competitors of AV Homes and Taylor Morrison;
 

 
•  for the combined company, increased presence in certain markets, diversification across all markets and diversification in product offerings;

and
 

 
•  the financial strength of the combined company and its ability to take advantage of that strength, including a potential rerating of its stock, to

enhance future growth prospects.

Value of the Merger Consideration. The AV Homes Board also believes that the Merger is attractive to AV Homes stockholders, based on a
number of valuation-related factors, including:
 

 

•  the value of the Merger Consideration to be received by AV Homes stockholders in relation to (1) the market price of AV Homes Common
Stock prior to the AV Homes Board’s approval of the Merger Agreement; and (2) the value that could potentially be obtained through other
strategic alternatives available to AV Homes. In connection with these considerations, the AV Homes Board considered the attendant risk
that if AV Homes remained independent, AV Homes Common Stock may not trade at levels equal to or greater than the value of the Merger
Consideration in the near term, over an extended period of time or at all;

 

 
•  that the Merger Consideration, comprised of a combination of cash and stock, provides immediate liquidity and value to AV Homes

stockholders and also provides AV Homes stockholders with the opportunity to participate, through ownership in the combined company, in
the value that the AV Homes Board believes will be created as a result of the Merger;

 

 

•  the fact that the Cash Consideration of $21.50 per share (before giving effect to any proration adjustment), the implied value of the Stock
Consideration of $21.58 per share (before giving effect to any proration adjustment), based on the $22.04 closing price per share of Taylor
Morrison Common Stock on June 6, 2018, the last full trading day before the announcement of the Merger Agreement, and the implied
value of the Mixed Consideration of $21.53, based on the $22.04 closing price per share of Taylor Morrison Common Stock on June 6,
2018, the last full trading day before the announcement of the Merger Agreement, were all higher than the closing price per share of AV
Homes Common Stock in the previous 52 weeks and represented a significant premium over the market prices at which AV Homes
Common Stock had previously traded, including a premium on the value of the Cash Consideration (before giving effect to any proration
adjustment) of approximately 30% over the closing price per share of AV Homes Common Stock on June 6, 2018;

 

 
•  the fact that because the stock portion of the Merger Consideration is a fixed number of shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock, AV

Homes stockholders will have the opportunity to benefit from any potential increase in the trading price of Taylor Morrison Common Stock
pending the completion of the Merger;

Table of Contents

 
•  the fact that a large portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration will be paid in cash, giving AV Homes stockholders the opportunity to

immediately realize liquidity and certain value for a significant portion of their investment;
 

 
•  the fact that AV Homes stockholders would be able to reinvest the cash consideration received in the Merger in Taylor Morrison Common

Stock if they desired to do so;
 

 •  the fact that AV Homes stockholders will benefit from the increased liquidity of Taylor Morrison Common Stock;
 

 
•  the fact that the large cash component of the Merger Consideration will reduce any impact of a decline in the trading price of Taylor

Morrison Common Stock on the value of the Merger Consideration;
 

 

•  the financial analysis reviewed and discussed with the AV Homes Board by representatives of J.P. Morgan, as well as the oral opinion of J.P.
Morgan rendered to the AV Homes Board on June 6, 2018 (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of J.P. Morgan’s
written opinion delivered to the AV Homes Board on the same date) the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration
to be received by holders of AV Homes Common Stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement as more fully described in the section entitled
“—Opinion of AV Homes’ Financial Advisors”;

 

 

•  the financial analysis reviewed and discussed with the AV Homes Board by representatives of Moelis, as well as the oral opinion of Moelis
rendered to the AV Homes Board on June 6, 2018 (which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of Moelis’ written opinion
delivered to the AV Homes Board on the same date) to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to be
received by holders of AV Homes Common Stock (other than TPG) pursuant to the Merger Agreement as more fully described in the section
entitled “—Opinion of AV Homes’ Financial Advisors”; and

 

 

•  the fact that the AV Homes Board’s negotiations with Taylor Morrison resulted in increased closing certainty, as well as the AV Homes
Board’s belief, based on Taylor Morrison’s positions during negotiations, that the final Merger Consideration provided by the Merger
Agreement represented the maximum amount Taylor Morrison would be willing to pay and the best price and overall deal terms that were
reasonably attainable by AV Homes under the circumstances, in particular in light of the fact that Company F’s nominally higher conditional
preliminary proposal, which it submitted on April 23, 2018, provided for uncertain value attributable to the CVR included in that proposal
and was conditioned on the receipt of a contractual period of exclusivity, and the view of the AV Homes Board that Company F would likely
have required a meaningful period of time to complete its due diligence investigation, during which period Company F could determine to
terminate discussions or reduce the price it would be willing to pay in a potential transaction.

Other Factors Considered by the AV Homes Board. In addition to considering the strategic and economic factors described above, the AV Homes
Board considered the following additional factors, all of which it viewed as supporting its decision to approve the Merger Agreement:
 

 

•  the fact that TPG, which beneficially owns approximately 40% of AV Homes Common Stock, entered into a voting agreement with Taylor
Morrison pursuant to which it agreed to support the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as more fully described under the
heading “The Voting Agreement”. Furthermore, the fact that TPG, as a result of its election to receive the Stock Consideration in exchange
for its shares of AV Homes Common Stock means that TPG disproportionately bears the risk of Taylor Morrison Common Stock losing
value between the announcement of the Merger and the effective time of the Merger, as compared to other holders of AV Homes Common
Stock who have the option of electing the Cash Consideration;

 •  the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, including:
 

 

•  the AV Homes Board’s right to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
superior proposal upon payment of a $10,000,000 termination fee (with regard to a transaction proposed by a qualified bidder prior
to the later of July 22, 2018 and one day after the end of a required notice period with respect to a superior proposal) or a
$18,472,000 million termination fee (with regard to a transaction proposed after such time or by a non-qualified bidder) to Taylor
Morrison, which the AV Homes Board was advised were within the customary range of termination fees payable in similar
transactions;

 

 •  the AV Homes Board’s ability under certain circumstances to change its recommendation;
 

 
•  AV Homes’ ability under certain circumstances to respond and become fully informed with respect to unsolicited acquisition or

business combination proposals from third parties and to provide such third parties with confidential information;
 

 
•  AV Homes’ ability to seek specific performance to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement by Taylor Morrison and to enforce

specifically the terms of the Merger Agreement; and
 

 
•  that the Merger Agreement contains terms that, taken as a whole, the AV Homes Board believed provided a significant degree of

certainty that the Merger will be completed as quickly as possible;
 

 
•  the fact that the adoption of the Merger Agreement will be subject to approval by the holders of a majority of the voting power of the

outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock and the fact that there would not be any fee payable solely as a result of an unsuccessful
vote by AV Homes stockholders to approve the merger proposal; and

 

 
•  the fact that appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL are available to holders of AV Homes Common Stock that comply with the

required procedures under the DGCL, which allows such holders to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares of AV Homes Common
Stock as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery in lieu of accepting the Merger Consideration.

The AV Homes Board also considered a number of potential risks and uncertainties in its deliberations concerning the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the following (not necessarily in order of relative importance):
 

 
•  the risk that changes in the regulatory and legislative landscape or new industry developments, including changes in consumer preferences,

may adversely affect the business benefits anticipated to result from the Merger;
 

 

•  the risks and costs to AV Homes if the Merger is not completed, including the potential diversion of management and employee attention,
potential employee attrition, the potential effects on business and customer and supplier relationships, diversion of resources from other
strategic opportunities, the possibility that the trading price of AV Homes Common Stock could be adversely affected, and possibility that
the market’s perception of AV Homes’ prospects could be adversely affected;

 

 

•  the fact that AV Homes has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, regardless of whether they are consummated, and if the Merger and other
transactions are not consummated, AV Homes will be required to pay its own expenses associated with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

 

 
•  the costs associated with the completion of the Merger and the realization of the anticipated benefits expected to be obtained in connection

with the Merger, including management’s time, energy and attention and potential opportunity cost;
 

 
•  the fact that Company F previously submitted a conditional preliminary indication of interest that was nominally for a price per share of AV

Homes Common Stock greater than the aggregate implied value

of the Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to the Merger Agreement, albeit with significant uncertainty attached to the economic and
non-economic terms of such proposal and with no assurance that an agreement could ever be reached with Company F with respect to a
transaction;

 

 
•  the fact that, because approximately 41.2% of the Merger Consideration will be in the form of Taylor Morrison Common Stock, AV Homes

stockholders will have a smaller opportunity to participate in potential earnings or growth of Taylor Morrison and the potential appreciation
in the value of Taylor Morrison Common Stock following the Merger than they currently have in AV Homes;

 

 

•  the fact that the stock portion of the Merger Consideration is a fixed exchange ratio of shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock to AV
Homes Common Stock, so AV Homes stockholders could be adversely affected by a decrease in the trading price of Taylor Morrison
Common Stock during the pendency of the Merger and the fact that the Merger Agreement does not provide AV Homes with a price-based
termination right or similar protection;

 

 
•  the fact that following the Merger, the existing directors of Taylor Morrison will constitute all of the members of the combined company’s

board of directors;
 

 
•  the risk that the potential benefits of the Merger may not be fully or partially achieved, or may not be achieved within the expected

timeframe;
 

 

•  the potential challenges and difficulties relating to integrating the operations of AV Homes and Taylor Morrison after consummation of the
Merger, including the cost to achieve synergies, which will require consolidating certain businesses and functions, integrating organizations,
procedures, policies and operations, addressing differences in the business cultures of the two companies and retaining key personnel, and
may disrupt each company’s ongoing business operations or adversely affect relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and others;

 

 

•  certain provisions of the Merger Agreement could have the effect of discouraging third party offers for AV Homes, including the restriction
on AV Homes’ ability to solicit third party proposals for alternative transactions involving AV Homes and the applicable termination fee AV
Homes would be required to pay Taylor Morrison to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to accept a superior proposal from a third
party;

 

 
•  the interim restrictions on the conduct of AV Homes’ business prior to the completion of the Merger, which restrictions generally require AV

Homes to operate its businesses in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice with certain exceptions, which may delay or
prevent AV Homes from undertaking business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger;

 

 
•  the fact that certain executive officers of AV Homes have, and the possibility that other executive officers and directors of AV Homes could

have, interests in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that are different from, or in addition to, those of AV Homes’
stockholders;

 

 
•  the risk that, despite the efforts of AV Homes and Taylor Morrison prior to the consummation of the Merger, AV Homes may lose key

personnel, and the potential resulting negative effects on AV Homes’ and, ultimately, Taylor Morrison’s businesses;
 

 
•  the potential for litigation challenging the Merger, and the possibility that an adverse judgment for monetary damages could have a material

adverse effect on the operations of the combined company after the Merger or that an adverse judgment granting permanent injunctive relief
could indefinitely enjoin completion of the Merger; and

 

 •  various other risks associated with the combination of the businesses of AV Homes and Taylor Morrison described under “Risk Factors.”

The AV Homes Board concluded that these potential risks and uncertainties were outweighed by the benefits that the AV Homes Board expected
AV Homes and its stockholders to achieve as a result of the Merger. The AV Homes Board realized that there can be no assurance about future results,
including results considered or expected as disclosed in the foregoing reasons.

The foregoing discussion of information and material factors considered by the AV Homes Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but it does
describe the principal factors considered by the AV Homes Board as aforementioned herein. In view of the variety of factors and substantial amount of
information considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger, the AV Homes Board did not find it practicable to,
and did not, seek to quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the factors summarized above in reaching its conclusions and in making its
recommendation to AV Homes stockholders to affirmatively vote for the adoption of the Merger Agreement. In addition, each individual member of the
AV Homes Board applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have given different weight to different factors. Except as
specifically described above, the AV Homes Board did not reach any collective view that any individual factor described above either supported or did
not support the overall recommendation of the AV Homes Board. The factors, potential risks and uncertainties contained in this explanation of the AV
Homes Board’s reasons for the Merger and other information presented in this section contain information that is forward-looking in nature and,
therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed in “Cautionary Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

In considering the recommendation of the AV Homes Board that AV Homes stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the Merger Agreement, FOR
the proposal to approve Merger-related executive compensation and FOR the adjournment proposal, AV Homes stockholders should be aware and take
into account the fact that certain AV Homes directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the
interests of AV Homes stockholders generally and that may create potential conflicts of interest. The AV Homes Board was aware of and carefully
considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the terms and structure, and overseeing the negotiation, of the Merger, in approving the
Merger Agreement and in recommending that AV Homes stockholders vote FOR the adoption of the Merger Agreement, FOR the proposal to approve
Merger-related executive compensation and FOR the adjournment proposal. For more information on the interests of certain AV Homes directors and
executive officers, see “—Interests of Certain AV Homes Directors and Officers in the Merger.”

Opinions of AV Homes’ Financial Advisors

Opinion of AV Homes’ Financial Advisor, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC

Pursuant to an engagement letter dated February 22, 2018, AV Homes retained J.P. Morgan as its financial advisor in connection with the
proposed Merger.

At the meeting of the AV Homes Board on June 6, 2018, J.P. Morgan rendered its oral opinion to the AV Homes Board, later confirmed by the
delivery of a written opinion, dated June 6, 2018, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its opinion,
the consideration to be paid to the holders of AV Homes Common Stock in the proposed Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
The full text of the written opinion of J.P. Morgan, which sets forth the assumptions made, matters considered and limits on the review undertaken, is
attached as Annex C to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the opinion of J.P. Morgan set forth in
this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. AV Homes stockholders are urged to read the
opinion in its entirety.

J.P. Morgan’s written opinion was addressed to the AV Homes Board (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its
evaluation of the proposed Merger, was directed only to the consideration to be paid in the Merger and did not address any other aspect of the Merger.
J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the consideration to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
AV Homes or as to the underlying decision by AV Homes to engage in the proposed Merger. The issuance of J.P. Morgan’s opinion was approved by a
fairness committee of J.P. Morgan. The opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of AV Homes as to how such stockholder
should vote with respect to the proposed Merger or any other matter, including, without limitation, whether any stockholder should elect to receive
Stock Consideration, Cash Consideration or Mixed Consideration or to make no election in the Merger.

Table of Contents

In arriving at its opinions, J.P. Morgan, among other things:
 

 •  reviewed a draft of the Merger Agreement dated June 6, 2018 ;
 

 •  reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information concerning AV Homes and the industries in which it operates;
 

 
•  compared the proposed financial terms of the Merger with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies

J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and the consideration received for such companies;
 

 
•  compared the financial and operating performance of AV Homes with publicly available information concerning certain other companies

J.P. Morgan deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the AV Homes Common Stock and certain publicly
traded securities of such other companies;

 

 
•  reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by the management of AV Homes relating to the business of AV Homes;

and
 

 
•  performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other information as J.P. Morgan deemed appropriate for the

purposes of its opinion.

In addition, J.P. Morgan held discussions with certain members of the management of AV Homes with respect to certain aspects of the Merger,
and the past and current business operations of AV Homes, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of AV Homes, the effects of the
Merger on the financial condition and future prospects of AV Homes, and certain other matters J.P. Morgan believed necessary or appropriate to its
inquiry.

In giving its opinion, J.P. Morgan relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was
furnished to or discussed with J.P. Morgan by AV Homes or otherwise reviewed by or for J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan did not independently verify any
such information or its accuracy or completeness and, pursuant to its engagement letter with AV Homes, J.P. Morgan did not assume any obligation to
undertake such independent verification. J.P. Morgan did not conduct and was not provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities,
nor did J.P. Morgan evaluate the solvency of AV Homes or Taylor Morrison under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to J.P. Morgan or derived therefrom, J.P. Morgan assumed that they were reasonably
prepared based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of
operations and financial condition of AV Homes to which such analyses or forecasts relate. J.P. Morgan expressed no view as to such analyses or
forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement will have the tax consequences described in materials furnished to J.P. Morgan by representatives of AV Homes and would be consummated
as described in the Merger Agreement, and that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished
to J.P. Morgan. J.P. Morgan also assumed that the representations and warranties made by AV Homes, Taylor Morrison and Merger Sub in the Merger
Agreement and the related agreements were and will be true and correct in all respects material to its analysis. J.P Morgan is not a legal, regulatory or
tax expert and relied on the assessments made by advisors to AV Homes with respect to such issues. J.P. Morgan further assumed that all material
governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on
AV Homes or Taylor Morrison or on the contemplated benefits of the Merger.

J.P. Morgan’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to
J.P. Morgan as of, the date of such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion noted that subsequent developments may affect J.P. Morgan’s opinion and that
J.P. Morgan does not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm such opinion. J.P. Morgan’s opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial
point of

view, of the consideration to be received by the holders of AV Homes Common Stock in the proposed Merger, and J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as
to the fairness of any consideration to the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of AV Homes or the underlying
decision by AV Homes to engage in the Merger. Furthermore, J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any
compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any party to the proposed Merger, or any class of such persons relative to the consideration to be
paid to the holders of AV Homes Common Stock in the proposed Merger or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation. J.P. Morgan’s opinion
did not address (i) the allocation of the consideration as between holders of AV Homes Common Stock who receive the Stock Consideration, the Cash
Consideration or the Mixed Consideration or (ii) the relative fairness of the Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration and the Mixed Consideration.
J.P. Morgan expressed no opinion as to the price at which the AV Homes Common Stock or Taylor Morrison Common Stock will trade at any future
time.

The terms of the Merger Agreement, including the consideration, were determined through arm’s length negotiations between AV Homes and
Taylor Morrison, and the decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the AV Homes Board and the Taylor Morrison Board.
J.P. Morgan’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of the many factors considered by the AV Homes Board in its evaluation of the proposed
Merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the AV Homes Board or management with respect to the proposed Merger or the
Merger Consideration.

In accordance with customary investment banking practice, J.P. Morgan employed generally accepted valuation methodology in rendering its
opinion to the AV Homes Board on June 6, 2018 and contained in the presentation delivered to the AV Homes Board on such date in connection with the
rendering of such opinion and does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by J.P. Morgan. Some of the summaries of
the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables are not intended to stand alone, and in order to more fully understand
the financial analyses used by J.P. Morgan, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. Considering the data set forth below
without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of J.P. Morgan’s analyses.

Public Trading Multiples. J.P. Morgan compared selected publicly available financial data of AV Homes with similar publicly available data for
selected publicly traded companies engaged in businesses which J.P. Morgan judged to be analogous to AV Homes. The companies selected by
J.P. Morgan were: William Lyon Homes, Beazer Homes, Century Communities, M/I Homes, Green Brick Partners and New Home Company. These
companies were selected, among other reasons, because they were publicly traded companies engaged in the homebuilding business with operations
that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to those of AV Homes. For each comparable company, J.P. Morgan calculated
and compared the multiple of equity market price per share (i) to research analysts’ consensus estimates for earnings for fiscal year 2018 (“P/E 2018E”)
and (ii) to such company’s tangible book value as at March 31, 2018 (“P/TBV”), in each case based on publicly available information. In addition, J.P.
Morgan also reviewed and compared research analysts’ consensus estimates and AV Homes management forecasts for AV Homes’ P/E 2018E and
P/TBV.

Results of the analysis are as follows:
 

   P/E 2018E   P/TBV 
William Lyons Homes    8.0x    1.4x 
Beazer Homes    9.6x    0.9x 
Century Communities    7.6x    1.2x 
M/I Homes    6.9x    1.1x 
Green Brick Partners    10.8x    1.4x 
New Home Company    9.8x    0.8x 
Trading Multiples Average    8.8x    1.1x 
Trading Multiples Median    8.8x    1.1x 
AV Homes (consensus)    11.7x    1.0x 
AV Homes (management)    8.8x    1.0x 

Based on the results of this analysis, J.P. Morgan derived a multiple reference range for P/E 2018E earnings per share of 7.0x – 11.75x and a
multiple reference range of 0.8x – 1.4x for P/TBV for AV Homes.

These multiples were then applied to AV Homes estimated tangible book value as of March 31, 2018 and 2018E earnings per share based on AV
Homes management forecasts, yielding implied equity values for the AV Homes common stock of approximately $13.75 to $24.25 per share for tangible
book value and $13.25 to $22.25 for 2018E EPS, as compared to the AV Homes closing share price of $16.65 on June 5, 2018 and the implied value of
the Merger Consideration of $21.50.

Selected Transaction Analysis. Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan examined selected transactions with respect to homebuilder
transactions. Specifically, J.P. Morgan reviewed the following transactions:
 
Acquirer   Target      

Month/Year
Announced  

Public/Public Transactions  
Century Communities    UCP, Inc.      April 2017  
Lennar    WCI Communities       September 2016  

Public/Private Transactions       
William Lyon Homes    RSI Communities       February 2018  

Foreign buyer / Sponsor Transactions       
TPG/Oaktree    Taylor Morrison       March 2011  

For Reference Only       
Daiwa    Stanley Martin Homes       October 2016  
William Lyon Homes    Polygon Northwest Homes       June 2014  

Using publicly available information, J.P. Morgan calculated, for each selected transaction, the ratio of the equity purchase price to the target
company’s tangible book equity. This analysis resulted in, with respect to the selected transactions other than the for reference only transactions, with
the following equity purchase price to tangible book equity multiples of: 0.9x for Century Communications/UCP, Inc.; 1.3x for Lennar/WCI
Communications; 1.5x for William Lyon Homes/RSI Communities; and 0.9x for TPG/Oaktree/Taylor Morrison. Based on the foregoing analysis
J.P. Morgan derived a multiple reference range of 0.9x to 1.5x.

J.P. Morgan applied this range of multiples derived from such analysis to the AV Homes P/TBV as of March 31, 2018 and arrived at an estimated
range of implied equity values for AV Homes common stock of between $15.50 and $26.00 per share, as compared to the AV Homes closing share price
of $16.65 on June 5, 2018 and the implied value of the Merger Consideration of $21.50.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. J.P. Morgan conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied standalone
equity present value per share for the AV Homes common stock based on forecasts provided by management of AV Homes, adjusted by AV Homes
management on June 5, 2018, to reflect updated information regarding AV Homes’ estimated cash balance at June 30, 2018, and projected real estate
inventory spend for the second half of 2018.

A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using estimates of the future unlevered free cash flows generated by the asset
and taking into consideration the time value of money with respect to those future cash flows by calculating their “present value.” The “unlevered free
cash flows” refer to a calculation of the future cash flows of an asset without including in such calculation any debt servicing costs. “Present value”
refers to the current value of one or more future cash payments from the asset, which is referred to as that asset’s cash flows, and is obtained by
discounting those cash flows back to the present using a discount rate that takes into account macro-economic assumptions and estimates of risk, the
opportunity cost of capital, capitalized returns and other appropriate factors. “Terminal value” refers to the capitalized value of all cash flows from an
asset for periods beyond the final forecast period.

J.P. Morgan calculated the present value of the unlevered free cash flows that AV Homes is expected to generate during fiscal years 2018 through
2022 based upon financial forecasts prepared by the management of AV Homes, adjusted by AV Homes management on June 5, 2018, to reflect updated
information regarding AV Homes’ estimated cash balance at June 30, 2018, and projected real estate inventory spend for the second half of 2018, as
reflected below in “—Unaudited Projected Financial Information.”

J.P. Morgan also calculated a range of terminal values of AV Homes at the end of the 5-year period ending 2022 by applying a terminal value
growth rate ranging from (0.5)% to 0.5% to the unlevered free cash flow of AV Homes during the final year of the 5-year period. The unlevered free
cash flows for the second half of 2018 and 2019-22 and the range of terminal values were then discounted to present values using a range of discount
rates from 8.75% to 9.75%, which were chosen by J.P. Morgan based upon an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of AV Homes performed
by J.P. Morgan (taking into consideration capitalization and market data for AV Homes and the other selected public companies referred to above).
Based on the management forecasts, including forecasts provided by management of AV Homes, adjusted by AV Homes management on June 5, 2018,
to reflect updated information regarding AV Homes’ estimated cash balance at June 30, 2018, and projected real estate inventory spend for the second
half of 2018, the discounted cash flow analysis indicated a range of implied equity values per share of AV Homes Common Stock of between $18.75
and $28.25, as compared to the AV Homes closing share price of $16.65 on June 5, 2018 and the implied value of the Merger Consideration of $21.50.

Other Information.

Analyst Price Target

J.P. Morgan reviewed the price target for AV Homes published by an equity research analyst following AV Homes. The analyst price target of
$19.00 per share was compared to AV Homes closing share price of $16.65 on June 5, 2018, and the implied value of the Merger Consideration of
$21.50 per share.

The analyst price target was presented merely for reference purposes only and was not relied upon for valuation purposes.

52-Week Trading Range

J.P. Morgan reviewed the trading range of AV Homes common stock for the 52-week period ended June 5, 2018, which was $14.65 per share to
$20.50 per share and compared that to AV Homes closing share price of $16.65 on June 5, 2018 and the implied value of the Merger Consideration of
$21.50.

Miscellaneous

The foregoing summary of certain material financial analyses does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses or data presented by
J.P. Morgan. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description.
J.P. Morgan believes that the foregoing summary and its analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of the foregoing summary
and these analyses, without considering all of its analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying the analyses and its
opinion. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis or combination of analyses described above were merely utilized to
create points of reference for analytical purposes and should not be taken to be the view of J.P. Morgan with respect to the actual value of AV Homes.
The order of analyses described does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by J.P. Morgan. In arriving at its opinion,
J.P. Morgan did not attribute any particular weight to any analyses or factors considered by it and did not form an opinion as to whether any individual
analysis or factor (positive or negative), considered in isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion. Rather, J.P. Morgan considered the totality of
the factors and analyses performed in determining its opinion.

Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are inherently uncertain, as they are subject to numerous factors or events beyond the control of
the parties and their advisors. Accordingly, forecasts and analyses used or made by J.P. Morgan are not necessarily indicative of actual future results,
which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by those analyses. Moreover, J.P. Morgan’s analyses are not and do not purport to be
appraisals or otherwise reflective of the prices at which businesses actually could be acquired or sold. None of the selected companies reviewed as
described in the above summary is identical to AV Homes, and none of the selected transactions reviewed was identical to the Merger. However, the
companies selected were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations and businesses that, for purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis,
may be considered similar to those of AV Homes. The transactions selected were similarly chosen because their participants, size and other factors, for
purposes of J.P. Morgan’s analysis, may be considered similar to the Merger. The analyses necessarily involve complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences in financial and operational characteristics of the companies involved and other factors that could affect the companies compared
to AV Homes and the transactions compared to the Merger.

As a part of its investment banking business, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates are continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their
securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, investments for passive and control purposes, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions
of listed and unlisted securities, private placements, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. J.P. Morgan was selected to advise AV Homes with
respect to the Merger and deliver an opinion to the AV Homes Board with respect to the Merger on the basis of, among other things, such experience
and its qualifications and reputation in connection with such matters and its familiarity with AV Homes and the industries in which it operates.

J.P. Morgan received from AV Homes a retainer fee of $175,000 and a fee of $1.50 million for the delivery of its opinion. AV Homes has agreed to
pay J.P. Morgan a transaction fee of approximately $6.8 million, against which the retainer fee and the opinion fee will be credited, upon the
consummation of the Merger. In addition, AV Homes has agreed to reimburse J.P. Morgan for certain of its expenses incurred in connection with its
services, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, and will indemnify J.P. Morgan against certain liabilities arising out of J.P. Morgan’s
engagement. During the two years preceding the date of J.P. Morgan’s opinion, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates have had commercial or investment banking
relationships with AV Homes, Taylor Morrison and TPG and certain of TPG’s affiliates, for which J.P. Morgan and J.P. Morgan affiliates have received
customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead arranger and bookrunner on the AV Homes revolving
credit facility which closed in May 2017, joint lead bookrunner on the AV Homes offering of securities which closed in May 2017, joint lead
bookrunner on the Taylor Morrison

offerings of equity securities which closed in January 2017, March 2017 and May 2017, joint lead arranger and bookrunner on the TPG revolving credit
facility which closed in May 2018, joint lead bookrunner on an affiliate of TPG’s offering of equity securities which closed in March 2018, joint lead
bookrunner on an affiliate of TPG’s offering of debt securities which closed in January 2018 and joint lead bookrunner on an affiliate of TPG’s offering
of equity securities which closed in June 2017. In addition, J.P. Morgan’s commercial banking affiliate is an agent bank and a lender under outstanding
credit facilities of AV Homes and certain affiliates of TPG, for which J.P. Morgan receives customary compensation or other financial benefits. In
addition, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of AV Homes and Taylor
Morrison. During the two year period preceding delivery of its opinion, the aggregate fees received by J.P. Morgan from AV Homes were $3.1 million
and from Taylor Morrison were $2.7 million. In the ordinary course of their businesses, J.P. Morgan and its affiliates may actively trade the debt and
equity securities of AV Homes or Taylor Morrison for their own accounts or for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, they may at any time hold
long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.

Opinion of AV Homes’ Financial Advisor, Moelis & Company LLC

At the meeting of the AV Homes Board on June 6, 2018, Moelis delivered an oral opinion, which was confirmed by delivery of a written opinion,
dated June 6, 2018, addressed to the AV Homes Board to the effect that, as of the date of the opinion and based upon and subject to the conditions and
limitations set forth in the opinion, the merger consideration to be received in the Merger by holders of AV Homes Common Stock (other than TPG
Aviator, L.P.), is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The shares of AV Homes Common Stock held by TPG Aviator, L.P., although
identical to the shares held by other holders, were not considered as part of Moelis’ analysis and were excluded from the Moelis opinion because TPG
Aviator, L.P. entered into a voting agreement with Taylor Morrison, pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, among other
things, TPG Aviator, L.P. agreed to vote all Subject Shares (as defined in the voting agreement) in favor of the Merger and make an election to receive
the Stock Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement. TPG Aviator, L.P. was excluded from Moelis’ opinion pursuant to Moelis’
established policies and procedures, whereby Moelis excludes significant stockholders from its fairness opinions in certain circumstances, including
where a significant stockholder enters into a voting agreement.

The full text of Moelis’ written opinion dated June 6, 2018, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex D to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference. Moelis’ opinion was provided for the use and benefit of the AV Homes Board
(solely in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the Merger. Holders of AV Homes Common Stock are urged to read Moelis’ written opinion
carefully and in its entirety. Moelis’ opinion is limited solely to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration and
does not address AV Homes’ underlying business decision to effect the Merger or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any
alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to AV Homes. Moelis’ opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to
how any stockholder of AV Homes should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any other matter. Moelis’ opinion was approved by a Moelis
fairness opinion committee.

In arriving at its opinion, Moelis, among other things:
 

 
•  reviewed certain publicly available business and financial information relating to AV Homes and Taylor Morrison, including publicly

available research analysts’ financial forecasts for AV Homes and Taylor Morrison;
 

 
•  reviewed certain internal information relating to the business, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of AV Homes furnished to

Moelis by AV Homes, including financial forecasts provided to or discussed with Moelis by the management of AV Homes (the
“Management Forecasts”);

“Expected Synergies”) furnished to Moelis by Taylor Morrison;
 

 
•  conducted discussions with members of the senior managements and representatives of AV Homes and Taylor Morrison concerning the

information described in the foregoing, as well as the businesses and prospects of AV Homes and Taylor Morrison generally;

In connection with its review, Moelis, with the consent of the AV Homes Board, relied on the information supplied to, discussed with or reviewed
by it for purposes of its opinion being complete and accurate in all respects material to its opinion. Moelis did not assume any responsibility for
independent verification of any such information. With the consent of the AV Homes Board, Moelis relied upon, without independent verification, the
assessment of AV Homes and its legal, tax, regulatory and accounting advisors with respect to legal, tax, regulatory and accounting matters. With
respect to the financial forecasts and other information relating to AV Homes and the Expected Synergies referred to above, Moelis assumed, at the
direction of the AV Homes Board, that they were reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of AV Homes as to the future performance of AV Homes and the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of
Taylor Morrison as to such Expected Synergies. Moelis expressed no views as to the reasonableness of any financial forecasts or the assumptions on
which they were based. In addition, with the consent of the AV Homes Board, Moelis did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the
assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet, or otherwise) of AV Homes or Taylor Morrison, nor was Moelis furnished with any such
evaluation or appraisal.

Moelis’ opinion did not address AV Homes’ underlying business decision to effect the Merger or the relative merits of the Merger as compared to
any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to AV Homes and did not address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting
matters. At the direction of the AV Homes Board, Moelis was not asked to, nor did it, offer any opinion as to any terms of the Merger Agreement or any
aspect or implication of the Merger, except for the fairness of the Merger Consideration from a financial point of view to the holders of AV Homes
Common Stock (other than TPG Aviator, L.P.). With the consent of the AV Homes Board, Moelis expressed no opinion as to what the value of Taylor
Morrison Common Stock actually would be when issued pursuant to the Merger or the prices at which AV Homes Common Stock or Taylor Morrison
Common Stock may trade at any time. In rendering its opinion, Moelis assumed, with the consent of the AV Homes Board, that the final executed form
of the Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft that Moelis reviewed, that the Merger would be consummated in
accordance with its terms without any waiver or modification that could be material to Moelis’ analysis, and that the parties to the Merger Agreement
would comply with all the material terms of the Merger Agreement. Moelis assumed, with the consent of the AV Homes Board, that all governmental,
regulatory or other consents or approvals necessary for the completion of the Merger would be obtained, except to the extent that could not be material
to Moelis’ analysis. Except as described in this summary, AV Homes and the AV Homes Board imposed no other

instructions or limitations on Moelis with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by Moelis in rendering its opinion.

Moelis’ opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to
Moelis as of, the date of the opinion, and Moelis assumed no responsibility to update the opinion for developments after the date of the opinion.

Moelis’ opinion did not address the fairness of the Merger or any aspect or implication of the Merger to, or any other consideration of or relating
to, the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of AV Homes (including the AV Homes Convertible Notes), other than the
fairness of the Merger Consideration from a financial point of view to the holders of AV Homes Common Stock (other than TPG Aviator, L.P.). In
addition, Moelis did not express any opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be received by any officers, directors or
employees of any parties to the Merger, or any class of such persons, relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. Moelis’ opinion was approved
by a Moelis fairness opinion committee.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses presented by Moelis to the AV Homes Board at its meeting held on June 6, 2018, in
connection with its opinion.

Some of the summaries of financial analyses below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Moelis’ analyses,
the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the analyses. Considering
the data described below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions
underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Moelis’ analyses.

Unless the context indicates otherwise, for purposes of, among other things, deriving per share implied equity value, per share amounts for AV
Homes were based on diluted shares outstanding as of June 5, 2018, of 26.9 million shares as provided by AV Homes’ management, using the treasury
stock method, assuming conversion of the AV Homes Convertible Notes but not including the effect of the make-whole provision associated with a
change of control under the AV Homes Convertible Notes.

Financial Analyses of AV Homes

For purposes of the financial analyses described in this section “—Opinion of AV Homes’ Financial Advisor, Moelis  & Company LLC”, the term
“implied Merger Consideration” refers to the implied value of the per share consideration provided for in the Merger of $21.50 consisting of (i) the
implied value of the consideration of 0.9793 shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock based on the volume-weighted average trading price of the
Taylor Morrison Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the ten trading days ending June 5, 2018, or (ii) $21.50 in cash, or (iii) $12.64
in cash plus the implied value of 0.4034 shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock based on the volume-weighted average trading price of the Taylor
Morrison Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange during the ten trading days ending June 5, 2018.

Selected Public Companies Analysis. Moelis reviewed financial and stock market information of selected U.S. publicly traded small cap
homebuilding companies that Moelis deemed generally relevant to AV. Moelis reviewed (i) the closing fully diluted equity value on June 5, 2018 of each
of the selected public companies as a multiple of tangible book value (“Tangible Book Value”) of the relevant company (calculated as the book value of
the relevant company’s common equity less goodwill as of the relevant company’s most recently reported quarter end) and (ii) the closing stock price on
June 5, 2018 of each of the selected public companies as a multiple of estimated 2018 fiscal year (“2018E”) earnings per share (“EPS”). Moelis also
reviewed corresponding information for AV Homes based on (i) AV Homes Common Stock closing stock price on June 5, 2018, and (ii) the implied
Merger Consideration. Financial data for the selected public companies was based on publicly available median consensus research analysts’ estimates,
public filings and other publicly available

information. 2018E EPS data for AV Homes was derived from the Management Forecasts. Moelis focused on multiples of Tangible Book Value but also
considered multiples of 2018E EPS as a relevant metric.

The results of this analysis are summarized in the following table:
 

   Price  

   

Tangible
Book
Value   

2018E
EPS  

Selected Public Companies    
William Lyon Homes    1.42x   8.0x

M/I Homes, Inc.    1.06x   6.9x 
Green Brick Partners, Inc.    1.42x   10.8x 
Beazer Homes USA, Inc.    0.89x   9.6x 
The New Home Company Inc.    0.83x   9.8x

Median    1.15x   8.8x 
AV Homes at June 5, 2018 (Management Forecasts)    0.97x   8.8x 
AV Homes at June 5, 2018 (consensus)    0.97x   11.7x 
AV Homes at Implied Merger Consideration (Management Forecasts)    1.23x(1)    11.3x 
AV Homes at Implied Merger Consideration (consensus)    1.23x(1)    15.1x 

 
(1) Does not include effect of the make-whole provision associated with a change of control under the AV Homes Convertible Notes.

Based on the foregoing and using its professional judgment, Moelis selected reference range multiples of (i) 1.0x – 1.3x Price / Tangible Book
Value, and (ii) 7.5x – 10.5x Price / 2018E EPS. Moelis then applied such multiple ranges to corresponding financial data for AV Homes (based on the
Tangible Book Value of AV Homes at March 31, 2018, of $389.6 million, assuming no conversion of the AV Homes Convertible Notes and
$469.6 million, assuming conversion of the AV Homes Convertible Notes but excluding the effect of any make-whole provision, and management’s
estimate of 2018E EPS of $1.90 per share as set forth in the Management Forecasts). This analysis indicated the following implied per share reference
ranges for AV Homes, rounded to the nearest $0.05, as compared to the implied Merger Consideration:
 

Implied Per Share Reference Range   
Implied Merger
Consideration

Price / Tangible Book Value   Price / 2018E EPS   
$17.10-$22.65   $14.20-$19.90   $21.50

In connection with its selected public companies analysis, Moelis noted that: the universe of selected public companies differs from AV Homes in
that William Lyon Homes, M/I Homes, Inc., Century Communities, Inc. and Beazer Homes USA, Inc. each have greater scale, geographic diversity and
are more liquid stocks than AV Homes, factors which typically warrant higher valuations; AV Homes has more concentrated ownership than its peers,
with TPG owning an approximately 38% common ownership stake; like AV Homes, Green Brick Partners, Inc. and The New Home Company Inc. are
less liquid with limited research coverage; Green Brick Partners, Inc. has a different business model, being a third party land developer with majority
interests in several home builders, but is of a similar size to AV Homes and also has a concentrated equity holder; and as a proportion of total product
offering, AV Homes serves active adult customers, which are typically viewed as a more attractive market, more than any of the selected public peers.
Moelis also reviewed the selected public companies’ multiples of estimated fiscal year 2019 (“2019E”) EPS, but did not rely on them in its analysis.
Moelis believed that, at the time of its analysis, the market generally recognized that there was limited visibility into 2019E EPS,

particularly for smaller homebuilders like AV Homes and the selected public companies. However, Moelis noted, for reference purposes, that applying
the current 2019E EPS multiple range for the selected public companies to AV Homes’ management’s current 2019E EPS estimates would result in a
range of $22.05 to $32.20, rounded to the nearest $0.05.

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis. Moelis reviewed financial information of certain selected transactions in the U.S. homebuilding
industry announced since January 1, 2009, with a purchase price of equity greater than $200 million and less than $1 billion. Moelis reviewed implied
transaction values of the selected transactions as a multiple of implied equity value to Tangible Book Value as of the target company’s most recently
reported quarter end for which financial information was publicly available immediately preceding announcement of the relevant transaction. Implied
transaction values for the target companies were calculated using the implied purchase prices paid for the common equity of the target companies.

The results of this analysis are summarized in the following table:
 

Announcement Date  Target  Acquiror  

Purchase
Price of

Equity / Tangible
Book Value  

February 20, 2018  RSI Communities LLC  William Lyon Homes   1.54x 
April 11, 2017  UCP, Inc.  Century Communities, Inc.   0.95x 
October 26, 2016  Stanley Martin Communities, LLC  Daiwa House Industry Co., Ltd.   1.62x 
September 22, 2016  WCI Communities, Inc.  Lennar Corp.   1.29x 
June 23, 2014  Polygon Northwest Company LLC  William Lyon Homes   1.69x 
March 31, 2011

 
Taylor Woodrow Holdings (USA), Inc. /
Monarch Corporation  TMM Holdings Limited Partnership   0.87x 

Mean     1.33x 
Median     1.42x 

Based on the foregoing and using its professional judgment, Moelis selected reference range multiples of 1.0x to 1.5x Tangible Book Value.
Moelis then applied such multiple range to the Tangible Book Value of AV Homes at March 31, 2018 of (x) $389.6 million assuming no conversion of
the AV Homes Convertible Notes and (y) $469.6 million assuming conversion of the AV Homes Convertible Notes but excluding the effect of any
make-whole provision. This analysis indicated the following implied per share reference range for AV Homes, rounded to the nearest $0.05, as
compared to the implied transaction consideration:
 

Implied Per Share Reference Range   Implied Merger Consideration
$17.10-$26.10   $21.50

In reviewing the characteristics of the selected precedent transactions for purposes of determining a reference range, Moelis noted that five of the
six transactions were outside Moelis’ selected multiple range. Moelis believed that AV Homes’ valuation multiple fell within the range taking into
account that: WCI Communities, Inc. transacted at a multiple within the selected range and was similar to AV Homes as it was a public company with a
focus on active adult product in the Florida market; Taylor Woodrow Holdings (USA), Inc. / Monarch Corporation was sold early in the current market
cycle when overall valuations were lower; Stanley Martin Communities, LLC held leading market share in an attractive Washington, D.C. market and
had a long operating history, leading to an enhanced multiple; Polygon Northwest Company LLC held leading market share in highly attractive and high
barrier-to-entry markets in Seattle and Portland, driving a premium to other precedents; and Moelis believed that UCP, Inc. and RSI Communities LLC
represented less relevant transactions due to their limited operating history. Moelis also noted that certain data underlying the selected precedent
transactions pre-dated and/or does not reflect the impact of the federal tax legislation enacted in December 2017, which generally would be expected to
drive an increase in transaction values.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Moelis performed a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis of AV Homes using the Management Forecasts and
other information and data provided by management of AV Homes for the period beginning with the last two quarters of 2018 through the year ending
2022 to calculate the standalone present value as of June 30, 2018, of the estimated future unlevered free cash flows projected to be generated by AV
Homes. Unlevered free cash flow estimates for the last two quarters of 2018 were based on estimated full year 2018 forecasts provided by management
of AV Homes, adjusted by AV Homes management on June 5, 2018, to reflect updated information regarding AV Homes’ estimated cash balance at
June 30, 2018, and projected real estate inventory spend for the second half of 2018. The unlevered free cash flow figures utilized by Moelis are
reflected below in “—Unaudited Projected Financial Information.”

In performing the DCF analysis of AV Homes, Moelis used a range of discount rates of 8.0% to 10.0% based on an estimate of AV Homes’
weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) using the mid-year convention. The estimated WACC range was derived using the capital asset pricing
model (taking into consideration capitalization and market data for AV Homes and the other selected public companies referred to above), including a
size premium. Moelis noted that certain data underlying the WACC calculations was primarily based on data prior to the enactment of federal tax
legislation in December 2017. In performing the DCF analysis of AV Homes, Moelis used a range of estimated terminal values derived by applying a
range of multiples of 0.95x to 1.15x to AV Homes’ estimated real estate inventory value (excluding capitalized interest in inventory) at December 31,
2022, of $1,360 million. Moelis then derived an implied per share reference range from the resulting implied enterprise value reference range, assuming
net debt at June 30, 2018, of $375 million if the AV Homes Convertible Notes were out of the money and net debt of $295 million if the AV Homes
Convertible Notes were in the money and using the diluted share information described above. This analysis indicated the following implied per share
reference range for AV Homes, rounded to the nearest $0.05, as compared to the implied Merger Consideration:
 

Implied Per Share Reference Range  
Implied Merger
Consideration

$19.25-$29.20  $21.50

Moelis noted for the consideration of the AV Homes Board certain material limitations of its DCF analysis: (i) the limited trading volumes and
research coverage of the selected public companies, which make the beta, which is necessary to calculate WACC, less informative; (ii) the terminal
value represents approximately 104% of enterprise value, which implies that none of the DCF value is attributable to the interim cash flows during the
period covered by the Management Forecasts; and (iii) AV Homes’ financial forecasts for the outer years included in the Management Forecasts are
based on projects that AV Homes may not yet own or have identified.

Other Information

Moelis noted for the AV Homes Board the following additional factors that were not considered part of Moelis’ financial analyses with respect to
its opinion, but were referenced for informational purposes:
 

 
•  the historical closing trading prices for AV Homes Common Stock during the 52-week period ended June 5, 2018, which reflected low and

high stock prices during such period of $14.65 and $20.50 per share compared to the implied merger consideration of $21.50 per share;
 

 
•  the historical closing trading prices for AV Homes Common Stock during the five-year period ended June 5, 2018, which reflected low and

high stock prices during such period of $8.75 and $20.70 per share compared to the implied merger consideration of $21.50; and
 

 
•  a one-year forward stock price target for AV Homes Common Stock in a recently published, publicly available Wall Street research analyst’s

report, which indicated an undiscounted stock price target of $19.00 per share.

Miscellaneous

This summary of the analyses is not a complete description of Moelis’ opinion or the analyses underlying, and factors considered in connection
with, Moelis’ opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex analytical process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or
summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an
incomplete view of the processes underlying Moelis’ opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Moelis considered the results of all of its analyses
and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis. Rather, Moelis made its fairness determination on the basis of its experience and
professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses.

No company or transaction used in the analyses described above is identical to AV Homes, Taylor Morrison or the Merger. In addition, such
analyses do not purport to be appraisals, nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities may actually be sold. Analyses based
upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested
by such analyses. Because the analyses described above are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the
control of the parties or their respective advisors, neither AV Homes, nor Moelis or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are
materially different from those forecast.

The merger consideration was determined through arms’ length negotiations between AV Homes and Taylor Morrison and was approved by the
AV Homes Board. Moelis did not recommend any specific consideration to AV Homes or the AV Homes Board, or that any specific amount or type of
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.

Pursuant to the engagement letter dated February 19, 2018, Moelis acted as financial advisor to the AV Homes Board in connection with the
Merger. Moelis received a retainer of $175,000 upon execution of the engagement letter, which will be credited against its transaction fee, and will
receive a fee for its services estimated to be $6,100,000, $1,000,000 of which became payable in connection with the delivery of its opinion, regardless
of the conclusion reached therein, and the remainder of which is contingent upon completion of the Merger. Furthermore, AV Homes has agreed to
reimburse Moelis for certain expenses and to indemnify Moelis for certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws, arising out of
its engagement.

Moelis’ affiliates, employees, officers and partners may at any time own securities (long or short) of AV Homes and Taylor Morrison. Moelis has
provided investment banking and other services to AV Homes unrelated to the Merger and in the future may provide such services to AV Homes and has
received and may receive compensation for such services.

The AV Homes Board selected Moelis as its financial advisor in connection with the Merger because Moelis has substantial experience in similar
transactions and familiarity with AV Homes. Moelis is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers
and acquisitions, strategic transactions, corporate restructurings, and valuations for corporate and other purposes.

Unaudited Projected Financial Information

AV Homes’ senior management does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future performance or earnings beyond the current
fiscal year due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of the underlying assumptions and estimates. AV Homes is
especially reluctant to disclose projections for extended periods due to the increasing uncertainty, unpredictability and subjectivity of such assumptions
and estimates when applied to time periods further in the future. However, in connection with its evaluation of a potential transaction AV Homes
management prepared financial projections for fiscal years 2018-2022, including projections provided by management of AV Homes, adjusted by AV
Homes management on June 5, 2018, to reflect updated information regarding AV Homes’ estimated cash balance at June 30, 2018,

and projected real estate inventory spend for the second half of 2018. These projections were made available to the AV Homes Board in connection with
its consideration and evaluation of the Merger and to AV Homes’ financial advisors in connection with their financial analyses and opinions.

A summary of these projections (the “Projections”) is included below solely because it was among the financial information made available to our
financial advisors for use in connection with their financial analyses and opinions. The inclusion of these Projections in this joint proxy statement /
prospectus should not be regarded as an indication that any of AV Homes, Taylor Morrison or their respective affiliates, advisors or representatives
considered the Projections to be predictive of actual future events, and the Projections should not be relied upon as such. None of AV Homes, Taylor
Morrison or their respective affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners or representatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not
differ from these Projections, and none of them undertake any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile these Projections to reflect
circumstances existing after the date the Projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the
assumptions underlying the Projections are shown to be in error, in each case, except as may be required under applicable law. AV Homes advised the
recipients of the Projections that its internal financial forecasts upon which the Projections were based are subjective in many respects. While presented
with numerical specificity, these Projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions known to AV Homes at the time of preparation. These
variables and assumptions are inherently uncertain and many are beyond the control of AV Homes. Important factors that may affect actual results and
cause these internal financial forecasts to not be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to AV Homes’ business
(including its ability to achieve strategic goals, objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, the regulatory and competitive
environment, changes in technology and consumer preferences, general business and economic conditions and other factors described or referenced
under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Various assumptions underlying the Projections may not
prove to have been, or may no longer be, accurate. The Projections may not be realized, and actual results may be significantly higher or lower than
projected in the Projections. The Projections summarized below do not give effect to the combination. The Projections also reflect assumptions as to
certain business strategies or plans that are subject to change. The Projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the
date they were prepared. The Projections cover multiple years, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. As
a result, the inclusion of the Projections in this proxy statement/prospectus should not be relied on as necessarily predictive of actual future events and
actual results may differ materially (and will differ materially if the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are
completed) from the Projections. For all of these reasons, the internal financial forecasts, and the assumptions upon which they are based, (i) are not
guarantees of future results, (ii) are inherently speculative, and (iii) are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. As a result, actual results may
differ materially from those contained in these internal financial forecasts. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Projections will be realized.

The Projections were prepared for internal use and to assist AV Homes’ financial advisors with their financial analyses and opinions and the AV
Homes Board with its consideration and evaluation of the merger, and although they were prepared on an accounting basis consistent with AV Homes’
financial statements, they were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward complying with the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. The Projections included herein have
been prepared by or at the direction of, and are the responsibility of, AV Homes and in the view of AV Homes management, were prepared on a
reasonable basis and reflect the best available estimates and judgments at the time they were prepared. Neither the Company’s independent auditors, nor
any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the projection information contained herein,
nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and
disclaim any association with, the projection information. The Deloitte & Touche LLP report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to
AV Homes’ historical financial information. It does not extend to the Projections and should not be read to do so.

For the foregoing reasons, as well as the basis and assumptions on which the Projections were compiled, the inclusion of specific portions of the
Projections in this proxy statement should not be regarded as an indication that such Projections will be an accurate prediction of future events, and they
should not be relied on as such. This summary of these internal financial forecasts is not being included in this proxy statement / prospectus to influence
your decision whether to vote in favor of any proposal, but because these internal financial forecasts were considered by the AV Homes Board and its
financial advisors for the purposes of evaluating this transaction. Except as required by applicable securities laws, AV Homes does not intend to update,
or otherwise revise the Projections or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the date when made or to reflect the
occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error. Therefore, readers of this proxy statement are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on the specific portions of the Projections set forth below.

AV Homes does not intend to make publicly available any update or other revision to these Projections. None of AV Homes or its respective
affiliates, advisors, officers, directors, partners or representatives has made, makes or is authorized in the future to make any representation to any
shareholder or other person regarding AV Homes’ ultimate performance compared to the information contained in these Projections or that forecasts
results will be achieved, and any statements to the contrary should be disregarded. AV Homes has made no representation to Taylor Morrison, in the
merger agreement or otherwise, concerning these Projections.

The following is a summary of the Projections (dollars in millions):

Interests of Certain AV Homes Directors and Officers in the Merger

In considering the recommendations of the AV Homes Board with respect to the Merger, AV Homes stockholders should be aware that AV
Homes’ directors and executive officers have certain interests, including financial interests, in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
the interests of AV Homes stockholders generally. The AV Homes Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in
approving the Merger Agreement, and in making its recommendation that AV Homes stockholders approve the Merger. See the sections entitled
“Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—Background of the Merger” and “Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement—AV Homes’ Reasons
for the Merger; Recommendation of the AV Homes Board of Directors.” These interests are described in more detail below, and certain of them are
quantified in the narrative and the table below.

Treatment of AV Homes Equity Awards

AV Homes Options. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding option to purchase shares of AV Homes Common Stock will be
converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration (before giving effect to any
proration adjustment) over the exercise price per share of such option and (ii) the number of shares subject to such option.

AV Homes Restricted Stock Awards. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding AV Homes restricted stock award will be substituted
with a Taylor Morrison restricted stock award corresponding to a number of whole shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock (rounded to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock subject to the AV Homes restricted stock award (assuming
that any performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such award are fully achieved) and (ii) the Stock Consideration (before giving effect to any
proration adjustment). Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, each Taylor Morrison restricted stock award will continue to have the
same vesting and acceleration of vesting terms and conditions (other than any performance-based vesting conditions) as, and other terms and conditions
that are substantially similar to, those that applied to the corresponding AV Homes restricted stock award. If the holder of a Taylor Morrison restricted
stock award experiences a termination without cause or resigns with good reason, in each case, within 24 months following a change in control
(including the Merger) (referred to as a “qualifying termination”), the Taylor Morrison restricted stock award will fully vest.

AV Homes RSU Awards. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of AV Homes
Common Stock (referred to as an “AV Homes RSU award”) that is held by an employee of AV Homes or its subsidiaries will be substituted with a
Taylor Morrison restricted stock unit corresponding to a number of whole shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole
share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock subject to the AV Homes award (assuming that any performance-
based vesting conditions applicable to such award are achieved at target levels) and (ii) the Stock Consideration (before giving effect to any proration
adjustment). Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, each Taylor Morrison restricted stock unit as applicable, will continue to have
the same vesting and acceleration of vesting terms and conditions (other than any performance-based vesting conditions) as, and other terms and
conditions that are substantially similar to, those that applied to the corresponding AV Homes RSU award. If the holder of a Taylor Morrison restricted
stock unit experiences a qualifying termination, the Taylor Morrison award will fully vest.

At the effective time of the Merger, each AV Homes RSU award held by a non-employee director of AV Homes will be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration (before giving effect to any proration adjustment) in respect of each share of AV Homes Common Stock underlying such
award.

Quantification of Payments. For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of AV Homes’ named executive officers on settlement
of their unvested AV Homes equity awards, see “—Quantification of Payments and Benefits to AV Homes’ Named Executive Officers” below. We
estimate that the aggregate amount that would be payable to AV Homes’ six non-employee directors who are eligible for equity grants for their unvested
AV Homes equity awards if the effective time occurred on July 9, 2018 is $2,408,227. The amounts specified in this paragraph are determined using a
price per share of AV Homes Common Stock of $21.44, the average closing price per share over the first five business days following the announcement
of the Merger Agreement.

Employment Agreements with Named Executive Officers

Each of AV Homes’ named executive officers is a party to an employment agreement with AV Homes that provides for enhanced severance
benefits in the event of a qualifying termination. The employment agreements provide that, upon a qualifying termination, the officer will be entitled to:
 

 
•  continuation of the officer’s annual base salary for 24 months (36 months, in the case of Roger A. Cregg, the Company’s President and

Chief Executive Officer), payable in installments in accordance with AV Homes’ normal payroll practices;
 

 •  a lump sum cash payment equal to two times (three times, in the case of Mr. Cregg) the officer’s target annual bonus;
 

 •  full vesting of any outstanding equity awards; and
 

 •  continued health insurance benefits for 24 months (36 months, in the case of Mr. Cregg).

Payments and benefits under the employment agreement are subject to the officer’s execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in
favor of AV Homes. Each of the employment agreements also provides that, if any payments or benefits due to the officer become subject to the excise
tax under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, the payments and benefits will be reduced such that no payments or benefits are subject to the excise
tax, unless the officer would be better off on an after-tax basis receiving all such payments and benefits.

The employment agreements include restrictive covenants in favor of AV Homes, including 12-month (24-month, in the case of Mr. Cregg) post-
termination restrictions on competitive activities and on solicitation of AV Homes customers and employees, as well as customary confidentiality and
nondisparagement covenants of perpetual duration.

In connection with its execution of the Merger Agreement, Taylor Morrison entered into a letter agreement with each of the AV Homes named
executive officers under which Taylor Morrison acknowledged that each officer will have good reason to resign upon consummation of the Merger and
receive the enhanced severance benefits described above. In addition, under the letter agreement, each officer agreed that, if requested no later than ten
days prior to the effective time of the Merger, the officer would provide post-closing integration services to Taylor Morrison as a consultant on terms
reasonably acceptable to the parties, including (i) a monthly consulting fee at the rate that would have been paid as base salary had the officer’s
employment continued following the consummation of the Merger, and (ii) a one-month term of service, renewable for up to a total term of three
months.

For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would be payable to AV Homes’ named executive officers upon a
qualifying termination in connection with the Merger, see “—Quantification of Payments and Benefits to AV Homes’ Named Executive Officers” below.

Indemnification; Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance

AV Homes is party to indemnification agreements with each of its directors and executive officers that require AV Homes, among other things, to
indemnify the directors and executive officers against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, from and after the effective time of the Merger, Taylor Morrison will be obligated to cause the Surviving
Corporation to indemnify certain persons, including AV Homes’ directors and executive officers. In addition, for a period of not less than six years from
the effective time of the Merger, AV Homes will maintain an insurance and indemnification policy for the benefit of certain persons, including AV
Homes’ directors and executive officers. For additional information, see “The Merger Agreement—Other Covenants and Agreements.”

Quantification of Payments and Benefits to AV Homes’ Named Executive Officers

The table below sets forth the amount of payments and benefits that each of AV Homes’ named executive officers would receive in connection
with the Merger, assuming that the Merger were consummated and each such named executive officer experienced a qualifying termination on July 9,
2018. The amounts below are determined using a price per share of AV Homes Common Stock of $21.44, the average closing price per share of AV
Homes Common Stock over the first five business days following the announcement of the Merger Agreement, and are based on multiple other
assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described in the footnotes to the table. As
a result of the foregoing assumptions, the actual amounts, if any, to be received by a named executive officer may materially differ from the amounts set
forth below.

(1) The cash payments payable to each named executive officer consist of a severance payment equal to the sum of (a) 24 months (36 months, in the

case of Mr. Cregg) of base salary (which amount is payable in installments in accordance with AV Homes’ normal payroll practices) and (b) two
times (three times, in the case of Mr. Cregg) the officer’s target annual bonus (which amount is payable in a lump sum). The severance payments
are “double-trigger” (i.e., payable upon a qualifying termination following the occurrence of a change in control).

(2) As described above, all unvested AV Homes options will be settled as of the effective time of the Merger, and all unvested AV Homes restricted
stock awards and AV Homes RSU awards will be converted into substantially similar Taylor Morrison awards and continue to vest in accordance
with their ordinary schedules, or if earlier, upon a qualifying termination following the Merger. The vesting of AV Homes options is “single-
trigger” (i.e., payable upon the occurrence of a change in control), while the vesting of AV Homes restricted stock awards and AV Homes RSU
awards is “double-trigger.” Set forth below are the values of each type of unvested equity-based award that would be payable upon the effective
time of the Merger, based on a price per share of AV Homes Common Stock of $21.44, assuming applicable performance criteria with respect to
performance-based AV Homes restricted stock awards are fully satisfied, applicable performance criteria with respect to performance-based AV
Homes RSU awards are achieved at target levels, and less the applicable exercise price in the case of unvested AV Homes options.

Board of Directors and Management Following the Merger

The board of directors and executive officers of Taylor Morison are not expected to change as a result of the consummation of the Merger. For
information on Taylor Morrison’s current directors and executive officers, please see Taylor Morrison’s proxy statement for its 2018 annual meeting of
stockholders filed with the SEC on May 11, 2018 and its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July  19, 2018. See “Where You Can Find
More Information.”

Treatment of AV Homes Convertible Notes

The Merger constitutes a “Fundamental Change” for purposes of the indenture governing the AV Homes Convertible Notes. Upon the occurrence
of a Fundamental Change, the holders of the AV Homes Convertible Notes can cause AV Homes (or its successor) to repurchase the AV Homes
Convertible Notes at a price equal to 100% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of
repurchase.

Holders of the AV Homes Convertible Notes may also convert them at an increased conversion rate in connection with the Merger, and if such
conversion occurs with respect to all of the AV Homes Convertible Notes, such holders would be entitled to the Merger Consideration that would be
paid to holders of a total of approximately 4.4 million shares of AV Homes Common Stock. The form of such Merger Consideration would be the form
elected by holders of a plurality of the AV Homes Common Stock. Such Merger Consideration would consist of (i) an aggregate of approximately
$95.0 million in cash if holders of a plurality of AV Homes Common Stock elect to receive all of the Merger Consideration in cash, (ii) an aggregate of
approximately 4.3 million shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock if holders of a plurality of such AV Homes Common Stock elect to receive all of
the Merger Consideration in Taylor Morrison Common Stock and (iii) an aggregate of approximately $55.8 million in cash and approximately
1.8 million shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock if holders of a plurality of such AV Homes Common Stock elect to receive mixed cash and stock
consideration. The combined company expects to fund any required additional cash payments from additional borrowings under its revolving credit
facility.

The consideration deliverable upon conversion of AV Homes Convertible Notes as described in the preceding paragraph assumes that the Merger
closes on October 1, 2018, and the average closing price of the AV Homes Common Stock on the last five trading days preceding the closing date is
$21.50. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the AV Homes Convertible Notes, the number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the AV Homes Convertible Notes will vary based on the date of closing of the Merger and such average closing price. Any AV
Homes Convertible Notes that are not repurchased or converted will remain outstanding.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

each case, as defined below) of AV Homes Common Stock whose shares of

common stock are converted into the right to receive Taylor Morrison Common Stock and/or cash in the Merger. This summary is based on the current
provisions of the Code, applicable Treasury Regulations, judicial authority, and administrative rulings, all of which are subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. Any such change could alter the tax consequences to the holders as described herein. This summary is general in nature and does not
purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects of the Merger. For example, it does not consider the effect of the Medicare tax on net
investment income, federal alternative minimum tax, or any applicable state, local or non-U.S. income tax laws, or federal estate and gift taxes or other
non-income tax laws. Furthermore, this summary applies only to holders that hold their AV Homes Common Stock as “capital assets” within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal
income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of the holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as:
 

 •  a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution;
 

 •  a tax-exempt organization;
 

 •  a retirement plan or other tax-deferred account;
 

 
•  an entity or arrangement treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership, S corporation or other pass-through entity (or an

investor in such an entity or arrangement);
 

 •  a mutual fund;
 

 •  a real estate investment trust or regulated investment company;
 

 •  a dealer or broker in stocks and securities or currencies;
 

 •  a trader in securities that elects mark-to-market treatment;
 

 
•  a holder of shares that received the shares through the exercise of an employee stock option, through a tax qualified retirement plan or

otherwise as compensation;
 

 •  a holder that has a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar;
 

 
•  a “controlled foreign corporation,” “passive foreign investment company,” or corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid U.S. federal

income tax;
 

 •  a person that is required to report income no later than when such income is reported on an “applicable financial statement”;
 

 •  a holder that holds shares as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated transaction; or
 

 •  a U.S. expatriate.

If an entity that is classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds AV Homes Common Stock, the U.S. federal income tax
treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding AV Homes Common
Stock and partners in such partnerships are urged consult their tax advisors as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to
them.

For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of AV Homes Common Stock that is:
 

 •  an individual citizen or resident of the United States as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes;
 

 
•  a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the

United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury
regulations to be treated as a United States person.

A “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of AV Homes Common Stock that is not a U.S. holder or a partnership (or any other entity
classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes).

U.S. Holders

Consequences of the Merger Generally

The receipt of cash, Taylor Morrison Common Stock or both in the Merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In general, a U.S. holder that receives cash, Taylor Morrison Common Stock or both in the Merger will recognize gain or loss equal to the
difference, if any, between (1) the sum of the amount of cash (including any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock
received in the Merger) and the fair market value of Taylor Morrison Common Stock received and (2) such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in its shares
of AV Homes Common Stock exchanged. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in AV Homes Common Stock generally will equal the price the U.S. holder
paid for such shares. Gain or loss and the holding period will be determined separately for each block of shares of AV Homes Common Stock (i.e.,
shares of AV Homes Common Stock acquired at the same cost in a single transaction). Such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and generally will be
treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the shares of AV Homes Common Stock for more than one year at the effective time
of the Merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations.

A U.S. holder’s aggregate tax basis in its Taylor Morrison Common Stock received in the merger will equal the fair market value of such shares at
the effective time of the Merger, and the U.S. holder’s holding period for such shares will begin on the day after the Merger.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to payments made in connection with the Merger. Backup withholding will not apply,
however, to a holder of AV Homes Common Stock that (1) furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number, certifies that such holder is not subject to
backup withholding on IRS Form W-9 (or appropriate successor form), and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup
withholding rules; or (2) provides proof that such holder is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and
any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a holder’s United States federal income tax liability, if
any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a timely manner. The IRS may impose a penalty upon any taxpayer that
fails to provide the correct taxpayer identification number.

Non-U.S. Holders

Consequences of the Merger Generally

A non-U.S. holder’s receipt of cash, Taylor Morrison Common Stock or both in exchange for shares of AV Homes Common Stock pursuant to the
merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
 

 
•  the gain, if any, on such shares is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in the United States (and, if required

by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to the non-U.S. holder’s permanent establishment in the United States);

Table of Contents

 
•  the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the exchange of shares of

AV Homes Common Stock for cash and/or Taylor Morrison Common Stock pursuant to the Merger and certain other conditions are met; or
 

 

•  AV Homes is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of the Code (a
“USRPHC”), during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Merger and the non-U.S. holder’s holding period in the AV Homes
common stock; provided, that so long as the AV Homes Common Stock is regularly traded on an established securities market, a non-U.S.
holder generally would be subject to taxation only if at any time during the five-year or shorter period, such non-U.S. holder owned more
than 5%, directly or by attribution, of AV Homes common stock.

A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will generally be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax on any gain
realized as if the non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder, as described above. If such non-U.S. holder is a corporation, it may also be subject to a branch
profits tax imposed at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) on its effectively connected earnings and profits. A non-U.S. holder described in the second
bullet point immediately above will be subject to tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower treaty rate) on any gain realized, which may be offset by U.S.-source
capital losses recognized in the same taxable year, even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States.

United States real property holding company

AV Homes believes that it is, and has been at points during the five-year period described above, a USRPHC. Accordingly, the exchange of AV
Homes Common Stock for cash in the Merger by a non-U.S. holder will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S.
persons (except that the branch profits tax will not apply); provided, that, so long as AV Homes Common Stock is regularly traded on an established
securities market, AV Homes’ treatment as a USRPHC would cause only a non-U.S. holder who holds or held, directly or by attribution, more than 5%
of AV Homes Common Stock (at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Merger or the period that the non-U.S. holder held AV
Homes common stock), and is not eligible for a treaty exemption.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Information reporting and backup withholding will generally apply to payments made pursuant to the Merger to a non-U.S. holder effected by or
through the U.S. office of any broker, U.S. or foreign, unless the holder certifies its status as a non-U.S. holder and satisfies certain other requirements,
or otherwise establishes an exemption. Copies of applicable information returns reporting such payments and any withholding may also be made
available to the tax authorities in the non-U.S. holder’s country in which such holder resides under the provisions of an applicable treaty or agreement.
Generally, information reporting and backup withholding will not apply to a payment of disposition proceeds to a non-U.S. holder where the transaction
is effected outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a broker. However, for information reporting purposes, dispositions effected through a
non-U.S. office of a U.S. broker or a non-U.S. broker with substantial U.S. ownership or operations generally will be treated in a manner similar to
dispositions effected through a U.S. office of a broker.

A non-U.S. holder must generally submit an IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or other applicable IRS Form W-8) attesting to its
exempt foreign status in order to qualify as an exempt recipient. Notwithstanding the foregoing, backup withholding and information reporting may
apply if we, the paying agent or Taylor Morrison has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that a non-U.S. holder is a U.S. person. Backup withholding
is not an additional tax. Rather, any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a non-U.S. holder can be refunded or
credited against the non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any; provided, that an appropriate claim is timely filed with the IRS.

Consequences of holding Taylor Morrison Common Stock for non-U.S. holders

Dividends

Distributions of cash or property that are paid in respect of Taylor Morrison Common Stock will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax
purposes to the extent paid from current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). Except as
described below under “—Effectively Connected Income,” a non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate, or
at a reduced rate prescribed by an applicable income tax treaty, on any dividends received in respect in respect of Taylor Morrison Common Stock. If the
amount of the distribution exceeds Taylor Morrison’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, such excess first will be treated as a return of capital
to the extent of the non-U.S. holder’s tax basis in Taylor Morrison Common Stock, and thereafter will be treated as capital gain. However, except to the
extent that we elect (or the paying agent or other intermediary through which a non-U.S. holder holds Taylor Morrison Common Stock elects) otherwise,
we (or the intermediary) must generally withhold on the entire distribution, in which case the non-U.S. holder would be entitled to a refund from the IRS
for the withholding tax on the portion of the distribution that exceeded our current and accumulated earnings and profits. In order to obtain a reduced
rate of U.S. federal withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty, a non-U.S. holder will be required to provide a properly executed IRS Form
W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E (or successor form) certifying such stockholder’s entitlement to benefits under the treaty. If a non-U.S. holder is eligible
for a reduced rate of U.S. federal withholding tax under an income tax treaty, the non-U.S. holder may obtain a refund or credit of any excess amounts
withheld by filing an appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding possible
entitlement to benefits under an income tax treaty.

Gain on disposition of Taylor Morrison Common Stock

Subject to the discussion below under “Information reporting and backup withholding” and “FATCA,” the consequences to a non-U.S. holder on
the disposition of Taylor Morrison Common Stock will generally be the same as discussed above in “Non-U.S. Holders—Consequences of the Merger
Generally.”

Effectively connected income

If a dividend received on Taylor Morrison Common Stock, or gain from a sale or other taxable disposition of Taylor Morrison Common Stock, is
treated as effectively connected with a non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax
treaty, is attributable to such non-U.S. holder’s U.S. permanent establishment), such non-U.S. holder will generally be exempt from withholding tax on
any such dividend and any gain realized on such a disposition, provided such non-U.S. holder complies with certain certification requirements
(generally on IRS Form W-8ECI). Instead, such non-U.S. holder will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis on any such
gains or dividends in the same manner as if such holder were a U.S. person (as defined in the Code) unless an applicable income tax treaty provides
otherwise. In addition, a non-U.S. holder that is a foreign corporation may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate provided by
an applicable income tax treaty) on such holder’s earnings and profits for the taxable year that are effectively connected with such holder’s conduct of a
trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to such holder’s U.S. permanent
establishment), subject to adjustments.

Information reporting and backup withholding

Generally, we must report to our non-U.S. holders and the IRS the amount of dividends paid during each calendar year, if any, and the amount of
any tax withheld. These information reporting requirements apply even if no withholding is required (e.g., because the distributions are effectively
connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a United States trade or business, or withholding is eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty). This
information may also be made available under a specific treaty or agreement with the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides
or is established.

Backup withholding, however, generally will not apply to distributions payable to a non-U.S. holder of shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock
provided the non-U.S. holder furnishes to us or our paying agent the required certification as to its non-U.S. status, such as by providing a valid IRS
Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8ECI, or certain other requirements are met. Notwithstanding the foregoing, backup withholding may
apply if either we or our paying agent has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the non-U.S. holder is a U.S. person (as defined in the Code) that is
not an exempt recipient.

Payments on the sale or other taxable disposition of Taylor Morrison Common Stock made to or through a foreign office of a foreign broker
generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting. However, if such broker is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes: a U.S.
person, a controlled foreign corporation, a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business for
a specified three-year period or a foreign partnership with certain connections to the United States, then information reporting will be required unless the
broker has in its records documentary evidence that the non-U.S. holder is not a U.S. person (as defined in the Code) and certain other conditions are
met or the non-U.S. holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Backup withholding may apply to any payment that such broker is required to report if
the broker has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the payee is a U.S. person. Payments to or through the U.S. office of a broker will be subject to
backup withholding and information reporting unless the non-U.S. holder certifies, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a U.S. person, or otherwise
establishes an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax but merely an advance payment, which may be credited against a non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal
income tax liability or refunded to the extent it results in an overpayment of tax and the appropriate information is timely supplied by the non-U.S.
holder to the IRS.

FATCA

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and related U.S. Treasury guidance commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act, or FATCA, foreign financial institutions (which include most foreign hedge funds, private equity funds, mutual funds, securitization
vehicles and any other investment vehicles) and certain other foreign entities generally must comply with information reporting rules and due diligence
requirements with respect to their U.S. account holders and investors or be subject to a withholding tax on U.S.-source payments made to them (whether
received as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary for another party). More specifically, a foreign financial institution or other foreign entity that does
not comply with the FATCA reporting requirements and due diligence will generally be subject to a 30% withholding tax with respect to any
“withholdable payments.” For this purpose, withholdable payments generally include U.S.-source payments otherwise subject to nonresident
withholding tax (e.g., U.S.-source dividends) and also include the entire gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of any equity or debt
instruments of U.S. issuers. The FATCA withholding tax will apply even if the payment would otherwise not be subject to U.S. nonresident withholding
tax (e.g., because it is capital gain). Administrative guidance from the IRS defers this withholding obligation for gross proceeds from dispositions of
U.S. common stock until January 1, 2019.

Non-U.S. holders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of the FATCA provisions to them based on their
particular circumstances.

THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. WE URGE YOU TO CONSULT WITH YOUR TAX
ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, AS
WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER ARISING UNDER THE FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX RULES OR UNDER
THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, FOREIGN OR OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.

Consequences to Taylor Morrison, AV Homes, and Merger Sub

None of Taylor Morrison, AV Homes, or Merger Sub will recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the
Merger.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger

In accordance with GAAP, Taylor Morrison will account for the Merger using the acquisition method of accounting, with Taylor Morrison being
considered the acquirer of AV Homes for accounting purposes. This means that Taylor Morrison will allocate the purchase price to the fair value of AV
Homes tangible and intangible assets and liabilities at the acquisition date, with the excess purchase price, if any, being recorded as goodwill. Under the
acquisition method of accounting, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. The operating results of AV Homes will be
reported as part of the combined company beginning on the closing date of the Merger. The final valuation of the tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been completed. The completion of the valuation upon consummation of the Merger could result in
significantly different amortization expenses and balance sheet classifications than those presented in Taylor Morrison’s unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial information included in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Regulatory Approvals Required to Complete the Merger

Taylor Morrison has determined that the Merger is exempt from the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
(the “HSR Act”), as amended. At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the fact that Taylor Morrison has determined
the Merger to be exempt from the requirements of the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, or
any state, could take such action under antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including seeking to enjoin the completion
of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Taylor Morrison or AV Homes. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under
antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

No other governmental consents to the Merger are required. The Merger may require that notifications be given to governmental agencies that
have issued licenses that are held by AV Homes and its subsidiaries, and other governmental agencies. The shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock
that will be issued to AV Homes stockholders as a result of the Merger must be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance.

Litigation Relating to the Merger

Two purported class action complaints related to the Merger have been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on
behalf of putative classes of AV Homes’ public shareholders. The two complaints are captioned: Franchi v. AV Homes, Inc., Case No. 18 Civ. 01161,
which was filed on August 3, 2018; and Zucker v. AV Homes, Inc., et al., No. 18 Civ. 01091, which was filed on July 24, 2018. Both complaints name as
defendants AV Homes and its directors, as well as Taylor Morrison, and the Franchi complaint also names Intermediate Parent and Merger Sub as
defendants. The complaints generally allege that AV Homes and its directors and Taylor Morrison violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose
material information in the version of this proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on July 13, 2018. The Franchi complaint also alleges that the
omissions constitute violations of federal securities laws by Intermediate Parent and Merger Sub. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive
relief preventing the consummation of the Merger, damages, and an award of plaintiffs’ expenses and attorneys’ fees. The defendants believe that the
claims respectively asserted against them are wholly without merit.

Table of Contents

Exchange of Shares in the Merger

As a result of the Merger, each share of AV Homes Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger (other than the
Excluded Shares) will be converted into the right to receive either (i) the Cash Consideration, (ii) the Stock Consideration, or (iii) the Mixed
Consideration, at the election of the holder of each such share of AV Homes Common Stock. An election to receive either the Cash Consideration or
Stock Consideration is subject to the allocation and proration procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement, which are described in the section entitled
“The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration.” AV Homes stockholders who make no election or an untimely election, or are otherwise deemed not
to have submitted an effective form of election, will be deemed to have elected to receive the Mixed Consideration.

The Canceled Shares will be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

AV Homes stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share of Taylor Morrison Common Stock will receive cash in lieu
of such fractional share, and will not be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of such fractional share.

The precise consideration that an AV Homes stockholder will receive will not be known at the time that an election is made and, depending on the
determination of the election deadline, may not be known at the time of the AV Homes special meeting, because such consideration is dependent upon
the aggregate number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock in respect of which elections to receive the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration
are made.

Neither AV Homes nor Taylor Morrison is making any recommendation as to whether an AV Homes stockholder should elect to receive
the Cash Consideration or the Stock Consideration or the Mixed Consideration. If you are an AV Homes stockholder, you must make your own
decision with respect to this election and you should seek the advice of your own attorneys, financial advisors and/or accountants.

Dividends and Share Repurchases

Neither Taylor Morrison nor AV Homes currently pays a quarterly dividend on their respective capital stock. Under the terms of the Merger
Agreement, until the effective time of the Merger, neither Taylor Morrison nor AV Homes is permitted to declare, set aside, make or pay any dividend or
other distribution (whether payable in cash, stock, property or a combination thereof) with respect to any of its capital stock or other equity interests,
subject to certain exceptions, including, in the case of AV Homes, dividends paid by a wholly owned subsidiary to AV Homes or another wholly owned
subsidiary of AV Homes and, in the case of Taylor Morrison, issuances of awards under, or modifications to, the Taylor Morrison equity plans, including
existing awards thereunder.

Listing of Shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock and Delisting and Deregistration of AV Homes Common Stock

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Taylor Morrison is required to use reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Taylor Morrison
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE prior to the effective time of the Merger, subject to official notice of
issuance. Accordingly, application will be made to have the shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock to be issued in the Merger approved for listing on
the NYSE, where shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock are currently listed for trading under the ticker symbol “TMHC.”

If the Merger is completed, there will no longer be any publicly held shares of AV Homes Common Stock. Accordingly, AV Homes Common
Stock will no longer be listed on Nasdaq and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Appraisal Rights

Under Delaware law, record holders of AV Homes Common Stock who neither vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement nor consent
thereto in writing, who continuously hold their shares of AV Homes Common Stock through the effective time of the Merger and who otherwise comply
with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger, and if the Merger is
completed, subject to the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, obtain payment in cash of the fair value of their shares of AV Homes Common Stock
as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, instead of receiving the Merger Consideration for their shares. Under Section 262 of the DGCL,
assuming AV Homes Common Stock remains listed on a national securities exchange immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, the
Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss any appraisal proceedings as to all stockholders who have perfected their appraisal rights unless (i) the total
number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of AV Homes Common Stock, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided
in the Merger for such total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds $1 million. To exercise appraisal rights, AV Homes stockholders must comply
with the procedures prescribed by Section 262 of the DGCL. These procedures are summarized under “Appraisal Rights” in this proxy
statement/prospectus. In addition, a copy of the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL is included as Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus. Failure
to comply with these provisions may result in a loss of the right of appraisal.

Corporate Headquarters

Taylor Morrison’s principal executive offices are located at 4900 N. Scottsdale Road, Suite 2000, Scottsdale, Arizona 85251 and its telephone

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following section summarizes material provisions of the Merger Agreement, which is included in this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex
A, is incorporated by reference herein, and qualifies the following summary in its entirety. The rights and obligations of Taylor Morrison, Intermediate
Parent, Merger Sub, and AV Homes, as parties to the Merger Agreement, are governed by the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other
information contained in or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. AV Homes stockholders are urged to read the Merger
Agreement carefully and in its entirety, as well as this proxy statement/prospectus and the information incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus, before making any decisions regarding the proposals.

The following summary of the Merger Agreement is included in this proxy statement/prospectus to provide you with information regarding the
terms of the Merger Agreement and is not intended to provide any factual information about Taylor Morrison or AV Homes. Such information can be
found elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and in the other public filings Taylor Morrison and AV Homes, respectively, have made and will
make with the SEC. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”

The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties and covenants by AV Homes, Taylor Morrison and Merger Sub. These
representations and warranties have been made by AV Homes solely for the benefit of Taylor Morrison, on the one hand, and by Taylor Morrison and
Merger Sub, solely for the benefit of AV Homes, on the other hand, and:
 

 
•  may not be intended as statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating risk between Taylor Morrison and AV Homes in the event the

statements therein prove to be inaccurate;
 

 
•  have been qualified in important respects by confidential disclosures that were exchanged between Taylor Morrison and AV Homes at the

time they entered into the Merger Agreement, which disclosures are not reflected in the Merger Agreement itself; and
 

 •  may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from the standard of materiality that is applicable to disclosures to investors.

Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement and described below may
have changed since the date of the Merger Agreement, and subsequent developments or new information qualifying a representation or warranty may
have been included in this proxy statement/prospectus. In addition, if specific material facts arise that contradict the representations and warranties in the
Merger Agreement, each of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes, as applicable, will disclose those material facts in public filings that it makes with the SEC
if it determines that it has a legal obligation to do so. Accordingly, the representations and warranties and other provisions of the Merger Agreement
should not be read alone, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and in the
documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”

Structure and Effect of the Merger

The Merger Agreement provides that Taylor Morrison will acquire AV Homes, Merger Sub’s separate corporate existence will cease and AV
Homes will no longer be a publicly traded company. Specifically, in the Merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into AV Homes, with AV Homes
surviving the Merger as an indirect subsidiary of Taylor Morrison (the “Surviving Corporation”).

From and after the effective time of the Merger, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of AV Homes and Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of AV Homes and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, as provided under the DGCL.

Table of Contents

From and after the effective time of the Merger, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger will become the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until changed or
amended as provided in such certificate of incorporation or bylaws and by applicable law, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the effective
time of the Merger will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, subject to his or her
earlier death, resignation or removal and the officers of AV Homes immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation until his or her successor has been elected and qualified, subject to his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.

Merger Consideration

At the effective time of the Merger, each share of AV Homes Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger, except for any shares (i) subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under an AV Homes equity plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, (ii) with respect to which appraisal rights have been properly demanded in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL, which will have the rights described in “Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement – Appraisal Rights,” or (iii) Canceled
Shares, (together with the shares described in clauses (i) and (ii), “Excluded Shares”), will be converted into the right to receive, (a) 0.9793 validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock (subject to the proration procedures described in this proxy
statement/prospectus), (b) $21.50 in cash (subject to the proration procedures described in this proxy statement/prospectus), or (c) $12.64 in cash,
without any interest thereon, and 0.4034 validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock; provided, that AV
Homes stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock (which we refer to as the “Fractional Shares”)
(we refer to each of the Stock Consideration, Cash Consideration and Mixed Consideration as Per Share Merger Consideration). As further described
below in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Election and Exchange Procedures,” and in more detail in the Merger Agreement, each AV
Homes stockholder will, until the election deadline, be entitled to elect to receive either Cash Consideration (which we refer to as a “Cash Election”),
Stock Consideration (which we refer to as a “Stock Election”), or Mixed Consideration (which we refer to as a “Mixed Election”), in exchange for each
share of AV Homes Common Stock held by him or her that was issued and outstanding immediately prior to the election deadline (other than any
Excluded Shares), subject to allocation and proration procedures described below and in further detail in the Merger Agreement. AV Homes
stockholders (other than in their capacity as holders of Excluded Shares) who make no election or an untimely election (or who otherwise are deemed
not to have submitted an effective form of election) will be deemed to have made a Mixed Election. The Exchange Agent has reasonable discretion to
determine whether a Stock Election, Cash Election or Mixed Election has been made or deemed made in respect of any shares of AV Homes Common
Stock. For more information regarding the election deadline, see the section entitled “The Merger Agreement—Election and Exchange Procedures.”

Stock Elections, Cash Elections and Mixed Elections are subject to the allocation and proration procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement to
ensure that the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration will consist of approximately 58.8% cash and approximately 41.2% Taylor Morrison
Common Stock.

Thus, proration may be applied in certain circumstances. If (i) the product of the Cash Electing Shares multiplied by the Cash Consideration
(before giving effect to any adjustment) (as defined above, the Cash Election Amount) exceeds (ii) (a) the Available Cash Election Amount, then the
following consideration will be paid in respect of each Cash Electing Share:
 

 

•  an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the Cash Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment) multiplied by (ii) the greater of
(a) a fraction, rounded to four (4) decimal places, the numerator of which is the Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of
which is the Cash Election Amount and (b) zero (0) (as defined above, we refer to the amount calculated in clause (ii) of this paragraph as
the Cash Fraction); and

•  a number of shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the Stock Consideration (before giving effect to any

adjustment) multiplied by (ii) the result of one (1) minus the Cash Fraction.

If the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then the following consideration will be paid in respect of each share
pursuant to which a Stock Election is made (the Stock Electing Shares):
 

 
•  an amount of cash equal to the result of (i) the amount of such excess divided by (ii) the number of Stock Electing Shares (the Prorated Cash

Amount); and
 

 

•  a number of shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the Stock Consideration (before giving effect to any
adjustment) multiplied by (ii) a fraction, rounded to four (4) decimal places, the numerator of which is the difference between (a) the Cash
Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment) and (b) the Prorated Cash Amount and the denominator of which is the Cash
Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment).

Election and Exchange Procedures

Taylor Morrison has selected Computershare Trust Company, N.A. to serve as the Exchange Agent to handle the exchange of shares of AV Homes
Common Stock for the Per Share Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any Dividend Consideration as described above.

Prior to the closing of the Merger, AV Homes will provide a form of election to holders of record of shares of AV Homes Common Stock (other
than holders of Excluded Shares) advising such holders of the procedure for exercising their right to make an election.

To be effective, a form of election must be properly completed, signed and submitted to the Exchange Agent by the election deadline. Unless
otherwise agreed in advance by AV Homes and Taylor Morrison, the “election deadline” is 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on the date that AV Homes
and Taylor Morrison agree is as near as practicable to two (2) business days preceding the closing date of the Merger. AV Homes stockholders are urged
to promptly submit their properly completed and signed forms of election, together with the necessary transmittal materials, and not wait until the
election deadline. Each form of election submitted to the Exchange Agent must be accompanied by:
 

 
•  the certificates, if any, to which such form of election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the

books of AV Homes (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates), and
 

 •  in the case of book-entry shares, any additional documents specified in the procedures set forth in the form of election.

Any AV Homes stockholder may revoke his or her Per Share Merger Consideration election before the election deadline by written notice that is
sent to and received by the Exchange Agent prior to the election deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised form of election or
by withdrawal prior to the election deadline of such AV Homes stockholder’s certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates), or any
documents in respect of book-entry shares previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. Any AV Homes stockholder who has validly revoked his or
her Per Share Merger Consideration election and has not properly submitted a new duly completed form of election will be deemed to have made a
Mixed Election. After an election is validly made, any subsequent transfer of shares shall automatically revoke such election. The Exchange Agent will
determine, in its reasonable discretion, whether forms of election have been properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked, and the decision of
the Exchange Agent in such matters will be conclusive and binding.

Table of Contents

Exchange Procedures

At or prior to the effective time of the Merger, Merger Sub will deposit with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of shares of Taylor Morrison
Common Stock in book-entry form equal to the aggregate number of shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock included in the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash included in the Per Share Merger Consideration Fractional
Share Consideration and any Dividend Consideration.

From and after the effective time of the Merger, there will be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of AV Homes of the shares of AV
Homes Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. If, after the effective time of the Merger, any
certificate of a share of AV Homes Common Stock is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it will be canceled and exchanged for the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any Dividend Consideration to which the holder of the certificate is
entitled pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Any portion of the exchange fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Exchange Agent that remains
unclaimed by the holders of certificates or book-entry shares on the first (1st) anniversary of the effective time of the Merger will be returned to the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not tendered his or her certificates or book-entry shares for the Per Share Merger
Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration (as defined below), as applicable, prior to such time shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) for delivery of the Per Share Merger Consideration,
Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, in each case without interest and subject to any withholding of taxes
required by applicable law, in respect of such holder’s surrender of his or her certificates or book-entry shares. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by the
holders immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any governmental entity will, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto. None of the Surviving Corporation, AV Homes, Merger Sub, Taylor Morrison or the Exchange Agent, or any employee, officer, director, agent
or affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any person in respect of any part of the amounts made available to the Exchange Agent that is delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

“Dividend Consideration” means dividends or other distributions with a record date after the effective time of the Merger with respect to shares of
Taylor Morrison Common Stock included in the applicable AV Homes stockholder’s Per Share Merger Consideration.

Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Shares

If a certificate for shares of AV Homes Common Stock has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then, before an AV Homes stockholder will be
entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (and Dividend Consideration, if applicable), such holder will need to make an affidavit
of that fact and, if requested by Merger Sub, post a bond as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Taylor Morrison, Merger
Sub, the surviving corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to such certificate.

Dissenting Shares

Shares of AV Homes Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and held by a holder who has neither voted
in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand, and has properly demanded, appraisal for such shares of AV
Homes Common Stock in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (we refer to such shares of AV Homes
Common Stock as the “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (and the Fractional Share
Consideration or Dividend Consideration, if applicable). At the effective

time of the Merger, all Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and cease to exist, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the rights
granted to them under the DGCL. If any such holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal
under Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable law, then such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the effective time of
the Merger, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (and the Fractional Share Consideration or
Dividend Consideration, if applicable), without interest and subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law.

Representations and Warranties

AV Homes, on the other hand, regarding, among other things:

facilitating any inquiries, proposals or offers relating to any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below)) or knowingly encourage the
submission or announcement of any inquiries, proposals or offers relating to any Acquisition Proposal or engage in any discussions or
negotiations with respect thereto (other than informing any third party of the existence of the provision contained in the Merger Agreement
with respect to solicitation), provided, however, that AV Homes may ascertain facts from any person, entity or group making an Acquisition
Proposal for the purpose of AV Homes Board informing itself about such Acquisition Proposal and the person, entity or group making it,

 

 •  approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal;
 

 

•  withhold, withdraw or rescind (or change or qualify, in a manner adverse to Taylor Morrison or Merger Sub), or publicly propose to

statement/prospectus;

 

 •  enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent or other similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal; or
 

 •  resolve or agree to do any of the actions described above.

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, if, prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval in connection with the Merger, AV
Homes receives from any person, entity or group an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the AV Homes Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with AV Homes’ financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal
(as defined and described below), then, subject to compliance with the Merger Agreement, AV Homes and any of its representatives will be permitted to
(i) furnish information with respect to AV Homes and its subsidiaries (including non-public information) to the third party making such Acquisition
Proposal, its representatives and potential sources of financing and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with the third party making such
Acquisition Proposal, its representatives and potential sources of financing regarding such Acquisition Proposal (subject to promptly and, in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours, notifying Taylor Morrison of the status and material details thereof (including copies of any written documentation that is
material to such Acquisition Proposal)).

An “Acquisition Proposal” means any offer or proposal made from a third party concerning (a) a merger, consolidation, or other business
combination transaction (including any single – or multi-step transaction) or series of related transactions involving AV Homes in which any person,
entity, or group (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) seeks to acquire beneficial ownership of equity interests representing 20% or more of
the voting power of AV Homes; (b) a sale, lease, license, mortgage, pledge or other disposition, directly or indirectly, by merger, consolidation, business
combination, share exchange, partnership, joint venture or otherwise, of assets of AV Homes (including equity interests of a subsidiary of AV Homes) or
the subsidiaries of AV Homes representing 20% or more of the consolidated assets of AV Homes and its subsidiaries based on their fair market value as
determined in good faith by the AV Homes Board, (c) an issuance or sale (including by way of merger, consolidation, business combination, share
exchange, joint venture or otherwise) of equity interests representing 20% or more of the voting power of AV Homes or a tender offer or exchange offer
in which any person, entity, or group (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) seeks to acquire beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire
beneficial ownership, of equity interests representing 20% or more of the voting power of AV Homes, or (d) any combination of the foregoing (in each
case, other than the Merger).

A “Superior Proposal” means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (except the references therein to “20%” shall be replaced by “50%”), made
by a third party which, in the good faith judgment of the AV Homes Board (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel),
taking into account such factors as the AV Homes Board considers in good faith to be appropriate (including the conditionality, timing and likelihood of
consummation of, and the person, entity, or group making, such proposals), (a) is reasonably likely

to be consummated in accordance with its terms and (b) if consummated, would reasonably be expected to result in a transaction that is more favorable
from a financial point of view to AV Homes’ stockholders than the Merger, taking into account all financial terms and conditions of such transaction
(including breakup fees, expense reimbursement and other financial terms).

Change of AV Homes Board Recommendation

AV Homes has agreed that it will not and will cause its subsidiaries not to and will instruct and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
representatives not to (i) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) withhold, withdraw or
rescind (or change or qualify, in a manner adverse to Taylor Morrison or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw or rescind (or change or
qualify in a manner adverse to Taylor Morrison or Merger Sub, the AV Homes Board’s recommendation that AV Homes stockholders adopt the Merger
Agreement pursuant to Section 251 of the DGCL (which we refer to as the “AV Homes Board Recommendation”), including the failure to include the
AV Homes Board Recommendation in this proxy statement/prospectus; or (iii) resolve to do any of the foregoing. We refer to the actions described in
clauses (i) through (iii) of the previous sentence as an “AV Homes Recommendation Change.”

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, the AV Homes Board, at any time before AV Homes stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement,
may make an AV Homes Recommendation Change in response to either (i) a Superior Proposal that did not result from a violation of AV Homes’
non-solicitation obligations, or (ii) an Intervening Event (as defined below), in each case only if the AV Homes Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with AV Homes’ outside legal counsel, that a failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the AV Homes Board under
applicable law.

AV Homes may not make an AV Homes Recommendation Change unless:
 

 

•  AV Homes has given Taylor Morrison at least three (3) business days’ prior written notice that the AV Homes Board intends to make an AV
Homes Recommendation Change (which we refer to as the “Notice Period”), which notice must specify the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal (and shall have provided to Taylor Morrison a copy of the available proposed transaction agreement to be entered
into in respect of such Acquisition Proposal) or details of such Intervening Event as applicable.

 

 

•  during each Notice Period, AV Homes negotiates in good faith with Taylor Morrison, to the extent Taylor Morrison desires to negotiate, so
that Taylor Morrison may propose in writing an amendment to the Merger Agreement that would reasonably be expected to (i) obviate the
need to effect an AV Homes Recommendation Change or (ii) cause such Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, as
applicable;

 

 

•  the AV Homes Board shall have considered in good faith any adjustments or proposed amendments to the Merger Agreement and any other
agreements that may be proposed in writing by Taylor Morrison (the “Proposed Changed Terms”) no later than 11:59 a.m., New York City
time, on the last day of the Notice Period and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its advisors and outside counsel,
that the failure to make a AV Homes Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Provided, however, that any material changes relating to an Intervening Event or material revisions to a Superior Proposal offered in writing by
the party making such Superior Proposal, shall constitute a new Intervening Event or Acquisition Proposal, as applicable, and in each case AV Homes
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Taylor Morrison and to again comply with the requirements for the first notice, except that the Notice
Period shall be two (2) business days.

An “Intervening Event” means any event, change, effect, development, state of facts, condition or occurrence (other than any event, change,
effect, development, state of facts, condition or occurrence resulting

avoid any action or proceeding by any governmental entity or any other person or entity, in connection with the authorization, execution and
delivery of the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger;

issuance of a final, nonappealable order;

 

 
•  seeking to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order that may adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate the

transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, in each case until the issuance of a final, nonappealable order;

respective affiliates, or permit AV Homes or any subsidiary of AV Homes or any of their respective affiliates, to (A) undertake any efforts, or to take or

predecessors before the effective time of the Merger will be treated as service with Taylor Morrison or any of its subsidiaries; however, such service
need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

Each AV Homes employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee benefit plans of Taylor
Morrison and its subsidiaries to the extent that coverage under such plans is comparable to an AV Homes employee benefit plan in which such AV
Homes employee participated immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger.

For purposes of each medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plan maintained by Taylor Morrison and its subsidiaries, Taylor Morrison
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements in which AV Homes employees (and their covered dependents), unless such conditions would not have been waived
under the comparable AV Homes benefit plan, and (ii) cause any eligible expenses incurred by such AV Homes employees (and their covered
dependents) during the portion of the plan year of the comparable AV Homes benefit plan ending on the date such employee’s participation in the
corresponding Taylor Morrison benefit plan begins to be taken into account under such Taylor Morrison benefit plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such AV Homes employees (and their covered dependents) for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Taylor Morrison benefit plan.

Under the Merger Agreement, Taylor Morrison has acknowledged that a change in control will occur at the effective time of the Merger under AV
Homes’ benefit plans. In addition, under the Merger Agreement, AV Homes is permitted to implement a retention program for certain AV Homes’
employees.

Treatment of AV Homes Convertible Notes

The Merger constitutes a “Fundamental Change” for purposes of the indenture governing the AV Homes Convertible Notes. Upon the occurrence
of a Fundamental Change, the holders of the AV Homes Convertible

Table of Contents

Notes can cause AV Homes (or its successor) to repurchase the AV Homes Convertible Notes at a price consisting of 100% of their aggregate principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of repurchase.

Holders of the AV Homes Convertible Notes may also convert them at an increased conversion rate in connection with the Merger, and if such
conversion occurs with respect to all of the AV Homes Convertible Notes, such holders would be entitled to the Merger Consideration that would be
paid to holders of a total of approximately 4.4 million shares of AV Homes Common Stock. The form of such Merger Consideration would be the form
elected by holders of a plurality of the AV Homes Common Stock. Such Merger Consideration would consist of (i) an aggregate of approximately
$95.0 million in cash if holders of a plurality of AV Homes Common Stock elect to receive all of the Merger Consideration in cash, (ii) an aggregate of
approximately 4.3 million shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock if holders of a plurality of such AV Homes Common Stock elect to receive all of
the Merger Consideration in Taylor Morrison Common Stock and (iii) an aggregate of approximately $55.8 million in cash and approximately
1.8 million shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock if holders of a plurality of such AV Homes Common Stock elect to receive mixed cash and stock
consideration. The combined company expects to fund any required additional cash payments from additional borrowings under its revolving credit
facility.

The consideration deliverable upon conversion of AV Homes Convertible Notes as described in the preceding paragraph assumes that the Merger
closes on October 1, 2018, and the average closing price of the AV Homes Common Stock on the last five trading days preceding the closing date is
$21.50. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the AV Homes Convertible Notes, the number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the AV Homes Convertible Notes will vary based on the date of closing of the Merger and such average closing price. Any AV
Homes Convertible Notes that are not repurchased or converted will remain outstanding.

Treatment of AV Homes Equity Awards

AV Homes Options. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding option to purchase shares of AV Homes Common Stock will be
converted into the right to receive a cash payment consisting of the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Cash Consideration (before giving effect to
any proration adjustment) over the exercise price per share of such option and (ii) the number of shares subject to such option.

AV Homes Restricted Stock Awards. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding AV Homes restricted stock award will be substituted
with a Taylor Morrison restricted stock award corresponding to a number of whole shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock (rounded to the nearest
whole share) consisting of the product of (i) the number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock subject to the AV Homes restricted stock award
(assuming that any performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such award are fully achieved) and (ii) the Stock Consideration (before giving
effect to any proration adjustment). Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, each Taylor Morrison restricted stock award will continue
to have the same vesting and acceleration of vesting terms and conditions (other than any performance-based vesting conditions) as, and other terms and
conditions that are substantially similar to, those that applied to the corresponding AV Homes restricted stock award. If the holder of a Taylor Morrison
restricted stock award experiences a termination without cause or resigns with good reason, in each case, within 24 months following a change in
control (including the Merger) (referred to as a “qualifying termination”), the Taylor Morrison restricted stock award will fully vest.

AV Homes RSU Awards. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding restricted stock unit award in respect of shares of AV Homes
Common Stock (referred to as an “AV Homes RSU award”) that is held by an employee of AV Homes or its subsidiaries will be substituted with a
Taylor Morrison restricted stock unit corresponding to a number of whole shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole
share) consisting of the product of (i) the number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock subject to the AV

Homes award (assuming that any performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such award are achieved at target levels) and (ii) the Stock
Consideration (before giving effect to any proration adjustment). Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, each Taylor Morrison
restricted stock unit will continue to have the same vesting and acceleration of vesting terms and conditions (other than any performance-based vesting
conditions) as, and other terms and conditions that are substantially similar to, those that applied to the corresponding AV Homes RSU award. If the
holder of a Taylor Morrison restricted stock unit experiences a qualifying termination, the Taylor Morrison award will fully vest.

At the effective time of the Merger, each AV Homes RSU award held by a non-employee director of AV Homes will be converted into the right to
receive the Cash Consideration (before giving effect to any proration adjustment) in respect of each share of AV Homes Common Stock underlying such
award.

At any time before the effective time of the Merger, any party may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other party, (ii) waive any breach of the representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant thereto,

(which we refer to as the “Voting Agreement”), which is included in this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B, is incorporated by reference herein in
its entirety, and qualifies the following summary in its entirety. The rights and obligations of Taylor Morrison and TPG, as parties to the Voting
Agreement, are governed by the Voting Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this
proxy statement/prospectus. AV Homes stockholders are urged to read the Voting Agreement carefully and in its entirety, as well as this proxy

The following summary of the Voting Agreement is included in this proxy statement/prospectus to provide you with information regarding the

Find More Information.”

AV Homes has one class of voting stock issued and outstanding, the AV Homes Common Stock, which votes on all matters presented to AV
Homes stockholders for their vote or approval. TPG is the beneficial owner of, and has sole or shared voting power with respect to, 9,215,017 shares of

the TPG Shares and not commit to do, consent to, or otherwise facilitate any of the foregoing, except in cases where the transferee executes
a customary joinder to the Voting Agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to Taylor Morrison agreeing to be bound by the Voting
Agreement in the same manner as TPG, including full recourse to the TPG Shares so transferred for any violation of the Voting Agreement
by TPG or such transferee or (ii) deposited into a voting trust or become subject to a voting agreement or arrangement or a grant of a proxy

PROPOSAL II: ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules promulgated thereunder, AV Homes is required to submit a
proposal to AV Homes’ stockholders for a nonbinding, advisory vote to approve the payment by AV Homes of certain compensation that may become
payable to the named executive officers of AV Homes that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, as described in “Proposal I: Adoption of the
Merger Agreement—Interests of Certain AV Homes Directors and Officers in the Merger,” including the footnotes to the table. This proposal is referred
to herein as the “named executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal.”

The AV Homes Board unanimously recommends that AV Homes’ stockholders approve the following resolution:

RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to AV Homes’ named executive
officers in connection with the Merger, and the agreement or understandings pursuant to which such
compensation may be paid or become payable, in each case, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K in the table in the section of this proxy statement entitled “Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement—Interests of Certain AV Homes Directors and Officers in the Merger,” including the footnotes to the
table and the related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.

The vote on the named executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to
approve the Merger. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Merger and vote not to approve the named executive officer Merger-related
compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal is advisory only, it will
not be binding on either AV Homes or Taylor Morrison. Accordingly, if the Merger is approved and the Merger is completed, the compensation will
become payable if the applicable contractual conditions are satisfied, regardless of the outcome of the nonbinding, advisory vote of AV Homes’
stockholders.

The above resolution approving the Merger-related compensation of AV Homes’ named executive officers on an advisory basis will require the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast on such proposal at the AV Homes special meeting.

The AV Homes Board unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” the named executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal.

PROPOSAL III: ADJOURNMENT OF AV HOMES SPECIAL MEETING

AV Homes stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give the AV Homes Board authority to adjourn the AV Homes special
meeting one or more times, if necessary or appropriate, as determined by AV Homes or requested by Taylor Morrison, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the AV Homes special meeting or any adjournments thereof to adopt the Merger Agreement.

If this proposal is approved, the AV Homes special meeting could be adjourned to any date. If the AV Homes special meeting is adjourned, AV
Homes stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use. If you sign and return a proxy
and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you indicate that you wish to vote FOR the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement or
FOR the named executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal but do not indicate a choice on the adjournment proposal, your shares of AV
Homes Common Stock will be voted FOR the adjournment proposal. If you indicate, however, that you wish to vote against the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement or against the named executive officer Merger-related compensation proposal, your shares of AV Homes Common Stock will only be
voted FOR the adjournment proposal if you indicate that you wish to vote FOR that proposal.

The affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the votes which could be cast by the holders of all classes of stock entitled
to vote on such question which are present in person or by proxy at the AV Homes special meeting is required to approve the adjournment proposal.

The AV Homes Board recommends that AV Homes stockholders vote FOR the approval of the adjournment of the AV Homes special
meeting, if necessary or appropriate, as determined by AV Homes or requested by Taylor Morrison, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the AV Homes special meeting or any adjournments thereof to adopt the Merger Agreement.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Taylor Morrison and AV Homes entered into the Merger Agreement on June 7, 2018. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, AV Homes
will be merged with and into Merger Sub, a subsidiary of Taylor Morrison, and each share of AV Homes Common Stock will be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, which will be paid in the form specified in the Merger Agreement. Upon completion of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and AV Homes will continue as the Surviving Corporation in the Merger.

The following presents the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheets of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes, giving effect to the
Merger as if it had been consummated on June 30, 2018. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the six months
ended June 30, 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2017 present the historical consolidated statements of operations of Taylor Morrison and AV
Homes, giving effect to the Merger as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2017, the beginning of the earliest period presented. The fiscal years of
Taylor Morrison and AV Homes both end on December 31.

As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, Taylor Morrison has completed a preliminary fair value assessment with respect to the AV
Homes assets to be acquired and the AV Homes liabilities to be assumed but has not yet finalized its fair value measurements. In connection with the
preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, Taylor Morrison has estimated the fair value of AV Homes’ owned
inventory based on discussions with AV Homes’ management, preliminary analyses, due diligence and information presented in public filings. The
valuations necessary to arrive at estimates of the fair value of the AV Homes inventory assets to be acquired and the AV Homes liabilities to be assumed
are preliminary and subject to completion. All other assets and liabilities are presented at carrying value and are also subject to completion of fair value
analysis. In addition, there may be additional adjustments necessary to conform AV Homes accounting policies to Taylor Morrison’s accounting
policies. A final determination of the fair value of AV Homes’ assets and liabilities will be based on the actual assets and liabilities of AV Homes that
exist as of the date of completion of the Merger. Additionally, the final value of the consideration to be paid by Taylor Morrison to complete the Merger
will be determined based on the ending number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock outstanding at the time of the completion of the Merger. Within
12 months after the completion of the Merger, final valuations will be completed and reflected in the combined company’s financial information. There
may be differences between these preliminary estimates and the final valuations, and these differences could have a material impact on the
accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and the combined company’s future results of operations and financial
position. Accordingly, the preliminary pro forma adjustments have been made solely for the purpose of providing the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements presented below and are subject to further adjustments.

These unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been developed from and should be read in conjunction with (1) the
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes contained in their respective Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and (2) the audited consolidated financial statements of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes contained in their
respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, all of which are incorporated by reference in this proxy
statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport
to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations or the consolidated financial position of Taylor Morrison would have been had the Merger
occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of the future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position of
the combined company.

(g) Adjustments to Cost of Home Closings and Interest Expense    

To reflect the capitalization of AV Homes’ interest expense incurred relating to
homebuilding operations and subsequent amortization of such expense. Taylor
Morrison estimates all interest expense incurred by AV Homes will be
capitalizable as a result of sufficient qualifying assets following the Merger.    

Adjustment to cost of home closings to reflect the capitalization of interest
expense for the periods presented   $ (6,403)  $ (10,618) 

Adjustment to amortization to reflect the amortization of interest expense for the
periods presented   $ 6,403  $ 10,618 

(h) Adjustments to Income tax provision    
The pro forma income tax provision represents the dollar amounts actually reported for each company on a combined basis, which reflects a

combined effective tax rate as if Taylor Morrison and AV Homes were operating jointly during these periods. This approach was used, since
Taylor Morrison and AV Homes primarily operate in overlapping jurisdictions. As a result, the combined company’s federal and state income
tax rate is not expected to materially differ from the income tax rates used by Taylor Morrison and AV Homes as stand-alone entities. We
expect the combined company to be subject to a statutory tax rate of approximately 25%, which does not include any discrete tax adjustments.
The statutory tax rate is comprised of a US federal rate of 21% and a combined state rate of 4%.

(i) Adjustments to Net income attributable to non-controlling interests —
Principal Equityholders    

Net income attributable to non-controlling interests—Principal Equityholders is
based on the Principal Equityholders’ weighted average ownership percentage
of Taylor Morrison. As a result of the adjustment of weighted average shares,
the ownership percentage of Taylor Morrison’s Principal Equity holders
decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and the twelve months ended
December 31, 2017. The adjustment presented reflects the pro forma net
income associated with the Principal Equityholders’ ownership and
subsequently the adjusted net income available to the pro forma combined
company(2).   $ 189  $ 16,032 

 
(2) Principal Equityholders of Taylor Morrison as of December 31, 2017 consisted of TPG, Oaktree, and current and former members of Taylor

Morrison’s management. As of January 17, 2018, TPG and Oaktree no longer had an investment in Taylor Morrison and therefore the ownership
percentage of the Principal Equityholders decreased to 0.8% at June 30, 2018 from 31.1% at December 31, 2017.

NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Basis of Presentation

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X Article 11 which gives
effect to the Merger under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, “Business Combinations” using the acquisition method of accounting giving
effect to the Merger involving Taylor Morrison and AV Homes, with Taylor Morrison as the accounting acquirer.

The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements present the pro forma consolidated financial position and
results of operations of the combined company, based on the historical financial statements of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes, after giving effect to the
Merger and adjustments described in the notes thereto, and are intended to reflect the impact of the Merger on Taylor Morrison’s condensed
consolidated financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is
not necessarily indicative of the financial position of the combined company had the Merger been consummated at June 30, 2018 or the results of
operations of the combined company had the Merger been consummated at January 1, 2017, nor is it necessarily indicative of the results of operations of
the combined company in future periods or the future financial position of the combined company.

Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of AV Homes will be recorded at the respective fair values on the Merger
date. The fair value on the Merger date represents management’s best preliminary estimates based on available information and facts and circumstances
in existence on the Merger date. The pro forma allocation of purchase price reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
information is preliminary and subject to adjustment. Adjustments may include, but not be limited to, changes in (i) the underlying values of assets and
liabilities if market conditions differ from current assumptions; or (ii) if information unknown as of the completion of the Merger becomes known.

The accounting policies of both Taylor Morrison and AV Homes are in the process of being reviewed in detail. Upon completion of such review,
conforming adjustments or financial statement reclassification may be determined.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect the preliminary valuation of the net assets acquired
including goodwill. The valuation of the assets and liabilities in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements is based upon the
estimated purchase price. This amount was derived based on the Merger Consideration to be paid to holders of AV Homes Common Stock. Under the
Merger Agreement, the holders of AV Homes Common Stock will be permitted to elect to receive per share consideration consisting of (i) 0.9793 of a
share of Taylor Morrison Common Stock, (ii) $21.50 in cash or (iii) a combination of $12.64 in cash and 0.4034 share of Taylor Morrison Common
Stock. The Merger Agreement provides for the proration of AV Homes stockholder elections such that the aggregate Merger Consideration will consist
of approximately 58.8% cash and approximately 41.2% Taylor Morrison Common Stock. As a result, for purposes of the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information, it has been assumed that Taylor Morrison will pay holders of AV Homes Common Stock aggregate Merger
Consideration consisting of a combination of cash and shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock. The actual number of shares of Taylor Morrison’s
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger will be based upon the actual number shares of AV Homes Common Stock outstanding when the Merger is
completed.

For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, it has been assumed that the $80.0 million outstanding
aggregate principal amount of the AV Homes Convertible Notes has not been converted and remains outstanding. The Merger constitutes a
“Fundamental Change” for purposes of the indenture governing the AV Homes Convertible Notes. Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change, the
holders of the AV Homes Convertible Notes can cause AV Homes (or its successor) to repurchase the AV

Table of Contents

Homes Convertible Notes at a price equal to 100% of their aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of
repurchase. Holders of the AV Homes Convertible Notes may also convert them at an increased conversion rate in connection with the Merger, and if
such conversion occurs with respect to all of the AV Homes Convertible Notes, such holders would be entitled to the Merger Consideration that would
be paid to holders of a total of approximately 4.4 million shares of AV Homes Common Stock. The form of such Merger Consideration would be the
form elected by holders of a plurality of the AV Homes Common Stock. Such Merger Consideration would consist of (i) an aggregate of approximately
$95.0 million in cash if holders of a plurality of AV Homes Common Stock elect to receive all of the Merger Consideration in cash, (ii) an aggregate of
approximately 4.3 million shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock if holders of a plurality of such AV Homes Common Stock elect to receive all of
the Merger Consideration in Taylor Morrison Common Stock and (iii) an aggregate of approximately $55.8 million in cash and approximately
1.8 million shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock if holders of a plurality of such AV Homes Common Stock elect to receive mixed cash and stock
consideration. The combined company expects to fund any required additional cash payments from additional borrowings under its revolving credit
facility.

The consideration deliverable upon conversion of AV Homes Convertible Notes as described in the preceding paragraph assumes that the Merger
closes on October 1, 2018, and the average closing price of the AV Homes Common Stock on the last five trading days preceding the closing date is
$21.50. Pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the AV Homes Convertible Notes, the number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the AV Homes Convertible Notes will vary based on the date of closing of the Merger and such average closing price. Any AV
Homes Convertible Notes that are not repurchased or converted will remain outstanding.

2. Estimated Merger and Integration Costs

In connection with the Merger, the plan to integrate Taylor Morrison’s and AV Homes’ operations is still being developed. The combined
company expects to incur costs associated with integrating the operations of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements do not reflect the costs of any integration activities or benefits that may result from realization of future cost savings from
expected operating efficiencies or synergies. Over the next several months, the specific details of these plans will continue to be refined. Taylor
Morrison and AV Homes are currently in the process of assessing their respective businesses to determine where they may eliminate potential
redundancies. Taylor Morrison expects to incur Merger-related expenses including system conversion costs, employee retention and severance
agreements, communications to customers, and others. To the extent there are costs associated with these actions, the costs will be recorded based on the
nature and timing of these integration actions. Most acquisition and restructuring costs are recognized separately from a business combination and
generally will be expensed as incurred. Taylor Morrison currently estimates that Merger-related costs will be approximately $70.0 million and expects
they will be incurred primarily in the year ending December 31, 2018. These estimated costs are not reflected in the accompanying pro forma condensed
combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2018 because they are non-recurring, but
they are reflected in the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2018 as an adjustment to retained earnings within Total
Stockholder’s equity.

3. Preliminary Purchase Price

The preliminary purchase price was derived based on the Merger Consideration to be paid to holders of AV Homes Common Stock. Under the
Merger Agreement, the holders of AV Homes Common Stock will be permitted to elect to receive per share consideration consisting of (i) 0.9793 of a
share of Taylor Morrison Common Stock, (ii) $21.50 in cash or (iii) $12.64 in cash and 0.4034 share of Taylor Morrison Common Stock. The Merger
Agreement provides for the proration of AV Homes stockholder elections such that the aggregate Merger Consideration will consist of approximately
58.8% cash and approximately 41.2% Taylor Morrison Common Stock. The following is a preliminary calculation of the purchase price in the Merger,

DESCRIPTION OF TAYLOR MORRISON’S CAPITAL STOCK

The following is a summary of the material terms of Taylor Morrison’s capital stock. Because it is only a summary, it may not contain all of the
information that may be important to you and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Taylor Morrison Charter and the Taylor Morrison Bylaws.
Accordingly, you should read the more detailed provisions of the Taylor Morrison Charter and the Taylor Morrison Bylaws.

Capital Stock

Taylor Morrison’s authorized capital stock consists of 400,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, 200,000,000
shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.00001 per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.00001 per share. As of July 10,
2018, Taylor Morrison has approximately 111,387,224 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, 863,434 shares of Class B common stock
outstanding and no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

Common Stock

Voting. Holders of Taylor Morrison Common Stock and Taylor Morrison Class B Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all
matters submitted to stockholders for their vote or approval. The holders of Taylor Morrison’s Common Stock and Taylor Morrison Class B Common
Stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to stockholders for their vote or approval, except with respect to the amendment of certain
provisions of the Taylor Morrison Charter that would alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the Taylor Morrison Class B Common
Stock so as to affect them adversely, which amendments must be approved by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of the shares
affected by the amendment, voting as a separate class, or as otherwise required by applicable law. The voting power of the outstanding Taylor Morrison
Class B Common Stock (expressed as a percentage of the total voting power of all common stock) is equal to the percentage of limited partnership units
(the “New TMM Units”) of TMM Holdings II Limited Partnership not held directly or indirectly by Taylor Morrison.

Dividends. The holders of Taylor Morrison Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends when, as, and if declared by Taylor Morrison’s board
of directors out of legally available funds. The holders of Taylor Morrison Class B Common Stock do not have any right to receive dividends other than
dividends consisting of shares of Taylor Morrison Class B Common Stock paid proportionally with respect to each outstanding share of Taylor Morrison
Class B Common Stock.

Liquidation or Dissolution. Upon Taylor Morrison’s liquidation or dissolution, the holders of Taylor Morrison Common Stock are entitled to share
ratably in those of Taylor Morrison’s assets that are legally available for distribution to stockholders after payment of liabilities and subject to the prior
rights of any holders of preferred stock then outstanding. Other than their par value, the holders of Taylor Morrison Class B Common Stock do not have
any right to receive a distribution upon a liquidation or dissolution of Taylor Morrison.

Transferability and Exchange. Subject to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, holders of New TMM Units may exchange their New TMM
Units (along with a corresponding number of shares of Taylor Morrison Class B Common Stock) for shares of Taylor Morrison Common Stock. Each
such exchange will be on a one-for-one equivalent basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and
reclassifications. Shares of Taylor Morrison Class B Common Stock may not be transferred except in connection with an exchange or transfer of New
TMM Units.

Upon exchange, each share of Taylor Morrison Class B Common Stock will be canceled.

Preferred Stock

Taylor Morrison has been authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Taylor Morrison’s board of directors has authorized,
subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law and the Taylor Morrison

Table of Contents

Charter, to determine the terms and conditions of the preferred stock, including whether the shares of preferred stock will be issued in one or more
series, the number of shares to be included in each series and the powers, designations, preferences and rights of the shares. Taylor Morrison’s board of
directors is also authorized to designate any qualifications, limitations or restrictions on the shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders.
The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of Taylor Morrison and may adversely
affect the voting and other rights of the holders of Taylor Morrison Common Stock and Taylor Morrison Class B Common Stock, which could have an
adverse impact on the market price of Taylor Morrison Common Stock. Taylor Morrison has no current plan to issue any shares of preferred stock.

Anti-Takeover Effects of Taylor Morrison’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws

The Taylor Morrison Charter and Taylor Morrison Bylaws contain certain provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and
stability in the composition of the board of directors and which may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a future takeover or change in
control of the Company unless such takeover or change in control is approved by Taylor Morrison’s board of directors.

These provisions include:

Term of Directors. The Taylor Morrison Charter previously provided that Taylor Morrison’s board of directors was to be divided into three classes
of directors, with the classes as nearly equal in number as possible. Prior to the 2019 annual meeting of Taylor Morrison’s stockholders, approximately
one-third of Taylor Morrison’s board of directors is elected each year for a term of three years. Commencing with the 2019 annual meeting, directors
(other than any director in office at the 2019 annual meeting who was previously elected to a term expiring at the 2020 or 2021 annual meeting) shall be
elected for a term of one year. As a result, Taylor Morrison’s board of directors will no longer be classified beginning at the 2020 annual meeting. While
the board of directors remains classified, it is more difficult for stockholders to change the composition of Taylor Morrison’s board of directors. The
Taylor Morrison Charter also provides that, subject to any rights of holders of preferred stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances,
the number of directors will be fixed exclusively pursuant to a resolution adopted by Taylor Morrison’s board of directors.

Action by Written Consent; Special Meetings of Stockholders. The Taylor Morrison Charter provides that stockholder action can be taken only at
an annual or special meeting of stockholders and cannot be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting. The Taylor Morrison Charter and the Taylor
Morrison Bylaws also provide that, except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of the stockholders can only be called by the Chairman or
Vice-Chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, or pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the board of directors.

Advance Notice Procedures. The Taylor Morrison Bylaws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an
annual meeting of Taylor Morrison’s stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to the board of directors. Stockholders at an
annual meeting are only able to consider proposals or nominations specified in the notice of meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction
of the board of directors or by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record on the record date for the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting
and who has given Taylor Morrison’s Secretary timely written notice, in proper form, of the stockholder’s intention to bring that business before the
meeting. Although the Taylor Morrison Bylaws do not give the board of directors the power to approve or disapprove stockholder nominations of
candidates or proposals regarding other business to be conducted at a special or annual meeting, the Taylor Morrison Bylaws may have the effect of
precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed or may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from
conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of Taylor Morrison.

Super-Majority Approval Requirements. The Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that the affirmative vote of a majority of the
shares entitled to vote on any matter is required to amend a corporation’s

certificate of incorporation or bylaws, unless either a corporation’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws require a greater percentage. The Taylor
Morrison Charter and the Taylor Morrison Bylaws provides that the affirmative vote of holders of at least 75% of the total votes eligible to be cast in the
election of directors is required to amend, alter, change or repeal specified provisions, including those relating to actions by written consent of
stockholders, calling of special meetings of stockholders, the provisions relating to business combinations, and until such time as all directors who were
elected prior to the 2019 annual meeting to a term expiring at the 2020 or 2021 annual meeting have served the remainder of such term or been
re-elected to serve one-year terms, provisions relating to the board of directors. This requirement of a super-majority vote to approve amendments to the
Taylor Morrison Charter and the Taylor Morrison Bylaws could enable a minority of Taylor Morrison’s stockholders to exercise veto power over any
such amendments.

Authorized but Unissued Shares. Taylor Morrison’s authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are available for future
issuance without stockholder approval. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to
raise additional capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and
preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of a majority of Taylor Morrison’s common stock by means of a
proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.

Business Combinations with Interested Stockholders. Taylor Morrison has elected that the Taylor Morrison Charter not be subject to Section 203
of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an antitakeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in
a business combination, such as a merger, with a person or group owning 15% or more of the corporation’s voting stock for a period of three years
following the date the person became an interested stockholder, unless (with certain exceptions) the business combination or the transaction in which the
person became an interested stockholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, Taylor Morrison is not subject to any anti-takeover effects of
Section 203. Nevertheless, the Taylor Morrison Charter contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203, except that they provide that
certain former equityholders of Taylor Morrison and their respective affiliates, including affiliates of TPG Global, LLC, and transferees may not be
deemed to be “interested stockholders,” regardless of the percentage of Taylor Morrison’s voting stock owned by them, and accordingly will not be
subject to such restrictions.

Directors’ Liability; Indemnification of Directors and Officers

The Taylor Morrison Charter limits the liability of Taylor Morrison’s directors to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation
Law and provides that Taylor Morrison will provide them with customary indemnification. Taylor Morrison has entered into customary indemnification
agreements with each of Taylor Morrison’s executive officers and directors that provide them, in general, with customary indemnification in connection
with their service to Taylor Morrison or on Taylor Morrison’s behalf.

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS

Taylor Morrison and AV Homes are both Delaware corporations subject to the provisions of the DGCL. At the effective time of the Merger, each
share of AV Homes Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, consisting of
either: (i) Stock Consideration, (ii) Cash Consideration, or (iii) Mixed Consideration. No fractional shares will be issued in the Merger, and AV Homes
stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares. As a result, AV Homes stockholders may become stockholders of Taylor Morrison and
will have their rights as stockholders governed by the Taylor Morrison Charter and the Taylor Morrison Bylaws. The Taylor Morrison Charter and the
Taylor Morrison Bylaws will differ from the AV Homes Charter and the AV Homes Bylaws that currently govern the rights of AV Homes stockholders.

Set forth below are the material differences between the rights of a holder of Taylor Morrison Common Stock under the Taylor Morrison Charter
and the Taylor Morrison Bylaws, on the one hand, and a holder of AV Homes Common Stock under the AV Homes Charter and the AV Homes Bylaws,
on the other hand.

The following summary does not reflect any rules of NYSE or Nasdaq or any federal securities laws that may apply to Taylor Morrison or AV
Homes in connection with the matters discussed. In addition, this summary does not purport to be a complete discussion of, and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to, the DGCL and the constituent documents of Taylor Morrison and AV Homes.

Morrison Charter, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by the DGCL.
Certain provisions of the Taylor Morrison Charter, however, may not be

capital stock of Taylor Morrison entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class, at a meeting of the stockholders

Right to Call a Special Meeting of Stockholders

The Taylor Morrison Charter and the Taylor Morrison Bylaws provide that a
special meeting of stockholders may be called only (i) by or at the direction
of the Taylor Morrison Board pursuant to a written resolution adopted by a
majority of the total number of directors which Taylor Morrison would have
if there were no vacancies or (ii) by or at the direction of the Chairman or

Indemnifications

The Taylor Morrison Charter and the Taylor Morrison Bylaws provide that
Taylor Morrison will indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may be amended, a
Covered Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to
any threatened, pending or completed Proceeding, by reason of the fact that
he or she was a director or officer of Taylor Morrison or, while a director or
officer of Taylor Morrison, is or was serving at the request of Taylor Morrison
as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including
service with respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss
suffered and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) reasonably incurred by such
person.
 

Taylor Morrison shall not be required to indemnify a Covered Person in
connection with a Proceeding commenced by such Covered Person (other
than a Proceeding brought by such Covered Person (i) by way of defense or
counterclaim, or (ii) to enforce such Covered Person’s rights to
indemnification, advancement or contribution under any agreement,
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or under statute or other law) unless the
commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the Covered Person
was authorized by the Taylor Morrison Board.   

The AV Homes Charter and the AV Homes Bylaws provide that AV
Homes will indemnify and hold harmless any person who was or is
made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in
any Proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she or a person whom
he or she is the legal representative of is or was a director, officer or
employee of AV Homes or a majority-owned subsidiary of AV Homes,
whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official
capacity as a director, officer or employee or in any other capacity
while serving as a director, officer or employee in accordance with and
to the fullest extent permitted from time to time by the DGCL as the
same exists or may be amended or any other applicable laws as
presently or hereafter in effect. Such indemnification shall continue as
to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or employee and
shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and
administrators; provided, however, that AV Homes shall indemnify any
such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding
(or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or
part thereof) was authorized by the AV Homes Board or is a proceeding
to enforce such person’s claim to indemnification.

State Antitakeover Statutes and Certain Certificate of Incorporation Provisions

Taylor Morrison is not governed by Section 203 of the DGCL as provided in
the Taylor Morrison Charter.
 

The Taylor Morrison Charter provides that Taylor Morrison will not engage
in any business combination, at any point in time at which Taylor Morrison
Common Stock is registered under Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange
Act, with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the
time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless: (i) prior
to such time, the Taylor Morrison Board approved either the business
combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an
interested stockholder, or (ii) upon consummation of the transaction which
resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested
stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of Taylor Morrison, or
(iii) at or subsequent to such time, the business combination is approved by
the Taylor Morrison Board and authorized at an annual or special meeting of
stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least
2/3 of the outstanding voting stock of Taylor Morrison which is not owned by
the interested stockholder.   

AV Homes does not opt out of Section 203 of the DGCL in the AV
Homes Charter and therefore Section 203 of the DGCL applies to AV
Homes. Section 203 of the DGCL protects publicly-traded Delaware
companies, such as AV Homes from hostile takeovers, and from
actions following the takeover, by prohibiting certain business
combinations once an acquirer has gained a significant holding in the
corporation.
 

The AV Homes Charter provides that AV Homes shall not merge or
consolidate with any individual, firm, corporation or partnership in
which any controlling stockholder has a direct or indirect interest of
50% or more of the AV Homes Common Stock, unless the holders of at
least the majority of the outstanding stock of AV Homes, exclusive of
those shares held by such controlling stockholder, approve the merger
or consolidation.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

General

This section summarizes certain material provisions of Delaware law pertaining to appraisal rights. The following discussion, however, is not a
full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of Section 262 of the DGCL, a copy
of which is attached as Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference herein. All references in Section 262 of the DGCL to
“stockholder” are to the record holder of the shares of AV Homes Common Stock. The following discussion does not constitute any legal or other
advice, nor does it constitute a recommendation as to whether or not an AV Homes stockholder should exercise its right to seek appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL.

If you hold one or more shares of AV Homes Common Stock continuously through the effective date of the Merger, neither vote in favor of the
Merger nor consent thereto in writing, and otherwise comply with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL, you are entitled to appraisal
rights under Delaware law and have the right to demand appraisal of your shares in connection with the Merger, have your shares appraised by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and receive the “fair value” of such shares (as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, exclusive of any element of
value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger) as of the completion of the Merger in place of the Merger Consideration. Any such
AV Homes stockholder awarded “fair value” for the holder’s shares by the court would receive payment of that fair value in cash, together with interest,
if any, in lieu of the right to receive the Merger Consideration. It is possible that any such “fair value” as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
may be more or less than, or the same as, that which AV Homes stockholders will receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

Under Section 262 of the DGCL, because AV Homes stockholders are being asked to adopt the Merger Agreement at a meeting of stockholders,
not less than 20 days prior to the AV Homes special meeting to adopt such agreement, AV Homes must notify each stockholder who was an AV Homes
stockholder on the record date for notice of such meeting and who is entitled to exercise appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in
the notice a copy of Section 262 of the DGCL. This proxy statement/prospectus constitutes the required notice, and the copy of Section 262 of the
DGCL is attached as Annex E to this proxy statement/prospectus.

A HOLDER OF AV HOMES COMMON STOCK WHO WISHES TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS OR WHO WISHES TO
PRESERVE THE RIGHT TO DO SO SHOULD REVIEW THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY AND ANNEX E CAREFULLY. FAILURE TO
COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURES OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL IN A TIMELY AND PROPER MANNER MAY RESULT IN THE
LOSS OF APPRAISAL RIGHTS. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO
SEEK APPRAISAL, IF A HOLDER OF AV HOMES COMMON STOCK WISHES TO EXERCISE HIS, HER OR ITS APPRAISAL
RIGHTS, THE HOLDER IS URGED TO CONSULT WITH ITS OWN LEGAL AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS IN CONNECTION WITH
COMPLIANCE UNDER SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. AN AV HOMES STOCKHOLDER WHO LOSES HIS, HER OR ITS APPRAISAL
RIGHTS WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THE PER SHARE MERGER CONSIDERATION.

How to Exercise and Perfect Your Appraisal Rights

If you are an AV Homes stockholder and wish to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of your shares of AV Homes Common Stock, you must
comply with ALL of the following:
 

 

•  you must not vote FOR, or otherwise consent in writing to, the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Because a proxy that is signed and
submitted but does not otherwise contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, if you vote by proxy and wish to exercise your appraisal rights, you must vote against the adoption of the Merger Agreement or
abstain from voting your shares;

Table of Contents

 
•  you must deliver to AV Homes a written demand for appraisal before the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the

AV Homes special meeting, and such demand must reasonably inform AV Homes of your identity and your intention to demand appraisal of
your shares of AV Homes Common Stock. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote;

 

 
•  you must continuously hold your shares of AV Homes Common Stock from the date of making the demand through the effective date of the

Merger. You will lose your appraisal rights if you transfer the shares before the effective time of the Merger; and
 

 

•  you, another stockholder, an appropriate beneficial owner or the surviving company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery
requesting a determination of the fair value of the shares of AV Homes Common Stock within 120 days after the effective date of the
Merger. The surviving company is under no obligation to file any such petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery and has no intention of
doing so. Accordingly, it is the obligation of AV Homes stockholders or a beneficial owner of AV Homes Common Stock to initiate all
necessary action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of shares of AV Homes Common Stock within the time prescribed in Section 262
of the DGCL.

In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss appraisal proceedings as to all shares of AV Homes capital stock if, immediately before
the Merger, such shares were listed on a national securities exchange unless (i) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of the class or series of AV Homes stock eligible for appraisal, or (ii) the value of the consideration provided in the Merger for such
total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds $1 million. We refer to these conditions as the “ownership thresholds.” Because AV Homes
Common Stock is listed on a national securities exchange and is expected to continue be listed on such exchange immediately before the Merger, at least
one of the ownership thresholds must be met in order for AV Homes stockholders to be entitled to seek appraisal with respect to such shares of AV
Homes Common Stock.

Voting, in person or by proxy, against, abstaining from voting on or failing to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement will not constitute a
written demand for appraisal as required by Section 262 of the DGCL. The written demand for appraisal is in addition to and separate from any proxy or
vote.

Who May Exercise Appraisal Rights

Only a holder of record of shares of AV Homes Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger may
assert appraisal rights for the shares of AV Homes Common Stock registered in that holder’s name. A demand for appraisal must be executed by or on
behalf of the stockholder of record. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the stockholder’s name as it appears on the stock certificates (or in
the stock ledger). The demand must reasonably inform AV Homes of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends to demand appraisal
of his, her or its AV Homes Common Stock. Beneficial owners who do not also hold their shares of AV Homes Common Stock of record may not
directly make appraisal demands to AV Homes. The beneficial owner must, in such cases, have the holder of record, such as a bank, broker or other
nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares of AV Homes Common Stock of record. A holder of record, such as a bank, broker or
other nominee, who holds shares of AV Homes Common Stock as a nominee or intermediary for others may exercise his, her or its right of appraisal
with respect to the shares of AV Homes Common Stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial
owners. In that case, the written demand should state the number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no
number of shares of AV Homes Common Stock is expressly mentioned, the demand will be presumed to cover all shares of AV Homes Common Stock
held in the name of the holder of record.

CONSULT WITH YOUR BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE
BANK, BROKERAGE FIRM OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES. IF YOU HAVE A
BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A NOMINEE OR
INTERMEDIARY, YOU MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE HOLDER OF RECORD TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A
TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS. IF YOU HOLD YOUR SHARES THROUGH
A BANK OR BROKERAGE WHO IN TURN HOLDS THE SHARES THROUGH A CENTRAL SECURITIES DEPOSITORY NOMINEE,
SUCH AS THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF SUCH SHARES MUST BE MADE BY OR ON
BEHALF OF THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AND MUST IDENTIFY THE DEPOSITORY NOMINEE AS THE HOLDER OF RECORD.

If you own shares of AV Homes Common Stock jointly with one or more other persons, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, demand for
appraisal must be executed by or for you and all other joint owners. An authorized agent, including an agent for two or more joint owners, may execute
the demand for appraisal for a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the holder or holders of record and expressly disclose the fact
that, in exercising the demand, such person is acting as agent for the holder or holders of record. If you hold shares of AV Homes Common Stock
through a nominee or intermediary who in turn holds the shares through a central securities depository nominee such as Cede & Co., a demand for
appraisal of such shares must be made by or on behalf of the depository nominee and must identify the depository nominee as record holder.

If you elect to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, you should mail or deliver a written demand to:

Surviving Corporation’s Actions After Completion of the Merger

If the Merger is consummated, the Surviving Corporation will give written notice of the effective date of the Merger within 10 days after the
effective date to AV Homes stockholders who did not vote in favor of the Merger Agreement and who made a written demand for appraisal in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. At any time within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger, any AV Homes stockholder that made a
demand for appraisal but did not commence an appraisal proceeding or join in such a proceeding as a named party will have the right to withdraw the
demand and to accept the Merger Consideration in accordance with the Merger Agreement for his, her or its shares of AV Homes Common Stock, but
after such 60-day period a demand for appraisal may be withdrawn only with the written approval of the Surviving Corporation. Within 120 days after
the effective date of the Merger, either the record holder or a beneficial owner of AV Homes Common Stock, provided such person has complied with
the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, or the Surviving Corporation may commence an appraisal
proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a
stockholder or beneficial owner, demanding an appraisal of the value of the shares of AV Homes Common Stock held by all stockholders who have
properly demanded appraisal. The Surviving Corporation is under no obligation to file an appraisal petition and has no intention of doing so. If you
desire to have your shares appraised, you should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of your appraisal rights within the time periods and in
the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.

Within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger, any stockholder or beneficial owner who has complied with the provisions of Section 262
of the DGCL will be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation, upon written request, a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares
of AV Homes

Common Stock not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and with respect to which AV Homes has received demands for appraisal,
and the aggregate number of holders of those shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to you within the later of (a) 10 days after
receipt by the Surviving Corporation of the request therefor or (b) 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal. If you are
the beneficial owner of shares of stock of AV Homes Common Stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee or intermediary on your behalf you may, in
your own name, file an appraisal petition or request from the Surviving Corporation the statement described in this paragraph.

If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by you or another holder of record or beneficial owner of AV Homes Common Stock who has properly
exercised his, her or its appraisal rights in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and a copy of the petition is served on the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to file in the
office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all holders who have
demanded an appraisal of their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the Surviving Corporation.
The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition
by registered or certified mail to the Surviving Corporation and to the stockholders shown on such verified list at the addresses therein stated. Such
notice shall also be given by one (1) or more publications at least one (1) week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation
published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The forms of the notices by
mail and by publication shall be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation. At the
hearing on the petition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will then determine which AV Homes stockholders are entitled to appraisal rights and may
require the stockholders of AV Homes demanding appraisal who hold certificated shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to any AV Homes
stockholder who fails to comply with this direction. Assuming the shares of AV Homes Common Stock remain listed on a national securities exchange
immediately before the Merger, the Delaware Court of Chancery will also dismiss proceedings as to all AV Homes stockholders if neither of the
ownership thresholds described above is met. After the Delaware Court of Chancery determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal
proceeding will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Delaware Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal
proceedings. The Delaware Court of Chancery will thereafter determine the fair value of the shares of AV Homes Common Stock, exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest, if any. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in
its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the Merger through the date of payment of the judgment
will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time
during the period between the effective date of the Merger and the date of payment of the judgment. However, the Surviving Corporation has the right,
at any point prior to the Delaware Court of Chancery’s entry of judgment in the proceedings, to make a voluntary cash payment to each stockholder
entitled to appraisal. If the Surviving Corporation makes such a voluntary cash payment, interest will accrue thereafter only on the sum of (i) the
difference, if any, between the amount paid by the Surviving Corporation in such voluntary cash payment and the fair value of the shares as determined
by the Delaware Court of Chancery and (ii) interest accrued before such voluntary cash payment, unless paid at that time. When the value is determined,
the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, to the stockholders of AV Homes entitled to receive
the same, forthwith in the case of holders of uncertificated stock or upon surrender of their stock certificates in the case of holders of shares represented
by certificates.

In determining the fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to take into account all relevant factors. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the
Delaware Supreme Court discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value
by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of

a company.” The Delaware Supreme Court has stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other factors which were known or which could be ascertained as of the date of the
Merger which throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated
that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which rather applies only to the speculative
elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court construed Section 262 of the DGCL to
mean that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not
the product of speculation, may be considered.”

An opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an
opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. The fair value of shares of AV Homes Common Stock as
determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be greater than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration. Taylor Morrison does
not anticipate offering more than the per share Merger Consideration to any AV Homes stockholder exercising appraisal rights and reserves the rights to
make a voluntary cash payment pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 262 of the DGCL and to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of
Section 262 of the DGCL, the “fair value” of a share of AV Homes Common Stock is less than the per share Merger Consideration. No representation is
made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.

If no party files a petition for appraisal within 120 days after the effective date of the Merger or, assuming the shares of AV Homes Common
Stock remain listed on a national securities exchange immediately before the Merger, if neither of the ownership thresholds above has been satisfied,
then all AV Homes stockholders will lose the right to an appraisal, and will instead receive the per share Merger Consideration described in the Merger
Agreement, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.

The Delaware Court of Chancery may determine the costs of the appraisal proceeding and may allocate those costs to the parties as the Delaware
Court of Chancery determines to be equitable under the circumstances. Each AV Homes stockholder party to the appraisal proceeding is responsible for
its own attorneys’ fees and expert witnesses’ fees and expenses, although, upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may order
all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys’ fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all shares of AV Homes Common Stock entitled to
appraisal.

If you have duly demanded an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL you may not, on or after the effective date of the Merger,
vote the shares of AV Homes Common Stock subject to the demand for any purpose or receive any dividends or other distributions on those shares,
except dividends or other distributions payable to holders of record of AV Homes Common Stock as of a record date prior to the effective date of the
Merger.

If you have not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined such a proceeding as a named party you may withdraw a demand for appraisal and
accept the Merger Consideration by delivering a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the Merger to the Surviving
Corporation, except that any attempt to withdraw made more than 60 days after the effective date of the Merger will require written approval of the
Surviving Corporation, and no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of
the Delaware Court of Chancery. Such approval may be conditioned on the terms the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that
this provision will not affect the right of any AV Homes stockholder that has made an appraisal demand but who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined such proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered in the
Merger within 60 days after the effective date of the Merger. If you fail to

perfect, successfully withdraw your demand for appraisal, or otherwise lose your appraisal rights, your shares of AV Homes Common Stock will be
converted into the right to receive the per share Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, less any withholding taxes.

Failure to follow the steps required by Section 262 of the DGCL for perfecting appraisal rights may result in the loss of your appraisal rights. In
that event, you will be entitled to receive the per share Merger Consideration for your shares of AV Homes Common Stock in accordance with the
Merger Agreement. In view of the complexity of the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, if you are an AV Homes stockholder and are considering
exercising your appraisal rights under the DGCL, you are urged to consult your own legal and financial advisor.

THE PROCESS OF DEMANDING AND EXERCISING APPRAISAL RIGHTS REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH THE
PREREQUISITES OF SECTION 262 OF THE DGCL. IF YOU WISH TO EXERCISE YOUR APPRAISAL RIGHTS, YOU ARE URGED
TO CONSULT WITH YOUR OWN LEGAL AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLIANCE UNDER SECTION
262 OF THE DGCL. TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE ANY INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE FOREGOING SUMMARY AND

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

If the Merger is completed on the expected timetable, AV Homes does not intend to hold a 2019 annual meeting of its stockholders. If, however,
the Merger is not completed on the expected timetable or at all and the AV Homes 2019 annual meeting is held, proposals that stockholders wish to
submit for inclusion in AV Homes’ proxy statement for its 2019 annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act must be
received by AV Homes’ Corporate Secretary at AV Homes, Inc., 6730 N. Scottsdale Road Suite 150, Scottsdale, Arizona, no later than December 19,
2018, unless the date of AV Homes’ 2019 annual meeting is more than 30 days before or after May 31, 2019, in which case the proposal must be
received a reasonable time before AV Homes begins to print and mail its proxy materials for its 2019 annual meeting. Any stockholder proposal
submitted for inclusion must be eligible for inclusion in AV Homes’ proxy statement in accordance with the rules of the SEC.

With respect to proposals submitted by an AV Homes stockholder for consideration at AV Homes’ 2019 annual meeting but not for inclusion in
AV Homes’ proxy statement for such annual meeting, timely written notice of any stockholder proposal must have been received by AV Homes at its
principal executive offices in accordance with the AV Homes Bylaws not later than March 2, 2019, unless the date of AV Homes’ 2019 annual meeting
is more than 30 days before or after May 31, 2019, in which case such written notice by the stockholder to be timely must be received no later than the
close of business on the tenth day following the date on which the first public disclosure of the date of AV Homes’ 2018 annual meeting was made. Such
notice must contain the information required by the AV Homes Bylaws.

Proposals intended to be presented at the 2019 annual meeting of Taylor Morrison stockholders and included in Taylor Morrison’s proxy statement
must have been received by Taylor Morrison at its principal executive offices no later than the close of business on December 18, 2018, and must
otherwise comply with Rule 14a-8. If the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is more than 30 days before or after May 30, 2019, the
proposal must be received a reasonable time before Taylor Morrison begins to print and mail its proxy materials. While the Taylor Morrison Board will
consider stockholder proposals, it reserves the right to omit from the Taylor Morrison proxy statement stockholder proposals that Taylor Morrison is not
required to include under the Exchange Act, including Rule 14a-8.

For any proposal or director nomination that is not submitted for inclusion in Taylor Morrison’s 2019 proxy statement pursuant to the process set
forth above, but is instead sought to be presented directly at the 2019 annual meeting of Taylor Morrison stockholders, stockholders are advised to
review the Taylor Morrison Bylaws as they contain requirements with respect to advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations. To
be timely, the notice must be received at Taylor Morrison’s principal executive offices between January 30, 2019 and the close of business on March 1,
2019 for the 2019 annual meeting of Taylor Morrison stockholders. In the event that the 2019 annual meeting of Taylor Morrison stockholders is
convened more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 60 days after May 30, 2019, notice by the stockholder, to be timely, must be received no
earlier than the 120th day prior to the 2019 annual meeting of Taylor Morrison stockholders and no later than the later of (1) the 90th day prior to the
2019 annual meeting of Taylor Morrison stockholders and (2) the tenth day following the day on which Taylor Morrison notifies stockholders of the date
of the 2019 annual meeting of Taylor Morrison stockholders, either by mail or other public disclosure.

A nomination which does not comply with the requirements of the Taylor Morrison Bylaws may not be considered. The nominating and
governance committee of the Taylor Morrison Board will consider validly nominated director candidates and will provide its recommendations to the
Taylor Morrison Board.

As required by the Taylor Morrison Bylaws, Taylor Morrison stockholders should include the name, biographical information and other relevant
information relating to the recommended director nominee, including, among other things, information that would be required to be included in the
proxy statement filed in accordance with applicable rules under the Exchange Act and the written consent of the director nominee to be

named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected, among other requirements set forth in the Taylor Morrison Bylaws. Evaluation of any such

receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1
THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger and a Subsidiary of Parent (the “Surviving Corporation”). The Merger shall be
effected pursuant to Section 251 of the DGCL and shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, as provided under the DGCL.

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the necessity of further action by the Company or any other Person, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as to read in its entirety in the form of the certificate of incorporation of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall provide that the name
of the Surviving Corporation shall be AV Homes, Inc., the provisions of the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub relating to the incorporator of
Merger Sub shall be omitted and such changes shall be made to comply with Section 5.8), and as so amended shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. In addition, subject to Section 5.8, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary action such that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended so as to read in its entirety as the bylaws of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(c) At the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary action such that the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time, or such other individuals designated by Parent as of the Effective Time, shall become the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office, from and after the Effective Time, in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time, shall continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) If, at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Equity
Interests of the Company or Parent shall occur as a result of any reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period,
the Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

1.2 Closing and Effective Time of the Merger. The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place at 8:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
third (3rd) Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the

applicable conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment
or waiver of those conditions at the Closing) (the “Closing Date”), at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York,
New York 10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto; provided, however, that if the Marketing Period has not
ended at the time of the satisfaction or waiver of all of the applicable conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions that are by their nature
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), the Closing shall occur instead on (a) the earlier
to occur of (i) any Business Day during the Marketing Period, which date must be specified by Parent to the Company in writing not later than 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on the third (3rd) Business Day prior to such date, and (ii) the third (3rd) Business Day immediately following the final day
of the Marketing Period (as it may be extended pursuant to the definition of “Marketing Period”); or (b) such other date and time as agreed to in writing
by the parties hereto. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably practicable on the Closing
Date, or such other date and time to which Merger Sub and the Company may agree in writing, Merger Sub or the Company shall cause a certificate of
merger with respect to the Merger (the “Certificate of Merger”) to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at
the time the Certificate of Merger shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later date and time as is agreed
upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time at which the Merger becomes effective hereinafter referred to as the
“Effective Time”).

ARTICLE 2
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

2.1 Conversion of Securities. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) Conversion of Company Shares. Subject to Section 2.1(c), each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, other than any Company Restricted Stock Award, any Dissenting Share and any Cancelled Share, shall be converted into the right to
receive (i) in the case of a Company Share with respect to which an election to receive Parent Shares (a “Stock Election”) has been properly made and
not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.8 (each, a “Stock Electing Share”), 0.9793 validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Shares (as
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.1(c), the “Stock Election Consideration”); (ii) in the case of a Company Share with respect to which an election to receive
cash (a “Cash Election”) has been properly made and not revoked or lost pursuant to Section 2.8 (each, a “Cash Electing Share”), $21.50 in cash,
without interest (as adjusted pursuant to Section 2.1(c), the “Cash Election Consideration”); or (iii) in the case of a Company Share with respect to
which an election to receive a mix of Parent Shares and cash (a “Mixed Election”) has been properly made and not revoked pursuant to Section 2.8, or
with respect to which no election has been made (each, a “Mixed Consideration Share”), $12.64 in cash, without interest, and 0.4034 validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable Parent Shares (the “Mixed Stock Consideration” and, together with the $12.64 in cash, without interest, the “Mixed
Election Consideration”). From and after the Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.2, including the
right to receive, pursuant to Section 2.7, cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares, if any, into which such Company Shares have been converted pursuant
to this Section 2.1(a) (the “Fractional Share Consideration”), together with the amounts, if any, payable pursuant to Section 2.2(f) (the “Dividend
Consideration”).

(b) Merger Sub Equity Interests. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one

Table of Contents

(1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock
of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(c) Proration. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the Stock Election Consideration and the Cash Election
Consideration shall be subject to adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.1(c):

(i) if the Cash Election Amount exceeds the Available Cash Election Amount, then the following consideration shall be paid in
respect of each Cash Electing Share:

(A) an amount of cash equal to the product of (1) the Cash Election Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment
pursuant to this Section 2.1(c)) multiplied by (2) the greater of (a) a fraction, rounded to four (4) decimal places, the numerator of which is the Available
Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Amount and (b) zero (0) (the amount calculated in clause (2) of this
paragraph, the “Cash Fraction”); and

(B) a number of Parent Shares equal to the product of (1) the Stock Election Consideration (before giving effect to any
adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.1(c)) multiplied by (2) the result of one (1) minus the Cash Fraction; and

(ii) if the Available Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then the following consideration shall be paid in
respect of each Stock Electing Share:

(A) an amount of cash equal to the result of (1) the amount of such excess divided by (2) the number of Stock Electing Shares;
and

(B) a number of Parent Shares equal to the product of (1) the Stock Election Consideration (before giving effect to any
adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.1(c)) multiplied by (2) a fraction, rounded to four (4) decimal places, the numerator of which is the difference
between (a) the Cash Election Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to this Section 2.1(c)) and (b) the amount calculated in
clause (A) of this paragraph and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to this
Section 2.1(c)).

(d) Cancelled Shares. Each Company Share that is owned directly by the Company (or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company),
Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (the “Cancelled Shares”) shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

2.2 Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall designate a reputable U.S. bank or trust company to act as the
exchange agent (the identity and terms of designation and appointment of which shall be subject to the reasonable prior approval of the Company) for
purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Consideration in connection with the Merger (the “Exchange
Agent”). Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Shares issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in book-entry form equal to the
aggregate number of Parent Shares included in the Merger Consideration (excluding any fractional Parent Shares), and (ii) cash in immediately available
funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash included in the Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Consideration (such
evidence of Parent Shares in book-entry form and cash amounts, including any Dividend Consideration, the “Exchange Fund”), in each case, for the sole
benefit of the holders of Company Shares. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make delivery of the Merger

Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. In the event the Exchange Fund shall at any time be insufficient to pay the
aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger
Sub to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such
payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent or Merger Sub, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Exchange
Agent to the holders of the Company Shares; provided that any such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States
government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, in commercial paper obligations rated A 1 or P 1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks
with capital exceeding $5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available). Earnings from such
investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent or Merger Sub, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of
Company Shares.

(b) Procedures for Surrender.

(i) Certificates. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective
Time), Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Company Shares represented by certificates (the “Certificates”), which Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form as Parent and the Exchange Agent shall reasonably agree
upon (a “Letter of Transmittal”) and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in Section 2.2(e)) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration,
as applicable, the forms of which Letter of Transmittal and instructions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company prior to the Effective
Time. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 2.2(e)) to the Exchange Agent or to such other
agent or agents as may be appointed in writing by Merger Sub, and upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with
respect to such Certificates, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and
the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, for each Company Share formerly represented by such Certificates (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 2.5), and any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration, the
Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall
be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, to a Person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either
have been paid or are not required to be paid. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, as contemplated by this Agreement, except for
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares, which shall represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Company Shares in accordance
with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated
Company Shares represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) shall be required to

deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust Company, an executed Letter of Transmittal to
the Exchange Agent to receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a). In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one (1) or more Book-Entry Shares held through The
Depository Trust Company whose Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, shall upon the Effective Time, in accordance with The Depository Trust Company’s
customary procedures (including receipt by the Exchange Agent of an “agent’s message” (or such other evidence of transfer or surrender as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request)) and such other procedures as agreed by the Company, Parent, the Exchange Agent and The Depository Trust
Company, be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee, for the
benefit of the holder of such Book-Entry Shares held through it, as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry
Share the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, for each such Book-Entry Share
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.5) and such Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled.
As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry Shares not
held through The Depository Trust Company (A) a Letter of Transmittal, which shall be in such form as Parent and the Exchange Agent shall reasonably
agree upon and (B) instructions for returning such Letter of Transmittal in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration
and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, the forms of which Letter of Transmittal and instructions shall be subject to the reasonable approval of
the Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon delivery of such Letter of Transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such Letter of Transmittal, duly
executed and in proper form, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, the
Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, for each such Book-Entry Share (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 2.5), and such Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration
with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration
and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares, which
shall be deemed to represent the right to receive payment in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further recording or registration of transfers of Company Shares on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.2. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Shares, except for Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing Dissenting Shares, which shall represent the right
to receive payment in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, as provided in this Agreement.

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest
received with respect thereto) made available to the Exchange Agent that

remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time will be returned to the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who has not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration, the
Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, in accordance with Section 2.2(b) prior to such time shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Merger Consideration, the
Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, in each case without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law, in respect of such holder’s surrender of its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in
Section 2.2(b). Any Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration or Dividend Consideration, as applicable, remaining unclaimed by the
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, Merger Sub, Parent or the Exchange Agent, or any
employee, officer, director, agent or affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any Person in respect of any part of the Merger Consideration, the
Fractional Share Consideration and the Dividend Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit, in customary form, reasonably acceptable
to Parent (which shall contain an agreement in customary form to indemnify Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
affiliates against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or their respective affiliates on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Certificates) of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share Consideration and
the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1(a), without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law. In addition, Merger Sub may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and Dividend Consideration, as applicable, require the owner(s) of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in a reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger
Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

(f) Dividends or Distributions with Respect to Parent Stock. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Shares with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the Parent Shares
issuable to such holder hereunder, and all such dividends and other distributions, if any, shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu of such Certificate as provided in
Section 2.2(e)) or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate (or an
affidavit of loss in lieu of such Certificate as provided in Section 2.2(e)) or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest,
(i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and with a payment date prior to such surrender with respect
to the Parent Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such Parent Shares.

2.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but subject to the provisions of this Section 2.3),
Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented
thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand, and has properly demanded, appraisal for such Company Shares in accordance with, and who complies
in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Company Shares, the “Dissenting Shares”) shall

not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration or the Dividend Consideration. At the Effective
Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the rights granted to them
under the DGCL. If any such holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal under Section 262
of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be
exchangeable, subject to compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b), solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, the Fractional Share
Consideration and the Dividend Consideration, as applicable, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law.

2.4 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase a
Company Share granted under any Company Equity Plan (each, a “Company Stock Option”) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Cash
Election Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.1(c)) over the exercise price per Company Share of such Company
Stock Option and (ii) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each award in respect of a
Company Share subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restriction granted under a Company Equity Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each, a “Company Restricted Stock Award”) shall be assumed by Parent and substituted with an award of restricted Parent Shares
issued under a Parent Equity Plan (a “Parent Restricted Stock Award”) corresponding to a number of whole Parent Shares (rounded to the nearest whole
share) equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Restricted Stock Award as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (assuming that any performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Award are fully achieved) and
(ii) the Stock Election Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.1(c)). Except as otherwise set forth in this
Section 2.4(b), each Parent Restricted Stock Award issued pursuant to this Section 2.4(b) shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same vesting
and acceleration of vesting terms and conditions (other than any performance-based vesting conditions) as, and other terms and conditions that are
substantially similar to, those that applied to the corresponding Company Restricted Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each restricted stock unit award
or deferred stock unit award in respect of Company Shares granted under a Company Equity Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, a “Company RSU Award” and, together with the Company Stock Options and the Company Restricted Stock Awards, the “Company Equity
Awards”) and that is held by an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be assumed by Parent and substituted with a restricted stock
unit award to be settled in Parent Shares issued under a Parent Equity Plan (a “Parent RSU Award”) corresponding to a number of whole Parent Shares
(rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares underlying such Company RSU Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time (assuming that any performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such Company RSU Award are achieved at target
levels) and (ii) the Stock Election Consideration (before giving effect to any adjustment pursuant to Section 2.1(c)). Except as otherwise provided in this
Section 2.4(c), each Parent RSU Award issued pursuant to this Section 2.4(c) shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same vesting and
acceleration of vesting terms and conditions (other than any performance-based vesting conditions) as, and other terms and conditions that are
substantially similar to, those that applied to the corresponding Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each Company RSU Award held
by a non-employee director of the Company shall fully vest (to the

extent unvested) and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive the Cash Election Consideration (before giving effect to any
adjustment pursuant to Section 2.1(c)) in respect of each Company Share underlying such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(e) The Surviving Corporation shall pay, through the Surviving Corporation’s standard payroll procedures, the cash amounts described in
this Section 2.4, less applicable Tax withholdings, on the next regularly scheduled payroll date following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, to the extent that payment of the amounts described in this Section 2.4 with respect to Company Equity Awards that
constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code would otherwise cause the imposition of a Tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make such payment at the earliest time permitted under the Company Equity
Plan and applicable award agreement that would not result in the imposition of such Tax or penalty.

(f) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company or the compensation committee thereof, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.4.

(g) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent, the Parent Board or the compensation committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.4. At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume all the
obligations of the Company with respect to the Company Restricted Stock Awards and Company RSU Awards that are converted into Parent Restricted
Stock Awards and Parent RSU Awards, respectively, and the award agreements evidencing the grants thereof. Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of Parent Shares for delivery upon the vesting or settlement of the Parent Restricted Stock Awards
and Parent RSU Awards in accordance with this Section 2.4. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, if and to the extent necessary to
cause a sufficient number of Parent Shares to be registered and issuable under the Parent RSU Awards, Parent shall file a post-effective amendment to
the Form S-4 or a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the Parent Shares subject to Parent
RSU Awards and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Parent RSU Awards remain outstanding.

2.5 Withholding Rights. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Company and the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts that Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Company or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to
the applicable Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

2.6 Further Actions. As of the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name
and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

2.7 Fractional Shares. No fractional Parent Shares shall be issued in connection with the Merger, no certificate or scrip representing fractional
Parent Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each

holder of Company Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Share (after
aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender
of any right thereto, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to the Fractional Share Consideration.

2.8 Election Procedures. Each holder of record of Company Shares (other than Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) (each, a “Holder”) shall
have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 2, to submit an election on or prior to the Election Deadline in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 2.8.

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.8 (an “Election”) (i) the number of
Company Shares owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Mixed Election, (ii) the number of such Company Shares
with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election, (iii) the number of Company Shares owned by such Holder with respect to which
such Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (iv) the particular shares for which such Holder desires to make any such election, and the order in
which either such election is to apply to any such shares if the election is subject to proration under Section 2.1(c).

(b) The Company shall prepare a form of election reasonably acceptable to Parent (the “Form of Election”), which shall be mailed by the
Company to Holders so as to permit such Holders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline.

(c) The Company shall mail or cause to be mailed or delivered, as applicable, the Form of Election to Holders as of the record date for the
Company Stockholders Meeting not less than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline. The Company shall make available
one or more Forms of Election as may reasonably be requested from time to time by all Persons who become Holders during the period following the
record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting and prior to the Election Deadline.

(d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, by the Election Deadline, a Form of
Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by (i) the Certificates, if any, to which such Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank
or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(e)),
and (ii) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, any additional documents specified in the procedures set forth in the Form of Election. As used herein, unless
otherwise agreed in advance by the parties, “Election Deadline” means 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that the Parties shall agree is as near
as practicable to two (2) Business Days preceding the Closing Date.

(e) Any Holder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or revoke such Holder’s Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed revised Form of Election or by withdrawal prior to the
Election Deadline of such Holder’s Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificates as provided in Section 2.2(e)), or any documents in
respect of Book-Entry Shares, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. After an Election is validly made with respect to any Company Shares,
any subsequent transfer of such Company Shares shall automatically revoke such Election. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
all Elections shall be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of written notification from the Company or Parent that this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article 7. The Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine if any Election is not
properly made, changed or revoked with respect to any Company Shares (none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent being under
any duty to notify any Company shareholder of any applicable defect). In the event the Exchange Agent makes a determination that an Election was not
properly made, such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the Company Shares covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be
deemed to be Mixed Consideration Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made with respect to such shares.

ARTICLE 3
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in (i) the Company SEC Documents filed on or after January 1, 2016 and publicly available prior to the date hereof
(other than any disclosures contained under the captions “Risk Factors” or “Forward-Looking Statements,” and any other disclosures that are predictive,
cautionary or forward-looking in nature but, for the purpose of clarification, including and giving effect to any factual or historical statements included
in any such statements), but it being understood that this clause (i) shall not be applicable to Sections 3.2(a), 3.2(b) or 3.2(c) or (ii) the corresponding
sections of the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the “Company
Disclosure Letter”) (it being acknowledged and agreed that disclosure in any Section or Subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosed with respect to all sections of this Agreement and all other sections or subsections of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent that the
relevance of such disclosure to such other Section or subsection is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

(a) The Company is a corporation, duly organized and validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of Delaware and has requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the
Company’s Subsidiaries (each, a “Company Subsidiary”) is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
(with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has requisite
corporate or organizational, as the case may be, power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it
is now being conducted, in each case, except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its “significant subsidiaries” (as defined in Regulation S-X promulgated under the Securities Act) (each, a
“Significant Company Subsidiary”) is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in
each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company has made available or caused to be made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of (i) any amendments to
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the “Company Charter”) not filed prior to the date hereof with the SEC, (ii) any amendments
to the Bylaws of the Company (the “Company Bylaws”) not filed prior to the date hereof with the SEC and (iii) the certificates of incorporation and
bylaws, or equivalent organizational or governing documents, of each Significant Company Subsidiary. The Company is in compliance in all material
respects with the provisions of the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws.

(c) Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the date hereof a true, correct and complete list of the Company
Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of organization or incorporation, as the case may be, of each Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, owns any Equity Interest in any Person other than the Company Subsidiaries. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each Company Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable. Except as set forth in Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each Company Subsidiary are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens.

in accordance with its terms (except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar
Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, and to general equitable principles, including specific performance and injunctive

3.4 No Conflict. None of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement will (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), directly or indirectly, conflict
with or violate any provision of the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws. Except as would not have or reasonably be expected to have,

respective properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to any Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is a party or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or affected or any Company Permit.

the absence of notes and except as may be indicated in the notes thereto).

(c) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any “off balance
sheet arrangements” (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC), where the purpose or intended effect of such arrangement
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any Company Subsidiary in the Company SEC

Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company
(a) maintains in all material respects “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are
designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to
the Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports and (b) based on its most recent
evaluation of internal controls prior to the date hereof, has disclosed to the Company’s auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize

4.1 Organization and Qualification.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and has requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now

Merger Sub is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction where
the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or assets or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Parent has provided to the Company true, correct and complete copies of (i) any amendments to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation
of the Company (the “Parent Charter”) not filed prior to the date hereof with the SEC and (ii) the By-laws of Parent and any amendments thereto (the

4.19 Financing.

(a) Parent is a party to and has accepted a fully executed commitment letter dated June 7, 2018 (as the same may be amended or replaced, in
each case in accordance with Section 5.13(a), the “Commitment Letter”) from the lenders party thereto (collectively, the “Lenders”) pursuant to which
the Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide debt financing in the amounts set forth therein. The debt financing
committed pursuant to the Commitment Letter is collectively referred to in this Agreement as the “Financing.”

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of the executed Commitment Letter and any fee letters related
thereto, subject, in the case of such fee letters, to redaction solely of fee, pricing, “price flex” and other economic provisions that could not reasonably be
expect to affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability or principal amount of the Financing.

(c) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders to provide the
Financing in the amount contemplated by the Commitment Letter. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(a) and 6.2(b),
Parent does not have any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in the
Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Parent have knowledge that any of the Lenders will not perform its obligations thereunder.
As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters, understandings or other agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind relating to the
Financing that could affect the conditionality, enforceability, principal amount or availability of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter.

(d) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.2(a) and 6.2(b), the Financing, when funded in accordance with the
terms of the Commitment Letter, together with available cash of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries and
Merger Sub, will provide Parent with net cash proceeds on the Closing Date sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligations
under this Agreement and under the Commitment Letter, including the payment of the cash portion of the Merger Consideration, any fees and expenses
of or payable by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, any payments in respect of equity compensation obligations to be made in connection
with the Merger, and any repayment or refinancing of any outstanding indebtedness of Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries
contemplated by, or required in connection with the transactions described in, this Agreement or the Commitment Letter (such amounts, collectively, the
“Merger Amounts”).

(e) The Commitment Letter constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of all the parties thereto and is in full force and effect (except
as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting

creditors’ rights, and to general equitable principles, including specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief). As of the date
hereof, no event has occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition by Parent
under the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter, and Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will
not be satisfied by Parent on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the date of the Closing. Parent has paid in full any and
all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letter on or before the date of this Agreement, and will
pay in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, (i) the Commitment Letter has not been modified, amended or
altered, (ii) none of the respective commitments thereunder has been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and (iii) to the Knowledge of Parent, no
modification or amendment to the Commitment Letter is currently contemplated (except any modification or amendment solely to the extent necessary
to add lenders, lead arrangers, book-runners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this
Agreement (including in replacement of a Lender)).

(f) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Financing) by Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of Parent’s or Merger Sub’s obligations
under this Agreement.

4.20 Solvency. On the Closing Date, immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger and any financing being entered into by Parent or Merger Sub in connection therewith) and the payment of all related fees and
expenses, and assuming the satisfaction of the conditions in Sections 6.1 and 6.2:

(a) the Fair Value of the assets of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, shall exceed their Liabilities;

(b) the Present Fair Saleable Value of the assets of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, shall exceed their Liabilities;

(c) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, shall be able to pay their Liabilities as they mature; and

(d) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, shall not be left with unreasonably small capital to carry on its businesses
and all businesses in which it is about to engage.

For purposes of this Section 4.20, the following terms have the following meanings:

(i) “Fair Value” means the amount at which the assets (both tangible and intangible), in their entirety, of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries,
on a consolidated basis, would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, within a commercially reasonable period of time, each
having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts, with neither being under any compulsion to act.

(ii) “Liabilities” means the recorded liabilities (including contingent liabilities that would be recorded in accordance with GAAP) of Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries taken as a whole, as of the Closing Date immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any financing being entered into in connection therewith), determined in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied. For purposes of this definition, the amount of any contingent liability at any time shall be computed as the amount that would
reasonably be expected to become an actual and matured liability.

(iii) “Present Fair Saleable Value” means the amount that could be obtained by an independent willing seller from an independent willing
buyer if the assets of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are sold with reasonable promptness in an arm’s-length
transaction under present conditions for the sale of comparable business enterprises insofar as such conditions can be reasonably evaluated.

that it has not changed the Company Board Recommendation as of the date of such statement, shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation.

(h) Notwithstanding any provision of Section 5.3(a) to the contrary, the Company shall not grant any waiver or release under, or fail to
enforce, any standstill or similar agreement; provided, however, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may
grant a waiver or release under any standstill agreement, or any provision of any confidentiality or similar agreement with similar effect, (i) if the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law or (ii) in response to an Acquisition Proposal made under such circumstances
in which the Company is permitted under this Section 5.3 to participate in discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal, but only to the extent
necessary to allow it to pursue or consummate such Acquisition Proposal, subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 5.3. The Company shall
provide written notice to Parent of waiver or release of any standstill by the Company, including disclosure of the identities of the parties thereto and a
summary of the material circumstances relating thereto. Except for the waiver or release of any standstill, or any provision of any confidentiality or
similar agreement with similar effect, as contemplated by this Section 5.3(h), the Company shall not release or permit the release of any Person from, or
amend, waive, terminate or modify, and shall not permit the amendment, waiver, termination or modification of, any provision of, any confidentiality or
similar agreement or provision to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or under which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
has any rights. The Company shall not, and shall instruct and use commercially reasonable efforts to not permit any Company Representative (on the
Company’s behalf) to, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement subsequent to the date of this Agreement that prohibits the Company from
providing to Parent the information specifically required to be provided to Parent pursuant to this Section 5.3.

consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii) take all such
actions (if any) as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods under Competition Laws with respect to such transactions as promptly as

authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to effect the Closing as

Governmental Entity or any other Person, in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and (B) from any Third Party any consents or notices that are required to be obtained or made
by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in

nonappealable Order, (vi) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order that may adversely affect the ability of the parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case until the issuance of a final, nonappealable Order, (vii) prepare and file as promptly as

clearances necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Third Party or any Governmental Entity to consummate the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (viii) take all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain all such consents and approvals, and (ix) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any fees due in
connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under any other applicable Law; provided, however, that in no event shall
anything in this Agreement require, or be construed to require, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates, or permit the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective affiliates, to (A) undertake any efforts, or to take or consent to any action, including
those described in this Section 5.4(a), if such efforts, action or consent, individually or in the aggregate, would result in a material adverse effect on the
business, condition (financial or otherwise), assets or results of operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, prior to the
Effective Time, (B) take any actions, including the actions described in this Section 5.4(a), with respect to Parent, its affiliates or their respective assets,
categories of assets, businesses, relationships, contractual rights, obligations or arrangements or (C) take or agree to take any action with respect to its

conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing.

No party to this Agreement shall consent to any delay of the Closing at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other parties to
this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub shall not, except as may be consented to in advance in writing by the Company, directly or indirectly through
one or more of its affiliates, acquire any Person or material assets thereof or interest therein, if such acquisition would reasonably be expected to cause a
delay beyond the Outside Date or prevent the consummation of the Merger.

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 5.4, each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties prompt notice
of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) keep the other parties notified as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or other Proceeding, (iii) promptly notify the other parties of any oral or written communication to or from any Governmental
Entity regarding the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) promptly provide to the other parties copies of any
written communications received or provided by such party, or any of its Subsidiaries, from or to any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or
any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that Parent and the Company may, as each reasonably and in good faith deems
advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section as “Antitrust Counsel Only Material.”
Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by
such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Each party hereto will consult and cooperate with the other parties with
respect to and provide any necessary information and assistance as the other parties may reasonably request with respect to all notices, submissions, or
filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement or any transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will permit the other parties to review and discuss in
advance and consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any applicable Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation,
action or other Proceeding other than the matters contemplated by Section 5.11, in connection with or related to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, each party hereto will consult with the other parties in advance and give the other parties or their authorized representatives the
opportunity to be present at each meeting or teleconference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or other Proceeding and to have access
to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or other

Proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent and Company shall jointly control all aspects of the parties’ efforts to gain
regulatory clearance either before any Governmental Entity or in any action brought to enjoin the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to any
Competition Law, and shall consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another in doing so

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations
of the Company prior to the consummation of the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, control over its business operations.

5.5 Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meetings.

(a) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in preparing, and as promptly as reasonably practicable (but no later than thirty-five (35) days)
following the date hereof, file the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Form S-4. The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included in and will constitute a
part of the Form S-4. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Subject to Sections 5.3(d) and 5.3(e) and the other applicable terms of this
Agreement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation and also include, in their entirety, the Fairness Opinions,
together with summaries thereof. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent, to have the Form S-4 declared
effective by the SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective through the Closing in order to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Parent shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance and reservation
of Parent Shares in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of Company Shares, or holders
of a beneficial interest therein, as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Each of Parent or the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other parties with copies of any written comments, and advise each other of any oral comments, with
respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 received from the SEC. Parent and the Company shall cooperate and provide each other with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 prior to filing
such with the SEC, and shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments thereon made by the other party or its counsel, and will
provide each other with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Subject to Section 5.3(g), but notwithstanding any other provision herein to the
contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 shall be made
without providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and without the parties consulting and cooperating with one
another, and considering in good faith the view of one another in doing so (provided, that, without limiting the foregoing, no amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be made without the approval of both the Company and Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company and such information should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party hereto discovering such information shall promptly notify the other parties and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations,
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company in accordance with applicable Law.

(b) The Company shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as
practicable following the declaration of effectiveness of the Form S-4 by the SEC for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. The
record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting shall be determined by the Company with prior consultation with Parent; provided, that the
Company shall not change the date of (or the record date for), postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders

Meeting without the consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), provided, however, that the
Company shall (i) be entitled to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting on one or more occasions without the prior consent of Parent
and (ii) shall postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting on one or more occasions if so requested by Parent, in each case, if, on the date
for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is then scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Company
Shares to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present.

(c) The Company Board shall, except in the case of a Change of Board Recommendation made in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, recommend the adoption of this Agreement by the Company stockholders to the effect as set forth in Section 3.3, and, subject to
Section 5.3, shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Change in Board Recommendation
pursuant to Section 5.3, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, this Agreement shall be submitted to the Company’s
stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation. The
Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, during the last seven (7) Business Days prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting,
request its proxy solicitor to advise Parent at least one (1) time each Business Day as to the aggregate tally of proxies received by the Company with
respect to the Company Stockholder Approval. Without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unconditionally withheld, delayed or
conditioned), and except as required by applicable Law or the rules and regulations of NASDAQ, the adoption of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other than procedural matters) that the Company shall propose to be acted on by
the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

5.6 Public Announcements. So long as this Agreement is in effect, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, shall
not, and shall cause their respective controlled affiliates not to, issue any press release or make any public statement with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as
may be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to
which the relevant party is subject, in which case, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and practicable under the circumstances, the party
proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall consult in good faith with the other party before making any such public
announcement, (b) with respect to any press release or other public statement by the Company permitted by Section 5.3 or (c) statements consistent in
all material respects with any release, disclosure or other public statement previously made in accordance with this Section 5.6. The press release
announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of, and shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of, the
Company and Parent.

5.7 Employee Benefit Matters.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all Benefit Plans in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each Person who is employed by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time who continues in the employ of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective affiliates on or after the Effective Time (“Company
Employees”) (i) a base salary or wage rate and short-term incentive cash compensation opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than were
provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) all other compensation and employee benefits that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided to the Company Employee immediately before the Effective Time.

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and for calculating severance and vacation entitlements under the employee benefit
plans of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries (each, a “New Plan”), each

Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors
before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that
the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (A) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the
extent that coverage under such New Plans is comparable to a Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old Plans”) and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all eligibility waiting periods, pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the comparable Old Plans, and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans ending on the date such
employee’s participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Parent hereby acknowledges that a “change in control” (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Benefit Plans will occur at the
Effective Time.

(d) The Company may implement a retention program in accordance with Section 5.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other Person any right to continue in the employ or service of
the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates. Except as expressly set forth in this
Section 5.7, no provision of this Agreement: (i) shall limit the ability of the Company or any of its affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate in accordance with its terms any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them, (ii) shall be deemed or construed
to amend, establish, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement or (iii) create any third party
beneficiary rights or obligations in any person (including any current or former service provider or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof)) or any right to employment or continued employment or to a particular term or condition of employment with the
Company or any of its affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries).

5.8 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless all past
and present directors, officers and employees of the Company or each Company Subsidiary (collectively, the “Covered Persons”) to the same extent
such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational or governing documents, of any Company Subsidiary and indemnification agreements, if any,
in existence on the date of this Agreement with any directors, officers and employees and made available to Parent (collectively, the “Existing
Indemnification Agreements”), in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as
directors or officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless the Covered Persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law for acts or
omissions occurring in connection

with the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to advance expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any Proceeding or investigation with respect
to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.8 in accordance with the procedures (if any) set forth in the Company Charter, the
Company Bylaws, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or equivalent organizational documents, of any Company Subsidiary, and any Existing
Indemnification Agreements; provided, that the applicable Covered Person provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it is ultimately determined
by a final non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Covered Person is not entitled to indemnification under this Section 5.8 or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Proceeding (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against
such persons with respect to matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions
of this Section 5.8 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such Proceeding or investigation.

(b) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification of and advancement of expenses to Covered Persons for periods
at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws. Following the Effective Time, the
Existing Indemnification Agreements shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without any further action, and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms.

(c) For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain for the benefit of the directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as
of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to
the Effective Time (the “D&O Insurance”) that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing
policies of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (true and complete copies of which have been previously made available to Parent) or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as is available for such amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, which policies shall be approved by Parent and
provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of at least six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in connection with the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder.

(d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in
each case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.

(e) The obligations under this Section 5.8 shall not be terminated or modified in any manner that is adverse to the Covered Persons (and
their respective successors and assigns); it being expressly agreed that the Covered Persons (including successors and assigns) shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.8. In the event of any breach by the Surviving Corporation or Parent of this Section 5.8, the Surviving Corporation shall
pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that may be incurred by Covered Persons in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this Section 5.8 as such fees are incurred upon the written request of such Covered Person.

5.9 Takeover Statutes. If any state takeover Law or state Law that purports to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire or
vote Shares (including any “control share acquisition,” “fair price,” “moratorium,” “business combination” or other similar takeover Law) becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, this Agreement, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
then Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate and take all action reasonably available to render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.
Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor the Company will take any action that would cause this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to be subject to the requirements imposed by any such Laws.

5.10 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall
adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
“covered person” of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (“Section 16”) of Company
Shares and Company Equity Awards pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

5.11 Stockholder Litigation. The parties shall cooperate and consult with one another in connection with any Proceeding by the Company’s
stockholders against the Company or any of its directors, officers or affiliates with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
and the Company shall give Parent notice of any such Proceeding as promptly as practicable. The Company shall not compromise or settle any
Proceeding commenced against it or its directors, officers or affiliates relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the

the Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger and such other Parent Shares to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Merger to be approved for
listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance. The Company shall cooperate with Parent in connection with the foregoing, including by
providing information reasonably requested by Parent in connection therewith. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ to cause the delisting of the Company and of the Company Shares from NASDAQ as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Company Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after
such delisting.

5.13 Financing and Financing Cooperation.

(a) Each of Parent and Intermediate Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or use reasonable best efforts to cause to be taken all
actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, advisable or proper to obtain the proceeds of the Financing prior to the date upon which the
Merger is required to be consummated pursuant to the terms hereof, including by using reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment
Letter, (ii) negotiate definitive agreements (which, with respect to the bridge facility documentation, shall not be required until reasonably necessary in
connection with the funding of the Financing) with respect to the Financing (the “Definitive Agreements”) not less favorable to Parent, Intermediate
Parent and Merger Sub with respect to conditionality than the terms and conditions contained therein (including, as necessary, the “flex” provisions
contained in any related fee letter) and (iii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, seek the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions in the
Commitment Letter and the Definitive Agreements that are under its control and comply with its obligations thereunder. In the event that all conditions
contained in the Commitment Letter (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions to be taken at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) have been satisfied, Parent and Intermediate Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to enforce its rights
under the Commitment Letter and

the Definitive Documents in a timely and diligent manner to cause the Lenders to comply with their respective obligations thereunder, including to fund
the Financing.

(i) Neither Parent nor Intermediate Parent shall, nor shall they permit Merger Sub to, without the prior written consent of the
Company: (A) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter or Definitive
Agreements if such amendment, modification, waiver or remedy (1) adds new (or adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of
all or any portion of the Financing, (2) reduces the amount of the Financing, (3) adversely affects the ability of Parent or Intermediate Parent to enforce
its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof or (4) would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially delay
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, Parent may
amend the Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, book-runners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed such
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement, if the addition of such parties, individually or in the aggregate, does not add new (or adversely
modify any existing) conditions to the consummation of the Financing); or (B) terminate the Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement. Parent
and Intermediate Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement.

(ii) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, Parent will (A) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing in an amount sufficient, when taken together with available cash of Parent, the Parent
Subsidiaries, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the available portion of the Financing, to fund the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration and the other Merger Amounts (the “Alternate Financing”) from the same or other sources and which do not include any conditions to the
consummation of such alternative debt financing that are more onerous than the conditions set forth in the Financing and (B) promptly notify the
Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that (1) any portion of the
Financing or any financing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement structured as high yield or debt securities financing is
unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, (2) all conditions contained in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 have been satisfied or waived (other than
(x) any such conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing,
and (y) those conditions the failure of which to be satisfied is attributable to a breach by Parent, Intermediate Parent or Merger Sub of their
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement), (3) the Marketing Period shall have ended and (4) the bridge
facilities contemplated by the Commitment Letter (or alternative bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this Section 5.13) are available on the
terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter (or replacements thereof), then each of Parent, Intermediate Parent and Merger Sub shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause the proceeds of such bridge financing to be used immediately in lieu of such affected portion of the high yield
financing. For the purposes of this Agreement, in the event any Alternate Financing is obtained and an alternate commitment letter (or similar
agreement) (the “Alternate Commitment Letter”) is entered into in compliance herewith, (A) any reference in this Agreement to “Financing” shall mean
the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to clause (B) below and any Definitive Agreements (including definitive
agreements relating to Alternate Financing), and (B) the term Commitment Letter (or defined terms that use such phrase) shall be deemed to include any
Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time in question and any Alternate Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect. Parent and Intermediate
Parent shall provide the Company with prompt notice of any material breach, material default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Commitment Letter or any Definitive Agreement and a copy of any written notice or other written communication from any Lender or other Alternate
Financing source with respect to any material breach, material default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or any
Definitive Agreement of any provision thereof. Upon request of the Company, Parent shall appraise the Company of developments relating to the
Financing. The foregoing notwithstanding, compliance by Parent and/or Merger Sub with this Section 5.13 shall not relieve Parent,

Company Subsidiaries, prior to the Closing, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Financing or any other financing of Parent in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable

Information provided to Parent as may be necessary so that such Required Information is (i) Compliant and (ii) meets the applicable requirements set

cooperation of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries under this Section 5.13 at any time, and from time to time and on multiple occasions,
between the date hereof and the Closing; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Marketing Period shall not be applicable as to each attempt to

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent reasonably requests the Company to file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the
Exchange Act that contains material non-public information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, which Parent reasonably
determines is necessary (after consultation with the Company) to include in customary offering materials for the Financing or any other financing in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in each case other than offering materials to be shared only with “private side”
investors that are subject to a confidentiality agreement), then, upon the Company’s review of and reasonable satisfaction with such filing, the Company

funds and cash collateralization, backstopping or replacement of letters of credit, in each case, as arranged by Parent) with respect to the Revolving
Credit Agreement (the “Subject Indebtedness”) in customary form (the “Payoff Letter”), which Payoff Letter shall (i) indicate the total amount required
to be paid to fully satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs and any other monetary obligations (other than
contingent indemnification obligations for which no claim has been made) then due and payable under the Subject Indebtedness as of the anticipated
Closing Date (and the daily accrual thereafter) (the “Payoff Amount”) (ii) state that upon receipt of the Payoff Amount under the Payoff Letter, the
Subject Indebtedness and all related loan documents shall be terminated (other than the terms thereof that expressly survive such termination in
accordance with the terms of such documents) and (iii) provide that all guarantees of any of the Company Subsidiaries of the Subject Indebtedness and,
to the extent secured, all Liens securing obligations in respect of the Subject Indebtedness shall be released and terminated upon payment of the Payoff
Amount and the cash collateralization, backstopping or replacement of any outstanding letters of credit (which cash collateralization, backstopping,
replacement shall be arranged by Parent) on the Closing Date. At the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall repay the outstanding amount of the
Subject Indebtedness by wire transfer of immediately available funds arranged by Parent as provided for in the Payoff Letter.

outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 6.625% Senior Notes due 2022 issued by the Company prior to the date hereof pursuant to the Indenture
(the “Senior Notes”) identified by Parent to the Company in writing prior to, on, or after the date hereof on terms that are acceptable to Parent; provided,
that any such Debt Offer shall be consummated using funds provided by Parent. Parent shall not be permitted to commence any applicable Debt Offer
until Parent shall have provided the Company with the necessary offer to purchase, offer to exchange, consent solicitation statement, letter of transmittal
and press release, if any, in connection therewith and each other document relevant to such transaction that will be distributed by Parent to holders of the
Senior Notes in the applicable Debt Offer (collectively, the “Debt Offer Documents”) a period of time in advance of commencing the applicable Debt
Offer to allow the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the related Debt Offer Documents. Parent will
reasonably consult with the Company regarding the material terms and conditions of any Debt Offer (other than financial terms), including the timing
and commencement of any Debt Offer and any relevant tender or consent deadlines. The closing (or, if applicable, effectiveness) of the Debt Offers shall
be expressly conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent, at Parent’s
request, to facilitate the initial settlement of the Debt Offers by Parent on the Closing Date; provided, that the consummation of a Debt Offer with
respect to the Senior Notes shall not be a condition to Closing. The Debt Offers shall be conducted in compliance with (and the terms of any Debt Offer
shall comply with) the Indenture and SEC Regulatory Requirements, and the Company shall not be required to cooperate with respect to any Debt Offer
that is not in compliance with the Senior Notes, the Indenture and SEC Regulatory Requirements. Subject to Section 5.13(b), at Parent’s expense, the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and their respective representatives to, in each case, use their reasonable best efforts to
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Offer; provided that prior to the Closing, neither the Company nor
any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor counsel for the Company shall be required to furnish any officer’s certificates, legal opinions or negative
assurance letters in connection with the Debt Offers (other than, in connection with the execution of a supplemental indenture relating to any consent
solicitation of the type described in clause (ii) below, the Company delivering customary officer’s certificates, and using reasonable best efforts to cause
counsel for the Company to deliver customary legal opinions, respectively, to the trustee under the Indenture, to the extent such certificates and opinions
would not (in the opinion of the Company, its counsel and the Trustee) conflict with applicable Laws, the terms of the Senior Notes or the Indenture and
would be accurate in light of the facts and circumstances at the time delivered) or execute any other instruments or agreements in connection therewith
other than the supplemental indenture described in clause (ii) below. To the extent that the provisions of SEC Regulatory Requirements conflict with this
Section 5.14(b)(i), Parent and the Company shall comply with SEC Regulatory Requirements and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations
under this Agreement by such compliance. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company or its legal
counsel be required to give an opinion with respect to the Financing or any other financing of Parent or Merger Sub.

(ii) To the extent any Debt Offer includes a consent solicitation, then subject to the receipt of the requisite consents, the Company
and the applicable Company Subsidiaries shall execute a supplemental indenture to the Indenture in accordance with the terms of the Indenture,
amending the terms and provisions of the Indenture as described in the relevant Debt Offer Documents as reasonably requested by Parent, which
supplemental indenture shall become operative no earlier than the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or any of its
officers, directors or other representatives have any obligation to authorize, adopt or execute any amendments or other agreement that is not permitted
under applicable Law, the terms of the Senior Notes or the Indenture or would become operative prior to the Effective Time.

7.3 Termination Fee.

(a) The parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated by Parent in accordance with Section 7.1(e) or by the Company in accordance with
Section 7.1(f), then the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) to Intermediate Parent (or its designee) prior to or concurrently with such termination,
in the case of a termination by the Company, or within two (2) Business Days thereafter, in the case of a termination by Parent, a termination fee equal
to eighteen million four hundred seventy-two thousand dollars ($18,472,000) (the “Termination Fee”); provided, however, that in the event the
Termination Fee becomes payable as a result of the termination of this Agreement prior to the Window Period End Time (i) by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(e) in response to a Change of Board Recommendation effected in compliance with Section 5.3(d) with respect to a Superior Proposal by a
Qualified Bidder or (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(f) with respect to a Superior Proposal by a Qualified Bidder, then, in the case of either
of the immediately preceding clauses (i) or (ii), “Termination Fee” means an amount equal to ten million dollars ($10,000,000).

(b) The parties agree that (i) if (A) this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(g) and, prior to the date of such
termination, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal is (1) made public by the Company or any other Person and (2) not withdrawn or (B) this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 7.1(d) and, prior to the date of completion of the Company Stockholders Meeting, a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal is (1) made public by the Company or any other Person and (2) not withdrawn and (ii) within twelve (12) months after such termination, the
Company (A) enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any such Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal is subsequently
consummated, or (B) consummates any such Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) the Termination Fee to
Intermediate Parent (or its designee), no later than two (2) Business Days after the consummation of such transaction, as applicable. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Company shall not be obligated to pay the Termination Fee with respect to any Acquisition Proposal unless such Acquisition Proposal is
consummated. For purposes of this Section 7.3(b), the term “Acquisition Proposal” shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 8.4, except
that the references to “20%” shall be deemed to be references to “50%.”

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreement contained in this Section 7.3 is an integral part of this Agreement and that, without this
Section 7.3, Merger Sub, Intermediate Parent and Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay
any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, the Company shall pay to Merger Sub all reasonable fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees as well as reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any action initiated by Parent, Intermediate Parent or Merger Sub),
together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, in effect on the date such
payment is made.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion.

(e) Subject to Parent’s and Merger Sub’s rights set forth in Section 8.14, if and to the extent the Termination Fee is required to be, and is in
fact, paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 7.3, Intermediate Parent’s (or its designee’s) right to receive payment thereof shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent, Intermediate Parent and Merger Sub against the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective former,
current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or affiliates (collectively, “Company Related Parties”) for any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, to be consummated or for a breach or failure
to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this

Agreement, including the Merger (except that the Company shall also be obligated with respect to Section 7.3(c) and except that the applicable
Company Related Parties shall remain obligated for, and Parent and Merger Sub may be entitled to remedies with respect to the provisions and
agreements surviving such termination pursuant to Section 7.2). For the avoidance of doubt, while Parent and Merger Sub may pursue, in the alternative,
both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 8.14 and the payment of the Termination Fee under Section 7.3, under no circumstances
shall Parent and Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and the Termination Fee.

7.4 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub by action taken by or on behalf of their
respective boards of directors; provided however, that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there may not be, without further

stockholders of the Company. This Agreement may not be amended, except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

7.5 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive any breach of the representations and warranties of the other
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other with any of the agreements or covenants contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but
such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or any rights arising out of any breach of any of the foregoing, shall survive the Effective Time,

being entered into in connection with this Agreement, which shall be deemed borne by Parent and Merger Sub) incurred by the parties hereto shall be

and (d) as provided in Section 8.15. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto without
notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the
parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto, and consequently, may not accurately
characterize actual facts or circumstances.

8.11 Mutual Drafting; Interpretation. Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the
result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if

provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
include masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words “include” and “including” and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to

Agreement to “Sections,” “Exhibits” and “Annexes” are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits and Annexes to this Agreement.
The Company Disclosure Letter and exhibits attached to this Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein for all purposes.
The words “hereof,” “hereto,” “hereby,” “herein,” “hereunder” and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement
as a whole and not to any particular Section or Article in which such words appear. All references in this Agreement to “$” are intended to refer to U.S.
dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term “or” shall not be deemed to be exclusive. Disclosure of any item on the Company
Disclosure Letter by reference to any particular Section or Subsection of this Agreement shall be deemed to constitute disclosure with respect to any
other Section or Subsection of this Agreement if the relevance of such disclosure to such other Section or Subsection is reasonably apparent from such
disclosure or the context in which such disclosure is made. Except as otherwise indicated, “made available” or terms of similar import mean made
available to Parent and its advisors in the electronic data room maintained by the Company for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement at least one (1) day prior to the date hereof.

Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the negotiation hereof in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement or

court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS

THEREBY (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCING). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO

hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue
of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by

terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and accordingly, (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to specific performance of the terms hereof, in each case in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, in any

member of the Company Board, and Parent shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, assert any claim that any action taken by the Stockholder

who is, a director, trustee, officer or other fiduciary of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of

Subject Shares, except as provided herein.

bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights
or by general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding at Law or in equity).

contemplated by this Agreement will (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), directly or indirectly, conflict with or violate any Law applicable

SECTION 6. Miscellaneous.

6.1 Expenses. Subject to any other agreement between the parties, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

6.2 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries.

(a) This Agreement, together with the Merger Agreement, constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided that if
there is any conflict between this Agreement and the Merger Agreement, this Agreement shall control.

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of
the parties hereto, and consequently, may not accurately characterize actual facts or circumstances.

6.3 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written
consent of the other party.

6.4 Amendment; No Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing between Parent and the
Stockholder. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of
such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. In addition, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement can be
discharged by any party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by such party and (b) no notice to
or demand on a party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party and no notice from or demand by a party will be deemed to be a
waiver of such party’s right to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement.

6.5 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled
to the extent possible.

6.6 Notices. Any notices or other communications required or permitted under, or otherwise given in connection with, this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) when delivered or sent if delivered in Person or sent by facsimile
transmission (provided confirmation of facsimile transmission is obtained and delivery is followed within one (1) Business Day by email pursuant to
clause (c) or delivered in Person), (b) on the next Business Day if transmitted by national overnight courier or (c) on the date delivered if sent by email
(provided that confirmation of email receipt is obtained; provided further that if such notice or other communication is also sent by another means
provided for by this Section 6.6 within one (1) Business Day after sending such email, such notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been

(a) This Agreement and all claims and causes of action arising in connection herewith shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws that may be applicable under conflicts of laws principles (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising in connection herewith or any claim or cause of action arising in connection with this Agreement or the negotiation hereof, and
any Proceeding for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by any other party hereto or its successors or assigns, will be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and
any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any
such Proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to or arising from this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the negotiation
hereof in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this
Section 6.7(b), (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the Law, any claim that (A) the Proceeding in such court is brought
in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such Proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced
in or by such courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 6.6 and agrees that service made in such manner shall have the same legal force and effect
as if served upon such party personally within the State of Delaware. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR

THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 6.7(c).

6.8 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that if any the provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be
difficult to determine, and accordingly, (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to specific performance of the terms hereof, in each case in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction,
in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
Law or in equity, (b) the parties waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any specific
performance or injunctive relief and (c) the parties will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law.
Either party’s pursuit of specific performance at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or
remedy to which such party may be entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by a party in the case
of a breach of this Agreement involving willful breach or fraud.

6.9 Mutual Drafting; Interpretation. Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party
acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement
shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa;
the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter
gender shall include masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words “include” and “including” and variations thereof, shall not
be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” Except as otherwise indicated, all
references in this Agreement to “Sections” are intended to refer to Sections of this Agreement. The words “hereof,” “hereto,” “hereby,” “herein,”
“hereunder” and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Section in
which such words appear. All references in this Agreement to “$” are intended to refer to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein,
the term “or” shall not be deemed to be exclusive.

6.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic
transmission each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This
Agreement shall become effective when Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholder, on the other hand, shall have received a counterpart hereof signed
by the other party hereto. Until and unless Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholder, on the other hand, shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any
other oral or written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic
transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

6.11 No Recourse. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) this Agreement may be enforced only against, and
any claim based upon, arising out of or related to a breach of this Agreement by the Stockholder may be made only against, the Stockholder in
accordance with the terms hereof, (ii) none of

the Stockholder’s affiliates or the Stockholder’s or its affiliates’ respective current, former or future directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members, general partners or limited partners, or representatives (collectively, the “Stockholder Related Parties”) shall have any liability for
the performance of any obligations of the Stockholder, for any claims (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) for breach of this Agreement or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith and (iii) Parent shall have no rights of recovery in respect of this
Agreement against any Stockholder Related Party, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through any claim (whether in
tort, contract or otherwise) by or on behalf of the Stockholder against any Stockholder Related Party, by the enforcement of any judgment, fine or
penalty or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable requirements of law, or otherwise. Any liability of the Stockholder for money damages
under this Agreement shall be satisfied solely out of the assets of the Stockholder. Without limiting the rights of any party against the other parties
hereto, in no event shall any party or any of its affiliates seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against,
or seek to recover monetary damages from, any Stockholder Related Party.

6.12 Other Stockholder Parties. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent acknowledges that certain of the
Stockholder’s affiliates and other platforms trade securities and syndicated bank debt and originate loans (including the provision of debt financing for
transactions similar to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement) and nothing herein shall restrict the ability of such affiliates (other than
the Stockholder) or platforms to trade securities (including Company Shares) and syndicated bank debt and originate loans in the ordinary course of
business.

6.13 Other Agreements. Nothing in this Agreement shall prejudice in any way the Stockholder’s or its affiliates’ rights pursuant to
the Management Agreement or the Stockholder’s Agreement; provided that if there is any conflict between this Agreement and the Stockholder’s
Agreement, this Agreement shall control. For clarity, the parties hereto agree that the Company will pay to the Manager (as defined in the Management
Agreement), at or prior to the Closing (as defined in the Merger Agreement), all unpaid Reimbursable Expenses and Monitoring Fees (each as defined in
the Management Agreement), and that the Management Agreement and the Stockholder’s Agreement shall terminate automatically upon the Closing
pursuant to their terms without any further action of the parties to the Merger Agreement and (i) the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and
their respective affiliates shall have no liability to the Stockholder thereunder following the Closing (other than with respect to the foregoing payment
obligations), and (ii) the Stockholder and its affiliates shall have no liability to the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and their respective
affiliates thereunder following the Closing.

6.14 Further Actions. From time to time, at the reasonable request of Parent and without further consideration, prior to the
termination of this Agreement, the Stockholder shall execute and deliver such additional documents and instruments and take all such further action as
may be reasonably required to consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.15 Certain Definitions.

(a) “beneficial ownership” means, with respect to any securities, the ownership of such security by any “beneficial owner” as
such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 adopted by the SEC under the Exchange Act. The terms “beneficial owner,” “beneficially own,” “beneficially
owned” and similar terms shall have a correlative meaning.

(b) “Constructive Disposition” means, with respect to any Subject Shares, a short sale with respect to such security, entering
into or acquiring a derivative contract with respect to such security, entering into or acquiring a futures or forward contract to deliver such security
or entering into any other hedging or other derivative, swap, “put-call,” margin, securities lending or other transaction that has or reasonably
would be expected to have the effect of changing, limiting, arbitraging or reallocating the economic benefits and risks of ownership of such
security.

manner as the Stockholder and be subject to the restrictions applicable to the Stockholder and otherwise become a party for all purposes of this

June 6, 2018

The Board of Directors
AV Homes, Inc.
6730 N. Scottsdale Road
Scottsdale, AZ 85253

Members of the Board of Directors:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the
“Company Common Stock”), of AV Homes, Inc. (the “Company”) of the consideration to be paid to such holders in the proposed merger (the
“Transaction”) of the Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger Sub”) of Taylor Morrison Home Corporation (the “Acquiror”). Pursuant
to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”) among the Company, the Acquiror, an intermediate parent company of the Merger Sub (solely
for purposes of Section 7.3 thereof) and the Merger Sub, the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Acquiror, and each outstanding
share of Company Common Stock, other than shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury or owned by the Acquiror and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries and wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company and Dissenting Shares (as defined in the Agreement), will be converted into the right to
receive, at the election of the holder thereof, (i) 0.979 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (“Acquiror Common Stock”), of
Acquiror (the “Stock Election Consideration”), (ii) $21.50 in cash (the “Cash Election Consideration”) or (iii) a combination of (A) $12.64 in cash and
(B) 0.4034 shares of Acquiror Common Stock (the “Mixed Election Consideration”), subject to certain proration procedures as set forth in the
Agreement (as to which we express no view or opinion). The aggregate Stock Election Consideration, Cash Election Consideration and Mixed Election
Consideration in the Transaction is referred to as the “Consideration.”

In connection with preparing our opinion, we have (i) reviewed a draft of the Agreement dated June 6, 2018; (ii) reviewed certain publicly available
business and financial information concerning the Company and the industries in which it operates; (iii) compared the proposed financial terms of the
Transaction with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions involving companies we deemed relevant and the consideration paid for
such companies; (iv) compared the financial and operating performance of the Company with publicly available information concerning certain other
companies we deemed relevant and reviewed the current and historical market prices of the Company Common Stock and certain publicly traded
securities of such other companies; (v) reviewed certain internal financial analyses and forecasts prepared by or at the direction of the management of
the Company relating to the business of the Company and (vi) performed such other financial studies and analyses and considered such other
information as we deemed appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.

In addition, we have held discussions with certain members of the management of the Company with respect to certain aspects of the Transaction, and
the past and current business operations of the Company, the financial condition and future prospects and operations of the Company, the effects of the
Transaction on the financial condition and future prospects of the Company, and certain other matters we believed necessary or appropriate to our
inquiry.

In giving our opinion, we have relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all information that was publicly available or was furnished
to or discussed with us by the Company or otherwise reviewed by or for us. We have not independently verified any such information or its accuracy or
completeness and, pursuant to our engagement letter with the Company, we did not assume any obligation to undertake any such independent
verification. We have not conducted or been provided with any valuation or appraisal of any assets or liabilities,

nor have we evaluated the solvency of the Company or the Acquiror under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters. In relying on financial analyses and forecasts provided to us or derived therefrom, we have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared
based on assumptions reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments by management as to the expected future results of operations and
financial condition of the Company to which such analyses or forecasts relate. We express no view as to such analyses or forecasts or the assumptions
on which they were based. We have also assumed that the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement will have the tax
consequences described in materials furnished to us by, representatives of the Company, and will be consummated as described in the Agreement, and
that the definitive Agreement will not differ in any material respects from the draft thereof furnished to us. We have also assumed that the
representations and warranties made by the Company, the Acquiror and the Merger Sub in the Agreement and the related agreements are and will be true
and correct in all respects material to our analysis. We are not legal, regulatory or tax experts and have relied on the assessments made by advisors to the
Company with respect to such issues. We have further assumed that all material governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for
the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or the Acquiror or on the contemplated benefits of the
Transaction.

Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date
hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and that we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or
reaffirm this opinion. Our opinion is limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company
Common Stock in the proposed Transaction and we express no opinion as to the fairness of any consideration paid in connection with the Transaction to
the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or as to the underlying decision by the Company to engage
in the Transaction. Furthermore, we express no opinion with respect to the amount or nature of any compensation to any officers, directors, or
employees of any party to the Transaction, or any class of such persons relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company Common
Stock in the Transaction or with respect to the fairness of any such compensation. Our opinion does not address (i) the allocation of the Consideration as
between holders of Company Common Stock who receive the Stock Election Consideration, the Cash Election Consideration or the Mixed Election
Consideration or (ii) the relative fairness of the Stock Election Consideration, the Cash Election Consideration and the Mixed Election Consideration.
We are expressing no opinion herein as to the price at which the Company Common Stock or the Acquiror Common Stock will trade at any future time.

We have acted as financial advisor to the Company with respect to the proposed Transaction and will receive a fee from the Company for our services, a
substantial portion of which will become payable only if the proposed Transaction is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify
us for certain liabilities arising out of our engagement. During the two years preceding the date of this letter, we and our affiliates have had commercial
or investment banking relationships with the Company, the Acquiror and TPG Partner Holdings, LP (“TPG”) and certain of its affiliates, for which we
and such affiliates have received customary compensation. Such services during such period have included acting as joint lead arranger and bookrunner
on the Company’s revolving credit facility which closed in May 2017, joint lead bookrunner on the Company’s offering of securities which closed in
May 2017, joint lead bookrunner on the Acquiror’s offerings of equity securities which closed in May 2017 and January 2017, joint lead arranger and
bookrunner on TPG’s revolving credit facility which closed in May 2018, joint lead bookrunner on an affiliate of TPG’s offering of equity securities
which closed in March 2018, joint lead bookrunner on an affiliate of TPG’s offering of debt securities which closed in January 2018 and joint lead
bookrunner on an affiliate of TPG’s offering of equity securities which closed in June 2017. In addition, our commercial banking affiliate is an agent
bank and a lender under outstanding credit facilities of the Company and certain affiliates of TPG, for which it receives customary compensation or
other financial benefits. In addition, we and our affiliates hold, on a proprietary basis, less than 1% of the outstanding common stock of each of the
Company and the Acquiror. In the ordinary course of our businesses, we and our affiliates may actively trade the debt and equity securities or financial
instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of the Company or the Acquiror for our own account or for the accounts of
customers and, accordingly, we may at any time hold long or short positions in such securities or other financial instruments.

On the basis of and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion as of the date hereof that the Consideration to be paid to the holders of the Company
Common Stock in the proposed Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The issuance of this opinion has been approved by a fairness opinion committee of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. This letter is provided to the Board of
Directors of the Company (in its capacity as such) in connection with and for the purposes of its evaluation of the Transaction. This opinion does not
constitute a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company as to how such stockholder should vote with respect to the Transaction or any other
matter, including, without limitation, whether any stockholder should elect to receive Stock Election Consideration, Cash Election Consideration or
Mixed Election Consideration or to make no election in the Transaction. This opinion may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or
in part) to any third party for any purpose whatsoever except with our prior written approval. This opinion may be reproduced in full in any proxy or
information statement mailed to stockholders of the Company but may not otherwise be disclosed publicly in any manner without our prior written
approval.

June 6, 2018

Board of Directors
AV Homes, Inc.
6730 N. Scottsdale Road, Suite 150
Scottsdale, AZ 85253

Ladies & Gentlemen:

You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of common stock, par value $1.00 per share
(“Company Common Stock”), of AV Homes, Inc. (the “Company”), other than the Excluded Holders (as defined below), of the Consideration (as
defined below) to be received by such holders pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the “Agreement”) to be entered into by the Company, Taylor Morrison
Homes Corporation (the “Acquiror”), Taylor Morrison Communities, Inc. (solely for purposes of Section 5.13, 7.3 and 8.14 thereof) and Thor Merger
Sub, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Acquiror (“Acquisition Sub”). As more fully described in the Agreement, Acquisition Sub will be
merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the merger (the “Transaction”) and each issued and outstanding share of Company
Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder thereof, (i) 0.9793 shares of Class A common stock, par value
$0.00001 per share (“Acquiror Common Stock”), of the Acquiror (the “Stock Election Consideration”); (ii) $21.50 in cash (the “Cash Election
Consideration”); or (iii) $12.64 in cash, and 0.4034 shares of Acquiror Common Stock (the “Mixed Election Consideration”), subject to certain
proration procedures as set forth in the Agreement (as to which we express no view or opinion). The aggregate Stock Election Consideration, Cash
Election Consideration and Mixed Election Consideration is referred to as the “Consideration”. The term “Excluded Holders” means TPG Aviator, L.P.,
which will enter into a Voting Agreement with Parent (the “Voting Agreement”), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof,
among other things, the Excluded Holders will (x) vote all Subject Shares (as defined in the Voting Agreement) held by them in favor of the Merger (the
“Voting Commitment”) and (y) make an election to receive the Stock Election Consideration in respect of the Subject Shares in accordance with the
Agreement. The Excluded Holders have been excluded from this opinion pursuant to our established policies and procedures, where we exclude
significant stockholders from our fairness opinions in certain circumstances, including where a significant stockholder enters into a voting agreement.

parties with respect to a possible acquisition of all or a portion of the Company; and (xi) conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took
into account such other information as we deemed appropriate.

In connection with our review, we have, with your consent, relied on the information supplied to, discussed with or reviewed by us for purposes of
this opinion being complete and accurate in all respects material to this opinion. We have not assumed any responsibility for independent verification of
any of such information. With your consent, we have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax,
regulatory and accounting advisors with respect to legal, tax, regulatory and accounting matters. With respect to the financial forecasts and other
information relating to the Company and the Expected Synergies referred to above we have assumed, at your direction, that they have been reasonably
prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the future performance of
the Company and the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Acquiror as to such Expected Synergies. We express no
views as to the reasonableness of any financial forecasts or the assumptions on which they are based. In addition, with your consent, we have not made
any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet, or otherwise) of the Company or the
Acquiror, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal.

Our opinion does not address the Company’s underlying business decision to effect the Transaction or the relative merits of the Transaction as
compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company and does not address any legal, regulatory, tax or
accounting matters. At your direction, we have not been asked to, nor do we, offer any opinion as to any terms of the Agreement or any aspect or
implication of the Transaction, except for the fairness of the Consideration from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock
(other than Excluded Holders). With your consent, we express no opinion as to what the value of Acquiror Common Stock actually will be when issued
pursuant to the Transaction or the prices at which Company Common Stock or Acquiror Common Stock may trade at any time. In rendering this
opinion, we have assumed, with your consent, that the final executed form of the Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft that we
have reviewed, that the Transaction will be consummated in accordance with its terms without any waiver or modification that could be material to our
analysis, and that the parties to the Agreement will comply with all the material terms of the Agreement. We have assumed, with your consent, that all
governmental, regulatory or other consents or approvals necessary for the completion of the Transaction will be obtained, except to the extent that could
not be material to our analysis.

Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as
of, the date hereof, and we assume no responsibility to update this opinion for developments after the date hereof.

We have acted as your financial advisor in connection with the Transaction and will receive a fee for our services, the principal portion of which is
contingent upon the consummation of the Transaction. We will also receive a fee upon delivery of this opinion. Our affiliates, employees, officers and
partners may at any time own securities (long or short) of the Company and the Acquiror. We have provided investment banking and other services to
the Company unrelated to the Transaction and in the future may provide such services to the Acquiror and have received and may receive compensation
for such services.

This opinion is for the use and benefit of the Board of Directors of the Company (solely in its capacity as such) in its evaluation of the
Transaction. This opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of securities should vote or act with respect to the Transaction or
any other matter, including any election by such stockholder regarding the Transaction. This opinion does not address the fairness of the Transaction or
any aspect or implication thereof to, or any other consideration of or relating to, the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of
the Company (including the Company’s convertible notes), other

than the fairness of the Consideration from a financial point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Excluded Holders). In
addition, we do not express any opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be received by any officers, directors or
employees of any parties to the Transaction, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration or otherwise. This opinion was approved by a
Moelis & Company LLC fairness opinion committee.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as the date hereof, the Consideration to be received by holders of Company
Common Stock in the Transaction is fair from a financial point of view to such holders, other than Excluded Holders.

Annex E

Section 262 of the DGCL
 
(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this

section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has
otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in
writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock
under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of
record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock” and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words
“depository receipt” mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof,
solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository.

 

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h)
of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

 

 

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the
stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either:
(i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights
shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the
vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

 

 
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of

stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§
251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

 

 a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;
 

 
b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in

respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities
exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

 

 
c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section;

or
 

 
d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts

described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.
 

 
(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is not

owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware
corporation.

 

 
(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be

available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the

procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the
word “amendment” substituted for the words “merger or consolidation,” and the word “corporation” substituted for the words “constituent
corporation” and/or “surviving or resulting corporation.”

 

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class
or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a
provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is
practicable.

 

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:
 

 

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting
of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record
date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for
which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the
shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a
nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall
deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s
shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder
intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not
constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10
days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each
constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of
the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

 

 

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation
before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each
of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger
or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation,
and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of
this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of
the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of
such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer
contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of
the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such notice did not notify
stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice
before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent
corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting
corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such
second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of

the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer
contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each
stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in accordance with this subsection.
An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such
notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the
stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10
days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the
record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be
the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

 

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied
with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by
filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the
terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has
complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the
corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of
the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such
shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder’s written request for such a statement is
received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under
subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of
shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition or
request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

 

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing
the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their
shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the
petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and
place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown
on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in
a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of
the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting
corporation.

 

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to
appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by
certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and
if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the
merger or consolidation the shares of the class

or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court
shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares
entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in
the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this
title.

 

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of
the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the
fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together
with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account
all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection,
interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5%
over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of
the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may
pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum
of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore
accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the
appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders
entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection
(f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate
fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

 

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the
case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s
decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a
corporation of this State or of any state.

 

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value
of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

 

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection
(d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except
dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation);
provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder
shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the
merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or
thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not
