The accompanying proxy statement is dated September 5, 2017 and, together with the enclosed form of proxy card, is
first being mailed on or about September 6, 2017.

 

Xcerra Corporation
825 University Avenue

Norwood, Massachusetts 02062
(781) 461-1000

September 5, 2017

To the Stockholders of Xcerra Corporation:

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) of Xcerra Corporation, a
Massachusetts corporation (“Xcerra,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), to be held on October 12, 2017, at 9:30 a.m., Eastern
time, at the headquarters of the Company at 825 University Avenue, Norwood, Massachusetts 02062.

At the Special Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it
may be amended from time to time, the “Merger Agreement”). The Merger Agreement was originally entered into by and between
Unic Capital Management Co., Ltd., a Chinese company (“Unic Capital”), China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Co.,
Ltd., a Chinese company, and the Company, as joined by Unic Acquisition Corporation, a Massachusetts corporation (“Merger Sub”)
on April 7, 2017. Upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the closing set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will,
at the closing, merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), and the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Unic
Capital.

On August 4, 2017, pursuant to that certain Assignment and Assumption Agreement, by and among Unic Capital, Hubei Xinyan
Equity Investment Partnership (Limited Partnership), a Chinese limited partnership (“Parent”) and the Company, Unic Capital
irrevocably transferred, conveyed, assigned and delivered to Parent all of Unic Capital’s right, interest, benefits, liabilities and
obligations in and under the Merger Agreement, and Parent accepted, assumed and agreed to pay, perform, fulfill and discharge all
obligations and liabilities of Unic Capital arising under or relating to the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that in the case where
Parent is unable to pay, perform, fulfill or discharge all obligations and liabilities under the Merger Agreement, Unic Capital will
remain wholly liable. Also on August 4, 2017, pursuant to that certain Amendment to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and
among Parent, Sponsor and the Company, the words “wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent” in the first paragraph of the Recitals, the
second paragraph of the Recitals, Section 2.1, Section 6.19 and Section 9.3 of the Merger Agreement were deleted in their entirety and
replaced by the words “controlled Subsidiary of Parent.” Therefore, upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the closing set
forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will, at the closing, merge with and into the Company, and the Company will become a
controlled subsidiary of Parent.

At the Special Meeting, you will also be asked to consider and vote on a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation
that will or may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

If the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $10.25 in cash, without interest, for each share of the Company’s
common stock that you own (unless you have properly exercised your appraisal rights), which represents a premium of:
(1) approximately 16% to the average closing price of the Company’s common stock

over the 30 trading day period ending on the date the Company entered into the Merger Agreement; and (2) approximately 28% to the
average closing price of the Company’s common stock over the 90 trading day period ending on the date the Company entered into the
Merger Agreement.

The Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”), after considering the factors more fully described in the enclosed
proxy statement, has unanimously (A) determined that the terms of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (B) determined that it is in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement,
(C) approved the execution and delivery by the Company of the Merger Agreement, the performance by the Company of its
covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein, and (D) resolved to
recommend that the holders of shares of the Company’s common stock adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the
Massachusetts Business Corporation Act (the “MBCA”), subject to the conditions contained therein. The Board recommends
that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time
of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become
payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

The enclosed proxy statement provides detailed information about the Special Meeting, the Merger Agreement and the Merger. A
copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement. The proxy statement also describes the actions and
determinations of the Board in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger. We encourage you to read the
proxy statement and its annexes, including the Merger Agreement, carefully and in their entirety, as they contain important
information.

Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, please sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the
enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone. If
you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy that you have previously submitted.

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in
accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your bank, broker or other
nominee cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, without your instructions.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. We cannot complete the Merger unless the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock.

exercise appraisal rights under Section 13.02 of the MBCA (clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the “Excluded Shares”)), and you will
no longer own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but you will no longer
have any rights as a stockholder (except that stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights will have the right to receive
a payment for the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to Massachusetts law, as described below under the caption
“The Merger — Appraisal Rights”).

Treatment of Restricted Stock Units

As a result of the Merger, the treatment of the Company’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the time at
which the Merger will become effective (the “Effective Time”) will be as follows:

Each Company restricted stock unit that is outstanding and either (A) vests at the Effective Time or (B) is held by a
non-employee member of the Board (each a “Vested RSU”) will be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time and the
holder thereof will receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate
number of shares of Company common stock represented by such Vested RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the
Per Share Merger Consideration (the “Restricted Stock Unit Consideration”). The Company will pay each holder of a Vested RSU
the Restricted Stock Unit Consideration on either (i) the first regulatory scheduled payroll date after the closing of the Merger or
(ii) if such payroll date is scheduled for payment prior to the fifth business day after the closing of the Merger, the second regularly
scheduled payroll date after the closing of the Merger.

Each Company restricted stock unit that is outstanding and unvested as of the Effective Time and not described in the
immediately preceding paragraph (each, an “Unvested RSU”) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company common stock
represented by such Unvested RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (the
“Unvested RSU Consideration”). The Unvested RSU Consideration will be subject to the same vesting terms and conditions
applicable to the Unvested RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the same vesting restrictions and continued
service requirements, and payment of the Unvested RSU Consideration will be made on the vesting dates applicable to the
Unvested RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, the performance-based vesting of each Company restricted stock unit that
remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a “Performance-Based RSU”) will be accelerated in full
with all performance conditions being deemed achieved at 100% and each such Performance-Based RSU will be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of
shares of Company common stock represented by such Performance-Based RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by
(y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (the “Performance-Based RSU Consideration”). The Performance-Based RSU
Consideration will be subject to the same time-based vesting terms and conditions applicable to the Performance-Based RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time and will be paid on the time-based vesting dates applicable to such Performance-Based
RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Vested RSUs, Unvested RSUs and Performance Based RSUs are sometimes
referred to herein, individually, as a “Company RSU” and, collectively, as “Company RSUs.”

Treatment of Purchase Rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan

From and after the Company’s entry into the Merger Agreement, the Company will not establish a new offering period under
the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Company ESPP”) and will take all actions
necessary so that: (i) any offering period and purchase period (or similar period during which shares may be purchased) underway
as of the date of the Merger Agreement under the Company ESPP is terminated as of no later than the last payroll date
immediately preceding the Effective Time (the actual date of such termination, the “Final Exercise Date”); (ii) any pro-rata
adjustments that may be necessary to reflect any shortened offering period or purchase period (or similar period) are made and so
that any such shortened offering period or purchase period (or similar period) is treated as a fully effective and completed offering
period or purchase period, as applicable, for all purposes under the Company ESPP; (iii) each participant’s shares purchase right
under the Company ESPP outstanding as of the Final Exercise Date are exercised as of the Final Exercise Date; (iv) no further
offering periods or purchase periods (or similar periods during which shares may be purchased) will commence under the
Company ESPP on or after the date of the Merger Agreement; (v) no participant in the Company ESPP may increase the rate of
his or her contributions to the Company ESPP on or after the date of the Merger Agreement; (vi) no individual who is not
participating in the Company ESPP as of the date of the Merger Agreement may commence participation in the Company ESPP on
or after the date of the Merger Agreement; and (vii) the Company ESPP is terminated as of the Final Exercise Date; provided,
however, that termination of the Company ESPP will be subject to the consummation of the Merger.

The Special Meeting

Date, Time and Place

A special meeting of stockholders of the Company (the “Special Meeting”) will be held on October 12, 2017, at 9:30 a.m.,
Eastern time, at the Company’s offices at 825 University Avenue, Norwood, Massachusetts 02062.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote

You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of the Company’s common stock at the close of business
on August 23, 2017 (the “Record Date”). You will have one vote at the Special Meeting for each share of the Company’s common
stock that you owned at the close of business on the Record Date.

Purpose

At the Special Meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to: (1) adopt the Merger Agreement; (2) adjourn the
Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at
the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable to
the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Required Vote

The affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock is required to
adopt the Merger Agreement. Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present,
requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of the Company’s common stock

having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.
Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable to the Company’s executive officers
in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of the Company’s common stock having
voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting entitled to vote on the subject matter.

Share Ownership of Our Directors and Executive Officers

As of August 23, 2017, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
1,426,870 shares of common stock, representing approximately 2.63% of the shares of common stock outstanding on August 23,
2017. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the
Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the non-binding,
advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in
connection with the Merger.

Voting and Proxies

Any stockholder of record entitled to vote may submit a proxy by returning a signed proxy card by mail in the accompanying
prepaid reply envelope or granting a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone, or may vote in person by appearing at
the Special Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of common stock in “street name” through a bank, broker
or other nominee, you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee of how you wish to vote your shares of common stock
using the instructions provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. Under applicable stock exchange rules, banks, brokers or
other nominees have the discretion to vote on routine matters. The proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting are
non-routine matters, and banks, brokers and other nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. Therefore,
it is important that you cast your vote or instruct your bank, broker or nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.

If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the
Special Meeting by: (1) signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it prior to the Special Meeting; (2) submitting a
new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy; (3) delivering a written
notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or (4) attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for
instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy”
from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,
you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in
addition to, your interests as a stockholder. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii) approving the Merger
Agreement and the Merger; and (iii) recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by stockholders, the Board was aware
of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. These interests include the
following:
 

 
•  termination of vested restricted stock units and, in the case of non-employee directors, unvested restricted stock units at

the Effective Time in exchange for a cash payment to be made shortly after the Effective Time;

thereto, held by executive officers into rights to receive cash payments in accordance with the vesting schedule of the
restricted stock units;

Agreements and executive employment agreements in connection with certain terminations of employment, as described

Termination or Change-in-Control”; and

 

 •  continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be provided by the Surviving Corporation.

If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved, the shares of our common stock held by our directors and
executive officers will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of our common stock held by all other stockholders.

Non-Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals; Change in Recommendation

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on May 12, 2017, the Company and
its subsidiaries and their respective representatives are permitted to:
 

 
•  take any action to initiate, solicit, induce and encourage, facilitate and assist with acquisition proposals (or any inquiries

or the making of any proposals, expressions of interest or other offers or attempts that could reasonably be expected to
lead to any acquisition proposal); and

 

 
•  enter into, participate or engage in, and maintain discussions, communications or negotiations with respect to any

acquisition proposal (or any inquiries or the making of any proposals, expressions of interest or other offers or attempts
that could reasonably be expected to lead to any acquisition proposal).

Thereafter, except as expressly permitted in the Merger Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries may not and may not
authorize its respective representatives to:
 

 
•  solicit, initiate or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist with

respect to the preparation, submission or announcement of, an acquisition proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
would reasonably be expected to lead to any acquisition proposal;

 

 

•  furnish to any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees or representatives of Parent or Merger Sub) any

Sub) with respect to, or with the intent to induce, encourage, facilitate or assist in the making, submission or
announcement of, an acquisition proposal or any inquiries, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead
to any acquisition proposal;

 

 

•  agree to, approve, endorse, recommend or consummate any acquisition proposal or enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or similar document, or any contract (other than an acceptable
confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with the Merger Agreement) contemplating or otherwise relating to
an acquisition proposal or acquisition transaction; or

 

 
•  grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any equity securities of the

Company or any of its subsidiaries or their respective assets or properties;

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the stockholder vote on the Merger, the solicitation restrictions are
subject to a customary “fiduciary-out” provision that allows the Board, under certain circumstances, to provide information to and
participate in negotiations or discussions with third parties with respect to an acquisition proposal received from any person that
did not arise out of a breach of the solicitation restrictions set forth in the Merger Agreement which constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead a superior proposal if the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties
under applicable law.

In addition, if prior to the approval of the Merger by the Company’s stockholders the Company receives an acquisition
proposal that constitutes a superior proposal, the Board may (i) change its recommendation with respect to the adoption of the
Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders or (ii) authorize the Company to terminate the Merger Agreement to
concurrently enter into a definitive agreement in response to the superior proposal. In addition, the Board may change its
recommendation with respect to the Merger for a reason unrelated to an acquisition proposal in connection with the occurrence of
certain intervening events. Prior to taking these actions, however, the Board must have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties under
applicable law and the Company must have provided Parent with a five business day period (and a subsequent three business day
match period) in which to negotiate with the Company, and is obligated to negotiate with Parent in good faith, in order to amend
the terms of the proposed transaction so as to avoid such recommendation change.

Financing of the Merger

We anticipate that the total amount of funds necessary to complete the Merger and the related transactions will be
approximately $580 million, which will be funded via the equity and debt financing described below. This amount includes funds
needed to (i) pay the Company’s stockholders the amounts due under the Merger Agreement and (ii) make payments in respect of
certain of the Company’s outstanding equity-based awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

In connection with the Merger, (A) Sponsor has committed to subscribe for equity securities of Parent with an aggregate
purchase price of RMB 1.5 billion (equivalent to approximately $227.4 million based on the prevailing exchange rate as of August
30, 2017) and (B) Lender has committed to loan to Parent the lesser of (1) RMB2.76 billion (equivalent to approximately
$418.5 million based on the prevailing exchange rate as of August 30, 2017) and (2) the difference of (x) the RMB equivalent of
the aggregate payment obligations of Parent under the Merger Agreement less (y) RMB1.5 billion. For more information, see the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger — Financing of the Merger.”

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The
Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s shares of common
stock in the Merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the difference, if any, between
the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of
common stock surrendered in the Merger.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in the
Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the
Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under other federal tax laws or the laws of any state,
local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

Under the Merger Agreement, the Merger cannot be completed until: (i) the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act; (ii) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period or approval by the relevant
governmental authorities with respect to the Foreign Antitrust Jurisdictions; (iii) the approval or clearance of the Merger by CFIUS
(or non-action, or an announcement of non-action, by the President of the United States within the period during which the
President may announce his decision after receipt by the President of a CFIUS report requesting the President’s decision with
respect to the Merger); (iv) the approval by the relevant governmental authorities in the PRC has been obtained; and (v) the
approval by the relevant governmental authorities in Taiwan has been obtained.

In the PRC, these approvals include (A) the receipt of a Filing Notice (or any equivalent document as amended/renamed)
issued by the National Development and Reform Commission of the PRC or its competent local counterparts (“NDRC”) with
respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (B) receipt of an Enterprise Overseas
Direct Investment Certificate (or any equivalent document as amended/renamed) issued by the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC
or its competent local counterparts (“MOFCOM”) with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement; (C) completion of an overseas direct investment registration with the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange of the PRC or its competent local counterparts (“SAFE”) or an authorized PRC bank under SAFE’s supervision (as
applicable), and the receipt of a Business Registration Certificate with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and other
registration, filing or approval required by PRC law.

In Taiwan, these approvals include filings, approvals or clearances for foreign/PRC investments under the Taiwan Act
Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area and the Measures Governing Investment
Permitted to the People of Mainland Area.

Appraisal Rights

Under the MBCA, the Company is required to state whether it has concluded that Company stockholders are, are not or may
be entitled to assert appraisal rights, which are generally available to stockholders of a merging Massachusetts corporation under
Section 13.02(a)(1) of the MBCA, subject to certain exceptions. For the reasons described under the caption “The

Table of Contents

Company stockholders may be entitled to appraisal rights. The relevant provisions of the MBCA have not been the subject of
judicial interpretation and the Company and Parent reserve the right to contest the validity and availability of any purported
demand for appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.

Under Part 13 of the MBCA, Company stockholders who believe they are or may be entitled to appraisal rights in connection
with the Merger must, in order to exercise those rights:
 

 
•  prior to the Special Meeting, deliver to the Company a written notice of intent to demand payment for such

stockholders’ shares of Company common stock if the Merger is effectuated;
 

 •  NOT vote for the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; and
 

 •  Comply with the other procedures under Part 13 of the MBCA.

Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the MBCA may result in the loss of any appraisal rights. If you
hold your shares of Company common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal
rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the
making of a demand for appraisal by your bank, brokerage firm or nominee. See the section captioned “The Merger — Appraisal
Rights” and the text of Part 13 of the MBCA reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement.

A: The Special Meeting will take place on October 12, 2017, at 9:30 a.m., Eastern time, at the offices of the Company at 825
University Avenue, Norwood, Massachusetts 02062.

 
Q: Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
 

A: Stockholders as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting. Each holder of
shares of the Company’s common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting
for each share of common stock owned as of the Record Date.

 
Q: May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
 

A: Yes. All stockholders as of the Record Date may attend the Special Meeting and vote in person. Seating will be limited.
Stockholders will need to present proof of ownership of shares of the Company’s common stock, such as a bank or brokerage
account statement, and a form of personal identification to be admitted to the Special Meeting. No cameras, recording equipment,
electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in the Special Meeting.

Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the Special Meeting, we
encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy
electronically over the Internet or by telephone. If you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will
revoke any proxy previously submitted.

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in
accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker

or other nominee. Your broker or other agent cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, without your instructions. If you hold your shares in “street name,” you may not vote your shares in person at the
Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

 
Q: What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on the Company?
 

A: The proposed Merger is the acquisition of the Company by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by
stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub will merge
with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, the Company
will become a controlled subsidiary of Parent, and the Company’s common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be
delisted from NASDAQ. In addition, the Company’s common stock will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and the Company will no longer file periodic reports with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

 
Q: What will I receive if the Merger is completed?
 

A: Upon completion of the Merger, you will be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each share of common
stock that you own, unless you have properly exercised and not withdrawn your appraisal rights under the MBCA. For example, if
you own 10 shares of common stock, you will receive $102.50 in cash in exchange for your shares of common stock, without
interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

 
Q: How does the Per Share Merger Consideration compare to the unaffected market price of the common stock?
 

A: The $10.25 Per Share Merger Consideration constitutes a premium of (1) approximately 13.8% to the closing price of the
Company’s common stock on April 7, 2017, the last trading day prior to the date on which the Company entered in the Merger
Agreement and (2) approximately 16% to the average closing price of the Company’s common stock in the 30 trading day period
ending on the date on which the Company entered into the Merger Agreement.

 
Q: What do I need to do now?
 

A: We encourage you to read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we refer to in this
proxy statement carefully and consider how the Merger affects you. Then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the
enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone, so
that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting, unless you wish to seek appraisal. If you hold your shares in “street name,”
please refer to the voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Please do not
send your stock certificates with your proxy card.

 
Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now?
 

A: No. After the Merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to send your stock
certificates to the payment agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of common stock represented by
your stock certificates. You should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the cash payment to which
you are entitled. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.

Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the Special
Meeting?

 

A: The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to be
completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of the Company’s common stock after the Record Date but before the Special
Meeting, unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or
otherwise transfer your shares and each of you notifies the Company in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your
shares, but you will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your
shares of the Company’s common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed
proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone.

 
Q: How does the Board recommend that I vote?
 

A: The Board, after considering the various factors described under the caption “The Merger — Reasons for the Merger and
Recommendation of the Board,” has unanimously (1) determined that the terms of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (2) determined
that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement,
(3) approved the execution and delivery by the Company of the Merger Agreement, the performance by the Company of its
covenants and agreements contained therein and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein and (4) resolved to recommend that the holders
of shares of the Company’s common stock adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the MBCA, subject to the conditions
contained therein. The Board recommends that you vote: (A) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (B) “FOR” the
adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt
the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (C) “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve
compensation that will or may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 
Q: What happens if the Merger is not completed?
 

A: If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will
not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public company, the
Company’s common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act, and the
Company will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC.

Under specified circumstances, the Company will be required to pay Parent a termination fee upon the termination of the Merger
Agreement; and under different specified circumstances, Parent will be required to pay the Company a termination fee upon the
termination of the Merger Agreement. For more details see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
Agreement — Termination Fees.”

 
Q: What vote is required to adopt the Merger Agreement?
 

A: The affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock is required to adopt
the Merger Agreement.

If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card, (2) grant
a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone or (3) vote in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger

Agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your
bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

 
Q: What vote is required to approve any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit

additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting and to
approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable to the Company’s named
executive officers in connection with the Merger?

 

A: Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of the Company’s common stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the
Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or
may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of the Company’s common stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the
Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.

The failure of any stockholder of record to (1) submit a signed proxy card, (2) grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone or (3) vote in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal or the
compensation proposal. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to
vote your shares will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal and the compensation proposal. Abstentions will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the adjournment proposal and the compensation proposal.

 
Q: Why am I being asked to cast a non-binding, advisory vote regarding compensation that will or may become payable to

the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
 

A: SEC rules require the Company to seek a non-binding, advisory vote regarding compensation that will or may become payable by
the Company to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 
Q: What is the compensation that will or may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with

the Merger for purposes of this advisory vote?
 

A: The compensation that will or may become payable by the Company to its named executive officers in connection with the
Merger is certain compensation that is tied to or based on the Merger and payable to certain of the Company’s named executive
officers. For further detail, see the section captioned “Proposal 3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote on Merger-Related Executive
Compensation Arrangements.”

 
Q: What will happen if stockholders do not approve the compensation that will or may become payable by the Company to

its named executive officers in connection with the Merger at the Special Meeting?
 

A: Approval of Proposal 3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote on Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements is not a
condition to completion of the Merger. The vote with respect to such proposal is an advisory vote and will not be binding on the
Company or Parent. If the Merger Agreement is adopted by the stockholders and the Merger is completed, the compensation that
will or may become payable by the Company to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger may be paid to the
Company’s named executive officers even if stockholders fail to approve Proposal 3: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote on Merger-
Related Executive Compensation Arrangements.

Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
 

A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, you are considered,
with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have been
sent directly to you by the Company.

If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of common
stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other nominee
who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to
direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are also invited
to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at
the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

 
Q: How may I vote?
 

A: If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of common stock are registered in your name with Computershare
Investor Services, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:

 

 •  by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;
 

 •  by visiting the Internet address on your proxy card;
 

 •  by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card; or
 

 •  by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot;

A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of common
stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by
telephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the Internet or
by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.

Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of common stock by
proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your
shares of common stock in person by ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present
at the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or
other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a service
is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone. To vote over the Internet or
by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your
bank, broker or nominee.

 
Q: If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
 

A: No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at
the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures
provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such
proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted against adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on
the adjournment proposal or the compensation proposal.

Table of Contents

Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?
 

A: Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the
Special Meeting by:

 

 •  signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
 

 •  submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 

 •  delivering a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary; or
 

 •  attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions
regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your
bank, broker or other nominee.

 
Q: What is a proxy?
 

A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of common stock. The written
document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The
document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of common stock is called a “proxy card.” David G. Tacelli, our President
and Chief Executive Officer, Mark J. Gallenberger, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and Colin Savoy, our
Chief Legal Counsel and Corporate Secretary, with full power of substitution, are the proxy holders for the Special Meeting.

 
Q: If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
 

A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When
completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or
against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.

If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares
represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the
adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding,
advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the
Merger.

 
Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 

A: Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone) each proxy card and voting
instruction card that you receive.

You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy
cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a
separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a stockholder of record and your
shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.

 
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
 

A: If available, the Company may announce preliminary voting results at the conclusion of the Special Meeting. The Company
intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed

with the SEC following the Special Meeting. All reports that the Company files with the SEC are publicly available when filed.
See the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”

 
Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?
 

A: For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger — Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s shares of common stock in the
Merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the difference, if any, between the
amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of common
stock surrendered in the Merger.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the caption “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of common stock for cash in the
Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

You should consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the Merger in light of
your particular circumstances and any consequences arising under other federal tax laws or the laws of any state, local or
non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger — Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

 
Q: What will the holders of Company RSUs receive in the Merger?
 

A:         (i) Each Vested RSU will be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time and the holder thereof will receive an amount
in cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company common
stock represented by such Vested RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, which
amount will be paid to the holder of such Vested RSU on either (i) the first regulatory scheduled payroll date after the closing of
the Merger or (ii) if such payroll date is scheduled for payment prior to the fifth business day after the closing of the Merger, the
second regularly scheduled payroll date after the closing of the Merger;

(ii) each Unvested RSU will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company common stock represented by such Unvested RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, the payment of which will remain subject to
the same vesting terms and conditions applicable to the Unvested RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the
same vesting restrictions and continued service requirements, and will be made on the vesting dates applicable to such Unvested
RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

(iii) effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, the performance-based vesting of each Performance-Based RSU will
be accelerated in full with all performance conditions being deemed achieved at 100% and each such Performance-Based RSU
will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(x) the aggregate number of shares of Company common stock represented by such Performance-Based RSU immediately prior
to the Effective Time by (y) the Merger Consideration, the payment of which will remain subject to the same time-based vesting
terms and conditions applicable to the Performance-Based RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and will be made on the
time-based vesting dates applicable to such Performance-Based RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 
Q: What will happen to the ESPP?
 

A: The Company will not establish a new offering period under the Company ESPP and will take all actions necessary so that:
(i) any offering period and purchase period (or similar period during which shares may be

purchased) underway as of the date of the Merger Agreement under the Company ESPP is terminated as of the Final Exercise
Date; (ii) any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect any shortened offering period or purchase period (or similar
period) are made and so that any such shortened offering period or purchase period (or similar period) is treated as a fully
effective and completed offering period or purchase period, as applicable, for all purposes under the Company ESPP; (iii) each
participant’s shares purchase right under the Company ESPP outstanding as of the Final Exercise Date are exercised as of the
Final Exercise Date; (iv) no further offering periods or purchase periods (or similar periods during which shares may be
purchased) will commence under the Company ESPP on or after the date of the Merger Agreement; (v) no participant in the
Company ESPP may increase the rate of his or her contributions to the Company ESPP on or after the date of the Merger
Agreement; (vi) no individual who is not participating in the Company ESPP as of the date of the Merger Agreement may
commence participation in the Company ESPP on or after the date of the Merger Agreement; and (vii) the Company ESPP is
terminated as of the Final Exercise Date, provided, however, that termination of the Company ESPP will be subject to the
consummation of the Merger.

 
Q: When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
 

A: We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to complete the Merger by the end of
the calendar year. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to the
closing conditions specified in the Merger Agreement, many of which are outside of our control.

 
Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights under the MBCA?
 

A: Under the MBCA, the Company is required to state whether it has concluded that Company stockholders are, are not or may be
entitled to assert appraisal rights, which are generally available to stockholders of a merging Massachusetts corporation under
Section 13.02(a)(1) of the MBCA, subject to certain exceptions. For the reasons described under the caption “The Merger —
Appraisal Rights,” the Company has concluded that Company stockholders may be entitled to appraisal rights. The relevant
provisions of the MBCA have not been the subject of judicial interpretation and the Company and Parent reserve the right to
contest the validity and availability of any purported demand for appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.

Under Part 13 of the MBCA, Company stockholders who believe they are or may be entitled to appraisal rights in connection
with the Merger must, in order to exercise those rights:

 

 
•  prior to the Special Meeting, deliver to the Company a written notice of intent to demand payment for such stockholders’

shares of Company common stock if the Merger is effectuated;
 

 •  NOT vote for the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; and
 

 •  Comply with the other procedures under Part 13 of the MBCA.

Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the MBCA may result in the loss of any appraisal rights. If you hold
your shares of Company common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal
rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the
making of a demand for appraisal by your bank, brokerage firm or nominee. See the section captioned “The Merger — Appraisal
Rights” and the text of Part 13 of the MBCA reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement.

 
Q: Do any of the Company’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of the Company’s

stockholders generally?
 

A: Yes. In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should be
aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger

that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger
Agreement; (ii) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii) recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted
by stockholders, the Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other
matters. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger — Interests of the Company’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger
Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there
are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the non-binding,
advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in
connection with the Merger.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Certain statements contained in this filing may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding the proposed transaction involving Xcerra and Parent and the
ability to consummate the transaction. Forward-looking statements generally include statements that are predictive in nature and
depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, and include words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” “expect,”
“anticipate,” “plan,” “likely,” “believe,” “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” and other similar expressions among others. Statements that
are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and assumptions that
are subject to risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those
contained in any forward-looking statement as a result of various factors, including, without limitation: the risk that the conditions to
the closing of the transaction are not satisfied, including the failure to timely or at all obtain stockholder approval for the transaction or
the failure to timely or at all obtain any required regulatory clearances, including under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements
Act of 1976 (HSR), from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and certain overseas investment
approvals in the People’s Republic of China (PRC); uncertainties as to the timing of the consummation of the transaction and the
ability of each of Xcerra and Parent to consummate the transaction, including as a result of the failure of Parent to obtain or provide on
a timely basis or at all the necessary financing; risks that the transaction disrupts the current plans and operations of Xcerra; the ability
of Xcerra to retain and hire key personnel; competitive responses to the transaction; unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting
from the transaction; potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of
the transaction; and legislative, regulatory, political and economic developments. The foregoing review of important factors that could

THE SPECIAL MEETING

The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board for use at the Special Meeting.

Date, Time and Place

We will hold the Special Meeting on October 12, 2017, at 9:30 a.m., Eastern time, at the offices of the Company at 825 University
Avenue, Norwood, Massachusetts 02062.

Purpose of the Special Meeting

At the Special Meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to (i) adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) adjourn the Special
Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the
time of the Special Meeting and (iii) approve, by a non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable to the
Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Board Recommendation

The Board, after considering various factors described under the caption “The Merger — Reasons for the Merger and
Recommendation of the Board,” has unanimously (i) determined that the terms of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement are fair to, and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, (ii) determined that it is in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the Merger Agreement, (iii) approved the
execution and delivery by the Company of the Merger Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants and agreements
contained therein and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement upon the
terms and subject to the conditions contained therein and (iv) resolved to recommend that the holders of shares of the Company’s
common stock adopt the Merger Agreement in accordance with the MBCA, subject to the conditions contained therein. The Board
recommends that you vote: (A) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (B) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the
Special Meeting; and (C) “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to the
Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum

Only stockholders of record as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting.
A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available at our principal executive offices, located at 825
University Avenue, Norwood, Massachusetts 02062, during regular business hours for a period of no less than ten days before the
Special Meeting and at the place of the Special Meeting during the meeting.

As of August 23, 2017, there were 54,356,609 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special
Meeting.

The holders of a majority in voting power of the common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in
person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Special
Meeting, it is expected that the meeting will be adjourned to solicit additional proxies.

Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

The affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares of common stock on the Record Date is required to
adopt the Merger Agreement. Adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders is a condition to the closing of the
Merger.

Table of Contents

Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares of stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to
vote on the subject matter. Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of compensation that will or may become payable to the
Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of stock
having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.

If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. For stockholders who abstain from voting, the abstention will have the same effect as if the
stockholder voted “AGAINST” any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting and “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, by
non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or by proxy, but abstains from voting.

Each “broker non-vote” will also count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, but will have no
effect on (i) the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting or (ii) the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote,
compensation that will or may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger. A “broker
non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because
the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote the shares. “Broker
non-votes,” if any, will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.

Shares Held by the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers

As of August 23, 2017, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
1,426,870 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 2.63% of the shares of our common stock outstanding on
August 23, 2017. Our directors and executive officers have informed us that they currently intend to vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption of
the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the non-binding,
advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection
with the Merger.

Voting of Proxies

If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, you may cause your shares to
be voted by returning a signed and dated proxy card in the accompanying prepaid envelope, or you may vote in person at the Special
Meeting. Additionally, you may grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions on your
proxy card. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the instructions on the proxy card, in order to grant a proxy
electronically over the Internet or by telephone. Based on your proxy cards or Internet and telephone proxies, the proxy holders will
vote your shares according to your directions.

If you plan to attend the Special Meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the Special Meeting. If your
shares are registered in your name, you are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person. If
you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.

Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received in time
for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the

instructions of the stockholder. Properly signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted: (1) “FOR”
adoption of the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the
proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable to the Company’s named executive
officers in connection with the Merger.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or
other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or attending the Special
Meeting and voting in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee. If such a service is provided, you may
vote over the Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by following the instructions on the voting form
provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not return your bank’s, broker’s or other nominee’s voting form, do not vote
via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if possible, or do not attend the Special Meeting and vote in
person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee, it will have the same effect as if you voted “AGAINST” the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but will not have any effect on the adjournment proposal or the compensation proposal.

Revocability of Proxies

If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the Special
Meeting by:
 

 •  signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;
 

 •  submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;
 

 •  delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or
 

 •  attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you have submitted a proxy, your appearance at the Special Meeting, in the absence of voting in person or submitting an
additional proxy or revocation, will not have the effect of revoking your prior proxy.

If you hold your shares of common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for instructions
regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank,
broker or other nominee.

Any adjournment, postponement or other delay of the Special Meeting, including for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies,
will allow stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the Special Meeting as
adjourned, postponed or delayed.

Solicitation of Proxies

The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. The Company has engaged The Proxy Advisory Group, LLC, a
proxy solicitation firm (the “Proxy Solicitor”), to assist in the solicitation of proxies and provide related advice and informational
support, for a services fee, plus customary disbursements, which are not expected to exceed $20,000 in total. We will also indemnify
the Proxy Solicitor against losses arising out of its provisions of these services on our behalf. In addition, we may reimburse banks,
brokers and other nominees representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to such
beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by our directors, officers and employees, personally or by telephone, email, fax, over
the Internet or other means of communication. No additional compensation will be paid for such services.

Table of Contents

Adjournments or Postponements

Although it is not currently expected, the Special Meeting may be adjourned for the purpose of, among other things, soliciting
additional proxies, by the vote of a majority of the shares of the Company’s common stock represented at the Special Meeting, whether
or not a quorum is present. Any signed proxies received by us for which no voting instructions are provided on such matter will be
voted “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting.

Appraisal Rights

Under the MBCA, the Company is required to state whether it has concluded that Company stockholders are, are not or may be
entitled to assert appraisal rights, which are generally available to stockholders of a merging Massachusetts corporation under
Section 13.02(a)(1) of the MBCA, subject to certain exceptions. For the reasons described under the caption “The Merger — Appraisal
Rights,” the Company has concluded that Company stockholders may be entitled to appraisal rights. The relevant provisions of the
MBCA have not been the subject of judicial interpretation and the Company and Parent reserve the right to contest the validity and
availability of any purported demand for appraisal rights in connection with the Merger.

Under Part 13 of the MBCA, Company stockholders who believe they are or may be entitled to appraisal rights in connection
with the Merger must, in order to exercise those rights:
 

•  prior to the Special Meeting, deliver to the Company a written notice of intent to demand payment for such stockholders’ shares
of Company common stock if the Merger is effectuated;

 

•  NOT vote for the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; and
 

•  Comply with the other procedures under Part 13 of the MBCA.

Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the MBCA may result in the loss of any appraisal rights. If you hold your
shares of Company common stock through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you
should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand
for appraisal by your bank, brokerage firm or nominee. See the section captioned “The Merger — Appraisal Rights” and the text of
Part 13 of the MBCA reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement.

Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Stockholder Meeting to be Held on October 12, 2017

The proxy statement is available at http://www.xcerra.com/investors/download-library under “Investors  — Download Library.”

Householding of Special Meeting Materials

Unless we have received contrary instructions, we may send a single copy of this proxy statement to any household at which two
or more stockholders reside if we believe the stockholders are members of the same family. Each stockholder in the household will
continue to receive a separate proxy card. This process, known as “householding,” reduces the volume of duplicate information
received at your household and helps to reduce our expenses.

If you would like to receive your own set of our disclosure documents in connection with the Special Meeting or this year’s or
any future year’s annual meeting (if any), follow the instructions described below. Similarly, if you share an address with another
stockholder and together both of you would like to receive only a single set of our disclosure documents, follow these instructions.

PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

We are asking you to approve and adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

For a summary of and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the Merger Agreement and the
Merger throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth in the sections captioned “The Merger” beginning on page
30 of this proxy statement and “The Merger Agreement” beginning on page 85 of this proxy statement. A copy of the Merger
Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. You are urged to read the Merger Agreement carefully in its entirety.

Under applicable law and the terms of our articles of organization, we cannot complete the Merger without the affirmative vote of
two-thirds of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock voting in favor of the proposal to approve and adopt the Merger
Agreement and the Merger. If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote, in person or by proxy, or fail to give voting instructions to
your brokerage firm, bank, trust or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 2: ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. If
stockholders approve the adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special
Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including proxies from stockholders that have previously returned
properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement. Among other things, approval of the adjournment
proposal could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the Merger
Agreement such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting without a
vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor
of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or
otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY, NON-BINDING VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
ARRANGEMENTS

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act of 2010, requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the
payment of certain compensation that will or may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the
Merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute Compensation.”

We are asking stockholders to indicate their approval of the various compensation that will or may become payable to the
Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the section captioned “The
Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute Compensation” and the
accompanying footnotes.

In general, the various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made have previously
formed part of the Company’s overall compensation program for our named executive officers and previously have been disclosed to
stockholders as part of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related sections of our annual proxy statements. These historical
arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board, which is composed solely of
non-management directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.

As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Xcerra is asking its stockholders to vote on the adoption of the following
resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Xcerra’s named executive officers in connection
with the Merger, as disclosed in the above table entitled ‘Golden Parachute Compensation,’ including the associated narrative
discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”

The vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the Merger is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the
Merger Agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the executive compensation and vote against adoption of the Merger
Agreement, or vice versa. Because the vote is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either Xcerra. Accordingly, because
Xcerra is contractually obligated to pay the compensation, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable
thereto, if the Merger is approved and consummated and regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.

Approval of the advisory resolution on executive compensation payable to Xcerra’s named executive officers in connection with
the Merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote on the subject matter. Proxies received but marked as abstentions will be considered a vote “AGAINST” this proposal.
The Board recommends a vote “FOR” this proposal.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

Effect of the Merger

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Merger Sub will merge with

result of the Merger, the Company’s common stock will no longer be

publicly traded and will be delisted from NASDAQ. In addition, the Company’s common stock will be deregistered under the
Exchange Act, and the Company will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. If the Merger is completed, you will not own any
shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

The Effective Time will occur upon the filing of the articles of merger with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts (or at such later time as we, Parent and Merger Sub may agree and specify in the articles of merger).

Effect on the Company if the Merger is Not Completed

If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, stockholders will
not receive any payment for their shares of common stock. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public company, the
Company’s common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act and the Company
will continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, we expect that management will operate
the business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today and that stockholders will continue to be subject to the same
risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including risks related to the highly competitive industry in which the
Company operates and risks related to adverse economic or industry conditions.

Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, the
price of the Company’s common stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of the
Company’s common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

Accordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities or the
future value of your shares of common stock. If the Merger is not completed, the Board will continue to evaluate and review the
Company’s business operations, strategic direction and capitalization, among other things, and will make such changes as are deemed
appropriate. If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can
be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Board will be offered or that the Company’s business, prospects or results
of operation will not be adversely impacted.

In addition, the Company will be required to pay to Parent a termination fee of $14,250,000 or $22,800,000 if the Merger
Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances. For more information please see the section captioned “The Merger
Agreement — Termination Fees.”

Merger Consideration

In the Merger, each outstanding share of common stock (other than Excluded Shares) will be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration.

After the Merger is completed, you will have the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have
any rights as a stockholder (except that stockholders who properly exercise their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a
payment for the “fair value” of their shares as determined pursuant to Massachusetts law, as described below under the caption “The
Merger — Appraisal Rights”).

Background of the Merger

The Company’s business is the production and sale of test and handling capital equipment, interface products, test fixtures and
related services to the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industries. The semiconductor and electronics manufacturing
industries are highly concentrated and have experienced significant merger and acquisition activity in recent years which has resulted
in industry consolidation of existing or

potential customers and intense competition among providers of products and services like those produced and provided by the
Company. As a result of such consolidation, a small number of semiconductor device manufacturers, contract assemblers and
electronics manufacturers account for a substantial portion of the purchases of semiconductor equipment, manufacturing products and
services generally.

In light of such consolidation and competition, the Company has become dependent on a small number of customers for the
majority of its revenue. In the Company’s 2016 fiscal year, 40% of the Company’s revenue was derived from the Company’s five
largest customers and 17% of the Company’s revenue was derived from products and services shipped into Hong Kong/China. As a
result of this concentration, the Company has become particularly sensitive to changes in demand from any of its largest customers and
when changes in the market cause its largest customers to delay, reduce or terminate their orders, the Company’s business is
significantly adversely affected.

The Board, together with management of the Company, regularly reviews and assesses the Company’s performance, future
growth prospects, business plan and overall strategic direction and considers a variety of strategic alternatives that may be available to
the Company, including continuing to pursue the Company’s strategy as a stand-alone company or pursuing potential strategic or
financing transactions with third parties, in each case with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. In light of the significant
concentration of a small number of semiconductor test and handling producers in the United States and internationally, opportunities
for strategic acquisitions or other transactions with competitors are limited.

On May 27, 2015, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, a portion of which was also attended by members of the
Company’s management. Among the matters discussed at the meeting, the Board discussed the potential divestiture of the Company’s
board fabrication business (the “Hong Kong Divestiture”) to a subsidiary of a Chinese company publicly traded on the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange (such subsidiary, “Party A”). At such meeting, following a review and discussion of the terms of the Hong Kong Divestiture,
the financial performance of the board fabrication business, and other matters relating to the Hong Kong Divestiture, including the
semiconductor test market generally and the state of the semiconductor industry in China, the Board unanimously approved
management’s pursuit of the Hong Kong Divestiture and directed members of management to negotiate the terms of the Hong Kong
Divestiture.

Between May 27, 2015 and August 27, 2015, the Company pursued the consummation of the Hong Kong Divestiture with Party
A, including by negotiating the terms of an asset purchase agreement and engaging in several discussions and meetings with
representatives of Party A to discuss and pursue the Hong Kong Divestiture.

On June 29, 2015, Mr. Gallenberger and representatives of Party A participated in a meeting to discuss the Hong Kong
Divestiture. During the meeting, representatives of Party A discussed ways in which Party A might be able to assist the Company in its
efforts to grow the Company’s business in the Chinese market, including through a joint venture involving Party A and the Company
(the “Hong Kong Joint Venture”).

On August 27, 2015, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, a portion of which was also attended by members of the
Company’s management. Among other matters discussed at the meeting, the Board discussed progress made with respect to the Hong
Kong Divestiture. Following discussion and review of the definitive asset purchase agreement for the Hong Kong Divestiture, the
Board unanimously approved the Company’s entry into a definitive asset purchase agreement for the sale of the Company’s board
fabrication business and directed management to pursue the closing of the Hong Kong Divestiture.

On October 21, 2015, Mr. Tacelli, and Mr. Gallenberger met with representatives of Party A in China to discuss the closing of the
Hong Kong Divestiture, the state of the semiconductor market generally, and the state of the semiconductor market in China
specifically. Both parties continued discussions regarding the joint venture discussion previously held on June 29, 2015, in which the
representatives of Party A discussed ways in which

Party A might be able to assist the Company in its efforts to grow the Company’s business in the Chinese market, including through the
Hong Kong Joint Venture. Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger discussed the Company’s current business in China, the Company’s
strategies for growth in China, and ways in which the Company may benefit from a strategic partnership with Party A. Following
discussion, the parties determined to first pursue the closing of the Hong Kong Divestiture and, after the closing of such transaction, to
then discuss potential opportunities for partnership in the Chinese market.

On November 19, 2015, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, a portion of which was attended by members of the
Company’s management. At the meeting, the Board discussed, among other matters, the Company’s business opportunities, the
semiconductor test market generally, customer consolidations, and specific sales efforts, including the Company’s strategies for growth
in the Chinese market. Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger also provided the Board an update with respect to the Hong Kong Divestiture
and discussed the conversation Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger had with Party A in October with respect to a potential partnership or
joint venture between Party A and the Company’s test group to expand the Company’s business in China. The Board then discussed the
Company’s position and opportunities in the domestic and international markets, including the state of the semiconductor and
electronics manufacturing industries in China, the importance of the Chinese market to the Company and strategies for improving the
Company’s presence in China. Following such discussion, the Board directed management to pursue further discussions with respect to
the Hong Kong Joint Venture.

On December 1, 2015, the Company completed the Hong Kong Divestiture.

On December 10, 2015, Mr. Tacelli and Rich Yerganian, the Company’s vice president of investor relations, participated in an
introductory meeting with representatives of Cowen in New York, New York. During the meeting, Messrs. Tacelli and Yerganian
discussed the importance of the Chinese market to the Company’s business, the rapid growth of the Company’s business in China, and
strategies to continue to grow the Company’s presence in China. The representatives of Cowen discussed with Messrs. Tacelli and
Yerganian trends in the semiconductor market generally and with respect to China specifically and potential opportunities to grow the
Company’s business in China.

On January 20, 2016, Mr. Gallenberger and Steve Wigley, the Company’s vice president of the Company’s semiconductor ATE
group, met with representatives of Party A in Beijing, China to further discuss the Hong Kong Joint Venture. At the meeting the parties
discussed the importance of the Chinese market to the Company, business opportunities in the Chinese market, and the value each party
could potentially bring to the Hong Kong Joint Venture.

In January and February of 2016, members of the Company’s management participated in further discussions with Party A
regarding the Hong Kong Joint Venture. The discussions did not result in consummation of the Hong Kong Joint Venture and
discussions between Party A and members of the Company’s management ended.

On February 23, 2016, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, a portion of which was attended by members of the
Company’s management. At the meeting, the Board discussed, among other matters, the Company’s business opportunities and
strategy for growth, including with respect to the importance of the Chinese market to the Company’s growth and efforts to grow the
Company’s presence in China. Mr. Gallenberger then discussed with the Board the closing of the Hong Kong Divestiture and
subsequent discussions related to the Hong Kong Joint Venture. Mr. Gallenberger noted the discussions regarding the Hong Kong Joint
Venture had not resulted in an agreement to pursue a strategic partnership with Party A, but that the Company’s management continued
to believe it was important to explore strategies to grow the Company’s business in the Chinese market. Mr. Tacelli then led the Board
in a discussion of various strategies to grow the Company’s business, both generally and in China specifically.

On February 25, 2016, the Company publicly announced its second quarter results for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2016,
which indicated a 8% decrease in net sales to $72.3 million for the second quarter of the Company’s 2016 fiscal year as compared to
$78.4 million of net sales in the first quarter of the Company’s 2016 fiscal year, GAAP net income of $0.08 per diluted share and
non-GAAP net loss of $0.06 per diluted share. On the same date, members of the Company’s management participated in an investor
conference call during which the Company’s guidance for the third quarter of its fiscal year was discussed, which included net sales in
the range of $80 million to $83 million and non-GAAP net loss or income in the range of -$0.02 to $0.01, respectively, per diluted
share. The closing price of the Company’s common stock on the first full day of trading following announcement of the second
quarter’s results was $5.80 per share, down approximately 2% from the $5.94 per share closing price of the Company’s common stock
on November 25, 2015, the first full trading day following the Company’s announcement of first quarter results for the quarter ending
October 31, 2015.

On March 30, 2016, representatives of Cowen and members of the Company’s management participated in an in-person
introductory meeting at the Company’s headquarters in Norwood, Massachusetts. Members of management gave the representatives of
Cowen a tour of the Company’s facilities, presented a standard overview of the Company’s business and discussed the Company’s
business strategies for growth in the Chinese market. The representatives of Cowen discussed the semiconductor industry generally and
the Chinese semiconductor industry specifically, Cowen’s experience in the semiconductor and electronics industries and various
strategic opportunities that may be available to the Company in connection with its efforts to continue the Company’s growth in the
Chinese market.

On April 13, 2016, a special telephonic meeting of the Board was held at which the Board discussed, among other matters, the
Company’s recent activities and business opportunities, including the Company’s efforts with respect to pursuing strategic partnerships
with Chinese companies, including with respect to the Hong Kong Joint Venture. The Board further discussed the importance of the
Chinese market to the Company and the Company’s potential growth opportunities in China, including the risks, challenges and
benefits of focusing on the Chinese market and the Company’s ability to execute a plan to grow its presence in China without a
strategic or financial partner. The Board also discussed the recent meeting held between members of the Company’s management and
representatives of Cowen and the various strategic opportunities and strategies discussed at such meeting. In light of these
considerations, the Board determined that it was appropriate to continue to explore strategic partnerships and growth opportunities in
the Chinese market and discussed the benefit of engaging a financial advisor to assist the Company in such efforts. In connection with
such determination, the Board determined that its exploration of strategic alternatives would be initially limited to Chinese
counterparties, but that if any such opportunity included an acquisition of the Company, the Board would require as a condition to the
pursuit of such transaction that the definitive agreement providing for such transaction include a customary “go-shop” period. The
Board then engaged in discussion of the qualifications, expertise, experience and reputation of certain investment banks and reviewed
certain information provided by representatives of Cowen with respect to Cowen’s potential engagement by the Company as the
Company’s financial advisor. Upon such discussion and review of information, the Board concluded that Cowen had no material
relationships that would prevent Cowen from serving as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with the Company’s
exploration of potential growth opportunities focused initially in the Chinese market and unanimously approved the engagement of
Cowen to assist the Board in such efforts.

On April 14, 2016, members of the Company’s management and representatives of Cowen participated in a telephonic meeting to
discuss Cowen’s potential engagement in connection with the Company’s exploration of strategic alternatives. Following discussion
and taking into account a review of potential alternatives led by Cowen, members of the Company’s management directed
representatives of Cowen to approach, on the Company’s behalf, a total of seven Chinese parties (the “Initial Potential Partners”),
including Sino IC Capital, each of which was identified by Cowen as a party that may be interested in pursuing a strategic transaction
with the Company and able to assist the Company in its efforts to grow its business in China. During such discussion, the parties noted
certain competitive and confidentiality concerns with respect to soliciting interest from a larger set of potentially interested parties and
members of the Company’s management communicated to the

representatives of Cowen the Board’s requirement that any strategic alternative involving an acquisition of the Company include a
customary “go-shop” period.

On April 19, 2016, pursuant to the Board’s authorization, the Company signed an engagement letter with Cowen, pursuant to
which Cowen served as the Company’s financial advisor in connection with the Company’s exploration and consideration of potential
strategic transactions with a strategic or financial partner. Following Cowen’s engagement, members of the Company’s management
and representatives of Cowen participated in a discussion concerning the Company’s prospects, the state of the semiconductor test
equipment and electronics manufacturing industries and a preliminary review of a range of strategic alternatives for the Company
including continuing as a stand-alone company, pursuing a strategic merger, pursuing a joint venture, pursuing a sale or license with
respect to a segment of the Company’s business and pursuing a sale of the entire company.

Beginning on April 19, 2016, at the request of management of the Company, Cowen approached on behalf of the Company each
of the Initial Potential Partners and, following Cowen’s approach of each such Initial Potential Partner, non-disclosure agreements were
entered into between the Company and each of the Initial Potential Partners (in the case of Sino IC Capital, a non-disclosure agreement
was executed by another of the Initial Potential Partners (“Party B”) which covered discussions with and materials provided to Sino IC
Capital as a potential financing source of Party B).

On May 17, 2016, Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger, and representatives of Cowen participated in an in-person introductory
meeting with representatives of one of the Initial Potential Partners (“Party C”) in Shanghai, China. During the meeting the participants
discussed, among other things, the Company’s business in the context of trends in the semiconductor and semiconductor test equipment
industries and growth opportunities for the Company’s business in the Chinese market. Other than the May 2016 Forecast (as defined
in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger — Management Projections”), Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger did not
provide any non-public information to the participants in the meeting with Party C. Also on May 17, 2016, Messrs. Tacelli and
Gallenberger, together with representatives from Cowen, participated in a meeting with a representative of Sino IC Capital and a
representative of Party B in Shanghai, China. At the meeting the participants discussed, among other matters, the Company’s business
in the context of trends in the semiconductor and semiconductor test equipment industries and growth opportunities for the Company’s
business in the Chinese market. Other than the May 2016 Forecast, Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger did not provide any non-public
information to the participants in the meeting with Sino IC Capital and Party B. None of the discussions held with Party C, Sino IC
Capital or Party B on May 17, 2016, resulted in discussion of any price-related terms of a potential strategic transaction.

On May 18, 2016, Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger and representatives from Cowen met with another of the Initial Potential
Partners (“Party D”) in Beijing, China, to discuss, among other things, the Company’s business in the context of trends in the
semiconductor and semiconductor test equipment industries and growth opportunities for the Company’s business in the Chinese
market. Other than the May 2016 Forecast, Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger did not provide any non-public information to the
participants in the meeting with Party D. None of the discussions held with Party D on May 18, 2016, resulted in discussion of any
price-related terms of a potential strategic transaction.

On May 19, 2016, Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger and representatives of Cowen participated in introductory meetings with two
of the remaining Initial Potential Partners (“Party E” and “Party F,” respectively) in Beijing, China, to discuss, among other things, the
Company’s business in the context of trends in the semiconductor and semiconductor test equipment industries and growth
opportunities for the Company’s business in the Chinese market. Other than the May 2016 Forecast, Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger
did not provide any non-public information to the participants in the meetings with Party E and Party F. None of the discussions held
with Party E or Party F on May 19, 2016, resulted in discussion of any price-related terms of a potential strategic transaction.

On May 20, 2016, Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger and representatives of Cowen participated in an introductory meeting with
one of the remaining Initial Potential Partners (“Party G”) in Beijing, China, to discuss, among other things, the Company’s business in
the context of trends in the semiconductor and semiconductor test equipment industries and growth opportunities for the Company’s
business in the Chinese market. Other than the May 2016 Forecast, Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger did not provide any non-public
information to the participants in the meeting with Party G. None of the discussions held with Party G on May 20, 2016, resulted in
discussion of any price-related terms of a potential strategic transaction. Of the seven Initial Potential Partners, only one such Initial
Potential Partner (“Party H”) declined the opportunity to meet with members of the Company’s management, so members of the
Company’s management did not meet with representatives of Party H.

During the period beginning on May 24, 2016 and continuing through May 29, 2016, representatives of Cowen reached out to
representatives of each of Party C, Party D, Party E, Party F, Party G and Sino IC Capital to further assess each such party’s interest in
pursuing a strategic transaction with the Company. During such period representatives of Party C indicated to representatives of Cowen
that Party C was interested in exploring a potential strategic transaction with the Company. Also during such period, a representative of
Sino IC Capital indicated to representatives of Cowen that Sino IC Capital was interested in exploring a potential strategic transaction
with the Company and that, due to Party B’s much smaller size relative to the Company, Party B would not itself pursue a strategic
transaction with the Company but instead would serve as Sino IC Capital’s technical advisor during Sino IC Capital’s evaluation of
potential strategic transactions involving the Company. During such period, Cowen indicated to the representatives of Party C and the
representative of Sino IC Capital the Board’s expectation that any definitive agreement entered into would include a customary
“go-shop” period during which the Company would be permitted to solicit alternative proposals for a strategic transaction involving
the Company. Each other Initial Potential Partner indicated to Cowen that such party continued to evaluate the opportunity internally.

On May 24, 2016, representatives of Party F expressed to representatives of Cowen that Party F did not have interest in pursuing
a strategic transaction with the Company at that time.

During June 2016, Party C and Sino IC Capital each engaged in due diligence of the Company and its businesses.

On June 2, 2016, the Board held a regularly scheduled meeting, a portion of which was also attended by members of the
Company’s management and a representative of Cowen. The representative of Cowen provided an update to the Board with respect to
feedback received from the Initial Potential Partners following the meetings held with such Initial Potential Partners and members of
the Company’s management in China, including anticipated next steps with Initial Potential Partners that had expressed interest in
continuing discussions with the Company regarding a potential strategic transaction.

On June 6, 2016, the Company publicly announced its third quarter results for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2016, which
indicated a 14% increase in net sales to $82.2 million for the third quarter of the Company’s 2016 fiscal year as compared to
$72.3 million of net sales in the second quarter of the Company’s 2016 fiscal year, GAAP net income of $0.06 per diluted share and
non-GAAP net income of $0.00 per diluted share. On the same date, members of the Company’s management participated in an
investor conference call during which the Company’s guidance for the fourth quarter of its fiscal year was discussed, which included
net sales in the range of $89 million to $93 million and non-GAAP net income in the range of $0.07 to $0.10 per diluted share. The
closing price of the Company’s common stock on the first full day of trading following announcement of the third quarter’s results was
$6.73 per share, up approximately 16% from the $5.80 per share closing price of the Company’s common stock on February 26, 2016,
the first full trading day following the Company’s announcement of second quarter results for the quarter ending January 31, 2016.

On June 14, 2016, representatives of Party D and Party E, respectively, each indicated to representatives of Cowen that such party
did not have interest in pursuing a strategic transaction with the Company at that time.

On July 5, 2016, Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger participated in a discussion with representatives of Party C to answer certain
diligence questions raised by Party C.

On July 20, 2016, representatives of Party G indicated to representatives of Cowen that Party G was interested in participating in
further due diligence efforts with respect to the Company and its businesses.    

On July 21, 2016, representatives of Party C indicated to representatives of Cowen that Party C was not interested in pursuing a
strategic transaction with the Company at that time.

On July 29, 2016, members of the Company’s management, representatives of Cowen, representatives of Sino IC Capital, a
representative of Party B, representatives of Sino IC Capital’s financial advisor (“Sino IC Capital Financial Advisor”) and
representatives of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, outside counsel to Sino IC Capital (“Wilson”), participated in an in-person
meeting in Norwood, Massachusetts. During the meeting, members of the Company’s management presented an overview of the
Company’s business, including a review of its sales in recent periods and technical roadmaps, and representatives of Sino IC Capital
gave a presentation of Sino IC Capital, including its size, investment history, and presence in the Chinese semiconductor market.

On August 19, 2016, representatives of Sino IC Capital Financial Advisor delivered to representatives of Cowen a non-binding
offer for Sino IC Capital to acquire 100% of the outstanding common stock of the Company at a price per share of $7.75 in cash (the
“Initial IOI”). The closing price of the Company’s common stock on August 19, 2016 was $6.08 per share.

On August 25, 2016, the Board held a telephonic meeting which was also attended by members of the Company’s management
and a representative of Cowen. At that meeting, the participants discussed the Initial IOI. The representative of Cowen reviewed with
the Board an update on the discussions to date with each of the Initial Potential Partners with whom members of management had met,
certain market data compiled by Cowen and a summary of potential next steps in the process of the Board’s exploration of strategic
alternatives. Colin Savoy, the Company’s chief legal counsel, advised the Board as to its fiduciary duties in the context of an
assessment of the Initial IOI and any other strategic transaction. After discussion, the Board determined that, although the price per
share conveyed in the Initial IOI was insufficient, the Company should continue to engage with Sino IC Capital, and the Board directed
the representative from Cowen to convey to Sino IC Capital that the Board believed the purchase price offered in the Initial IOI was
insufficient and further directed the representative from Cowen to convey to representatives of Sino IC Capital Financial Advisor a
counterproposal at $14.00 per share. The Board also established a Strategic Transaction Committee (the “Strategic Committee”), the
purpose of which was to assist and make recommendations to the Board and the Company’s management with respect to the
day-to-day decisions as to process and strategy concerning an assessment of any potential strategic transaction, including with Sino IC
Capital or its related parties. The Board appointed Roger Blethen and Jorge Titinger as members of the Strategic Committee. The
Board indicated that all substantive decisions regarding any potential strategic transaction would be made by the entire Board.

On August 27, 2016, representatives of Cowen communicated to representatives of Sino IC Capital Financial Advisor that the
Board believed the per share purchase price set forth in the Initial IOI was insufficient and that the Board believed that the per share
purchase price should be closer to $14.00 per share. Representatives of Sino IC Capital Financial Advisor indicated to representatives
of Cowen that $14.00 per share was too high and would be rejected by Sino IC Capital.

On August 29, 2016, the Strategic Committee held a telephonic meeting which was also attended by two of the other members of
the Board and members of the Company’s management. At that meeting, the participants discussed the Initial IOI, the rejected
counterproposal made by the Company and communicated to Sino IC Capital Financial Advisor by Cowen and a formal response to be
provided to Sino IC Capital with respect to the Initial IOI to the effect that the per share purchase price in the Initial IOI was
insufficient and that the Company

would require a higher purchase price to continue discussions with Sino IC Capital (the “Initial Response”). Following discussion, the
members of the Strategic Committee approved the Initial Response to Sino IC Capital with respect to the Initial IOI and directed
management to deliver the Initial Response to representatives of Sino IC Capital. Later on August 29, 2016, members of the
Company’s management delivered the Initial Response to representatives of Sino IC Capital.

On September 1, 2016, Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger participated in a meeting with representatives of Party G at the
Company’s headquarters in Norwood, Massachusetts. During such meeting, Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger gave a presentation of
the Company’s business, discussed the state of the semiconductor equipment industry in China and provided a tour of the Company’s
plant and the representatives of Party G provided an overview of Party G’s business and discussed the possibility of forming a joint
venture with the Company in China. Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger indicated to the representatives of Party G that, although Messrs.
Tacelli and Gallenberger appreciated Party G’s proposal with respect to a joint venture, they did not believe that such a joint venture
would result in meaningful value to the Company or meaningfully further the Company’s objectives and, as such, the Company was
not in a position to pursue a joint venture with Company G.

Also on September 1, 2016, the Company publicly announced its fourth quarter results for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2016,
which indicated a 11% increase in net sales to $91.2 million for the fourth quarter of the Company’s 2016 fiscal year as compared to
$82.2 million of net sales in the third quarter of the Company’s 2016 fiscal year, GAAP net income of $0.13 per diluted share and
non-GAAP net income of $0.12 per diluted share. On the same date, members of the Company’s management participated in an
investor conference call during which the Company’s guidance for the first quarter of its 2017 fiscal year was discussed, which
included net sales in the range of $80 million to $84 million and non-GAAP net loss or income in the range of -$0.03 to $0.01,
respectively, per diluted share. The closing price of the Company’s common stock on the first full day of trading following
announcement of the second quarter’s results was $5.83 per share, down approximately 13% from the $6.73 per share closing price of
the Company’s common stock on June 6, 2016, the first full trading day following the Company’s announcement of third quarter
results for the quarter ending April 30, 2016.

respect to the per share purchase price set forth in the Initial IOI relative to the market position of the Company and recent transactions
in the semiconductor industry. During such communications, Mr. Tacelli reiterated to representatives of Sino IC Capital the Board’s
belief that the per share purchase price set forth in the Initial IOI was insufficient in light of the Company’s business and potential in
the Chinese market.

On September 9, 2016, representatives of Cowen participated in a telephonic discussion with representatives of Sino IC Capital
Financial Advisor to discuss matters with respect to the proposed strategic transaction involving Sino IC Capital and the Company,
including valuation matters, and indicated to Sino IC Capital Financial Advisor that the Board would require a higher per share
purchase price in order to continue discussions with Sino IC Capital regarding a potential strategic transaction.

On September 15, 2016, representatives of Sino IC Capital Financial Advisor communicated to representatives of Cowen Sino IC
Capital’s revised non-binding verbal offer for Sino IC Capital to acquire 100% of the outstanding common stock of the Company at a
price per share of $8.50 in cash (the “Revised IOI”). The closing price of the Company’s common stock on September 15, 2016 was
$5.68 per share.

agreement and related matters. Mr. Tacelli gave an overview of the agenda of the meeting and provided an update on the Company’s
business and business prospects. Representatives of Latham & Watkins then gave an overview and update of negotiations of the
proposed transaction and the structure of the proposed transaction.

Representatives of Latham & Watkins then gave a presentation regarding the Board’s fiduciary duties in the context of
considering the Company’s strategic alternatives and the proposed transaction with Unic Capital. Representatives of Latham & Watkins
then reviewed with the Board a summary of transaction terms that was circulated to each member of the Board in advance of the
meeting and gave a presentation that summarized the terms of the merger agreement, Equity Commitment Letter, Debt Commitment
Letter and Letter of Guarantee. Representatives of Latham & Watkins then discussed certain provisions of the merger agreement
related to the Board’s ability to solicit alternative transactions during the “go-shop” period and to accept a superior proposal and enter
into an alternative transaction in the exercise of the Board’s fiduciary duties.

Following the presentation of Latham & Watkins, Mr. Tacelli discussed with the Board the parties’ efforts with respect to certain
regulatory approvals required pursuant to the merger agreement, including each party’s obligations with respect thereto under the
merger agreement, the Company’s strategy and steps taken to date in furtherance of obtaining such regulatory approvals following the
execution of the merger agreement, including the possibility of engaging consultants to assist in the Company’s efforts.

Representatives of Cowen reviewed with the Board its financial analysis of the proposed consideration of $10.25 per share, an
earlier version of which was circulated to each member of the Board on April 5, 2017, and responded to questions from members of the
Board regarding its financial analysis. Cowen then delivered its opinion to the Board to the effect that, as of April 7, 2017, and subject
to the various assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the consideration of $10.25 per share to be received by the stockholders of
the Company in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders, other than Parent and its affiliates. The
opinion of Cowen is more fully described below under the heading “The Merger — Opinion of Cowen and Company LLC” beginning
on page 62.

Representatives of Cowen then reviewed with the Board a presentation that had been circulated to each member of the Board
prior to the meeting concerning the “go-shop” period and Cowen’s process of soliciting additional interest for a strategic transaction
involving the Company. Cowen’s presentation included a summary of immediate actions that Cowen would take upon execution of the
merger agreement, a summary of the process for receiving and reviewing acquisition proposals, and a list of parties that might be
capable of, and might be interested in, pursuing an acquisition of the Company and from whom Cowen would solicit interest.

After considering the proposed terms of the merger agreement, Equity Commitment Letter, Debt Commitment Letter and Letter
of Guarantee and the presentations of each of Latham & Watkins and Cowen, including the receipt of Cowen’s oral opinion, and taking
into account the other factors described in this proxy statement under the section entitled “Reasons for the Merger and
Recommendation of the Board,” management of the Company gave its recommendation to the Board that the merger agreement and
the transactions provided for in the merger agreement, were advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
Following Company management’s recommendation, representatives of Latham & Watkins reviewed the proposed resolutions of the
Board that had been provided to the Board prior to the meeting and which provided for the Board’s approval of the merger agreement
and authorized the execution, delivery and performance of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement.

Following review of the proposed resolutions, the Board engaged in discussion concerning the considerations supporting entry
into the merger agreement and certain factors that may not support entry into the merger agreement, including such factors as are
described in this proxy statement under the section entitled “Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Board.” Following
such discussion, the Board unanimously determined that the merger agreement, in the form presented to the Board, and the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, were fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders. The Board then authorized and directed management to execute, deliver and perform the merger agreement and
recommended that the Company’s stockholders approve the merger agreement and the Merger. The Board then directed Cowen, upon
the execution and delivery of the merger agreement to Unic Capital and Sponsor, to begin its “go-shop” outreach process as discussed
earlier and reflected in Cowen’s presentation. Representatives of Latham & Watkins then provided a timeline of announcements and
other media events, as well as certain required public filings, related to the Company’s entry into the merger agreement. Following
such overview, the Board unanimously approved the issuance of a joint press release with Sino IC Capital announcing entry into the
merger agreement and the transactions related thereto.

Following the Board meeting on April 7, 2017, the merger agreement and related documents were executed and delivered by the
Company, Unic Capital and the other applicable parties. On April 7, 2017, the last full trading day before the announcement of the
transaction, the Company’s common stock closed at a price of $9.00 per share.

The Company and Sino IC Capital issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement and the related
documents before the open of trading of the Company’s common stock on April 8, 2017.

During the go-shop period, at the direction and under the supervision of the Board and members of the Company’s management,
representatives of Cowen contacted parties that, in the view of the Board, might be capable of, and might be interested in, pursuing an
acquisition of the Company. During the go-shop period, and at the direction of the Board, representatives of Cowen contacted a total of
55 parties, including 33 strategic parties and 22 financial sponsors, to solicit their interest in a possible acquisition of the Company. Of
the 55 parties contacted by representatives of Cowen, one party (“Party I”) executed a confidentiality agreement and was granted
access to certain non-public information regarding the Company. On April 14, 2017, Party I indicated to members of the Company’s
management that Party I was not interested in pursuing a strategic transaction involving the Company.

On May 12, 2017, the go-shop period expired pursuant to terms of the Merger Agreement. None of the 55 parties contacted
during the go-shop period, nor any other party, has submitted an alternative acquisition proposal to the Company as of the date of this
proxy statement.

In connection with the preparation of this proxy statement, Cowen became aware that the Company’s “Non-GAAP EPS” amounts
used to perform portions of Cowen’s Analysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies and Analysis of Selected Transactions, as set
forth in Cowen’s presentation to the Board on April 7, 2017 and as more fully described below under the heading “The
Merger — Opinion of Cowen and Company LLC” beginning on page 62, did not exclude stock-based compensation expense. Using
the Company’s Non-GAAP EPS amounts that excluded stock-based compensation expense, Cowen subsequently re-performed the
portions of its Analysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies and Analysis of Selected Transactions that utilized such Non-GAAP
EPS amounts.

On May 31, 2017, the Board held a regularly scheduled telephonic meeting, which was attended by members of the Company’s
management, representatives of Latham & Watkins and representatives of Cowen. At such meeting, at the Board’s request,
representatives of Cowen reviewed with the Board its financial analysis of the proposed consideration of $10.25 per share, including
the portions of its Analysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies and Analysis of Selected Transactions that utilized the Non-GAAP
EPS amounts that excluded stock based compensation expense, and the differences between such analyses and the analyses set forth in
its presentation to the Board on April 7, 2017. Representatives of Cowen responded to questions from members of the Board regarding
such analyses and Cowen confirmed to the Board that, had Cowen performed its financial analyses set forth in its presentation on
April 7, 2017 using the Non-GAAP EPS amounts excluding stock-based compensation expense, there would have been no change to
the conclusion set forth in the written opinion of Cowen. Following this presentation, the Board met in executive session with
representatives of Latham & Watkins and determined that the revised analyses provided by Cowen did not impact its recommendation
in favor of the merger.

On August 4, 2017, Unic Capital Management Co., Ltd. (“Unic Capital”), Hubei Xinyan Equity Investment Partnership (Limited
Partnership) (“Parent”) and Xcerra Corporation (the “Company”) entered into that certain Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the
“Merger Assignment Agreement”) pursuant to section 9.3 of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 7, 2017, by
and among Unic Capital, China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Co., Ltd. (“Sponsor”) and the Company (the “Merger
Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Assignment Agreement, Unic Capital has irrevocably transferred,
conveyed, assigned and delivered to Parent all of Unic Capital’s right, interests, benefits, liabilities and obligations in and under the
Merger Agreement (the “Merger Assignment”) and Parent has accepted the Merger Assignment and assumed and agreed to pay,
perform, fulfill and discharge all obligations and liabilities of Unic Capital arising under or relating to the Merger Agreement;
provided, however, that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Merger Assignment does not relieve Unic Capital from the
performance of its obligations under the Merger Agreement in the event Parent does not perform all of such obligations.

Also, on August 4, 2017, Unic Capital, Parent, Sponsor and the Company entered into that certain Assignment and Assumption
Agreement (the “Equity Assignment Agreement”) pursuant to that certain Equity Commitment Letter Agreement, dated as of April 7,
2017, by and between Unic Capital and Sponsor (the “Equity Letter Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity
Assignment Agreement, Unic Capital has irrevocably transferred, conveyed, assigned and delivered to Parent all of Unic Capital’s
right, interests, benefits, liabilities and obligations in and under the Equity Letter Agreement (the “Equity Assignment”) and Parent has
accepted the Equity Assignment and assumed and agreed to pay, perform, fulfill and discharge all obligations and liabilities of Unic
Capital arising under or relating to the Equity Letter Agreement.

Also, on August 4, 2017, Unic Capital, Parent, Sino IC Leasing Co., Ltd. (the “Lender”) and the Company entered into that
certain Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the “Debt Assignment Agreement”) pursuant to that certain Debt Commitment Letter
Agreement, dated as of April 7, 2017, by and between Unic Capital and the Lender (the “Debt Letter Agreement”). Pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the Debt Assignment Agreement, Unic Capital has irrevocably transferred, conveyed, assigned and delivered
to Parent all of Unic Capital’s right, interests, benefits, liabilities and obligations in and under the Debt Letter Agreement (the “Debt
Assignment”) and Parent has accepted the Debt Assignment and assumed and agreed to pay, perform, fulfill and discharge all
obligations and liabilities of Unic Capital arising under or relating to the Debt Letter Agreement.

Also, on August 4, 2017, Parent, Sponsor and the Company entered into that certain Amendment to the Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the “Amendment Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Amendment Agreement, the words “wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent” in the first paragraph of the Recitals, the second paragraph of the Recitals, Section 2.1, Section 6.19 and Section
9.3 of the Merger Agreement were deleted in their entirety and replaced by the words “controlled Subsidiary of Parent.”

Reasons for the Merger and Recommendation of the Board

At a meeting on April 7, 2017, the Board unanimously:
 

 
•  determined that the terms of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were fair to, and

in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders;
 

 
•  determined that it was in the best interests of the company and its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the

Merger Agreement;

covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained therein; and

 

 
•  resolved to recommend that the holders of shares of the Company’s common stock adopt the Merger Agreement in

In the course of reaching its determination, the Board held numerous meetings and consulted with our senior management,

information and data, each of which the Board believed supported its decisions, but which are not listed in any relative order of
importance:
 

 
•  information concerning our business, financial performance (both historical and projected) and our financial condition,

results of operations (both historical and projected), and business strategic objectives, as well as the risks of accomplishing
those objectives;

 

 
•  the fact that the Per Share Merger Consideration of $10.25 per share represents a significant premium to the then current and

historical market prices of the Company’s common stock as follows:
 

 
•  an approximately 13.8% premium to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on April 7, 2017, the last

trading day prior to the date on which the Company entered into the Merger Agreement;

•  an approximately 16% premium to the average closing price of the Company’s common stock in the 30 trading day

period ending on the date on which the Company entered into the Merger Agreement; and
 

 
•  an approximately 28% premium to the average closing price of the Company’s common stock in the 90 trading day

period ending on the date on which the Company entered into the Merger Agreement;
 

 

•  reasonably possible alternatives to the Merger, including remaining an independent publicly-traded company or pursuing
another bidder, the potential benefits to the Company’s stockholders of these alternatives and the timing and likelihood of
accomplishing the goals of such alternatives, as well as the Board’s assessment that none of these alternatives was
reasonably likely to present a superior opportunity for the Company to create greater value for the Company’s stockholders,
taking into account the risks of execution as well as business, competitive, industry and market risks;

 

 
•  the risks and uncertainties associated with the Company remaining an independent company compared to the opportunities

presented by the Merger, including the risks and uncertainties with respect to:
 

 
•  the Company achieving its growth plans in light of the current and future market conditions, including the risks and

uncertainties in the U.S. and global economy generally and the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment
industries specifically;

 

 
•  the intensely competitive nature of the semiconductor equipment and electronics manufacturing industries in which

the Company competes;
 

 
•  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the corresponding fluctuations in the Company’s financial

results and the market price of the Company’s common stock over the last 12 months and the last several years;
 

 •  consolidation trends within the semiconductor industry;
 

 •  the Company’s dependence on a highly concentrated customer base;
 

 
•  the fluctuations in the Company’s sales and operating results in recent periods and its prospects for future growth, and

the general risks associated with the Company’s ability to execute on a business plan that would create stockholder
value in excess of the Per Share Merger Consideration;

 

 
•  the significant lead-time and expenses of developing new products and our ability to anticipate the technical needs of

our customers;
 

 
•  the importance of scale in a competitive market environment and the associated challenges to growth as a smaller

independent company;
 

 
•  the dependence of the Company on subcontractors and sole source suppliers for the manufacture of the

subcomponents and subassemblies used to produce the Company’s test products and the business risks associated with
such a dependency;

 

 
•  the dependence of the Company on a limited number of suppliers for some components and sub-assemblies, and the

risk of supply shortages or loss of suppliers;
 

 
•  the dependence of the Company on international sales for a significant portion of the Company’s revenue in recent

periods and the business risks associated with such a dependency;
 

 •  the general risks and market conditions that could affect the price of the Company’s common stock; and
 

 
•  the other “risk factors” set forth in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2017, and

subsequent reports filed with the SEC;
 

 
•  the possibility that, as a result of the foregoing or other risks, it could take a considerable period of time before the trading

price of the Company’s common stock would reach and sustain a price per share that

is equal to, or greater than, the Per Share Merger Consideration of $10.25 per share, as adjusted for the time value of money,
and that the Company’s common stock may never reach such a price;

 

 
•  estimated forecasts of the Company’s future financial performance prepared by the Company’s management, together with

management’s view of the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, business, prospects and competitive position
and the ability to achieve the performance set forth in such forecasts;

 

 
•  the negotiations with respect to the Per Share Merger Consideration including the determination by the Board that, following

negotiations with Parent, $10.25 per share was the highest price that Parent would agree to pay;
 

 

•  the financial analyses presented to the Board by Cowen with respect to the Merger and the written opinion of Cowen to the
Board to the effect that, as of April 7, 2017, and subject to the various assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the
consideration of $10.25 per share to be received by the stockholders of the Company in the Merger was fair, from a financial
point of view, to such stockholders, other than Parent and its affiliates. The full text of the Opinion is attached hereto as
Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference and in its entirety. The Opinion is more fully described
below under the heading “The Merger — Opinion of Cowen and Company, LLC” beginning on page 62;

 

 

•  the ability of Company management to furnish information to, and conduct negotiations with, third parties in certain
circumstances following the expiration of the go-shop period, and to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior
proposal upon payment of a $22,800,000 termination fee (which our Board believed was reasonable under the
circumstances) from third parties who did not submit acquisition proposals during the go-shop period;

 

 
•  the absence of any credible acquisition proposal with a higher price to the Company’s stockholders, and, in particular, the

absence of any such credible acquisition proposal following the expiration of the go-shop period and after contacts with
multiple other parties regarding a potential acquisition;

 

 
•  the belief of the Board that the terms of the Merger Agreement, including the representations, warranties, covenants and the

closing conditions, are reasonable and in the best interests of the Company’s stockholders;
 

 •  the likelihood that the Merger would be completed based on, among other things (not in any relative order of importance):
 

 
•  the conditions to closing set forth in the Merger Agreement and the absence of a financing condition in the Merger

Agreement; and
 

 
•  the fact that the Merger Agreement provides that, under certain circumstances, in the event of a failure of the Merger

to be completed, Parent will be required to pay the Company a termination fee in an amount of $14,250,000
or $22,800,000 (as further explained in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees”);

 

 
•  the fact that the Company’s financial and legal advisors were involved during the process and negotiations and updated the

Board directly and regularly, which provided the Board with additional perspectives on the process and negotiations;
 

 

•  the Company’s ability, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement (including the payment
of a termination fee as further explained in the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees”), to make a
change in its recommendation to the Company’s stockholders with respect to the adoption of the Merger Agreement or
terminate the Merger Agreement during certain periods prior to the completion of the Merger to accept any acquisition
proposal from a third party that is a superior proposal (as defined in and further explained in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement — Go-Shop Period; Alternative Acquisition Proposals”);

•  the ability of the Board to make a change in its recommendation to the Company’s stockholders with respect to the adoption

of the Merger Agreement due to a intervening event (as defined in and further explained in the section entitled “The Merger
Agreement — The Board’s Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change”);

 

 

•  the availability of statutory dissenters’ rights under Massachusetts law to holders of the Company’s common stock who do
not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and comply with all of the required procedures under
Massachusetts law, which provides those stockholders with an opportunity to accept the fair market value of their shares (as
determined pursuant to Massachusetts’ law), which may be more than, less than, or the same as the amount such
stockholders would have received under the Merger Agreement;

 

 

•  the commitments of the Sponsor and Lender to provide equity or debt financing to Parent, at or prior to the Effective Time,
sufficient to fund the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (as further explained in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger — Financing of the Merger”) and the payment guarantee received from the Bank of
Beijing Co., Ltd. with respect to Parent’s obligation to pay the termination fee if the Merger Agreement is terminated in
certain circumstances (as further explained under the section entitled “The Merger Agreement —Termination Fees”);

 

 
•  representations by Parent and Merger Sub in the Merger Agreement that, assuming the accuracy of the Company’s

representations in the Merger Agreement, the aggregate proceeds represented by the financing commitments will be
sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to pay all amounts required to be paid in connection with the Merger;

 

 
•  our entitlement to specific performance under certain circumstances to cause the equity financing and the debt financing to

be funded;
 

 
•  the other terms of the Merger Agreement, including the parties’ representations, warranties and covenants, the conditions to

their respective obligations and the termination rights of the parties;
 

 
•  the fact that the proposed Per Share Merger Consideration is all cash, which provides certainty of value and liquidity to the

Company’s stockholders for their shares of the Company’s common stock; and
 

 
•  that the members of the Board were unanimous in their determination to recommend the Merger Agreement for adoption by

the Company’s stockholders.

The Board also considered a variety of potentially negative factors concerning the Merger Agreement and the Merger, which are
listed below in no relative order of importance:
 

 

•  the fact that the Company’s stockholders will have no ongoing equity participation in the Company following the Merger,
and that they will cease to participate in the Company’s future earnings or growth, if any, or to benefit from increases, if any,
in the value of the Company’s common stock, and will not participate in any potential future sale of the Company to a third
party or any potential recapitalization of the Company;

 

 
•  the fact that completion of the merger will require antitrust clearance in the United States and potentially in certain other

foreign countries, and CFIUS approval;
 

 
•  the risk that the Merger may not receive required government approvals in the PRC or Taiwan, or that other conditions to the

parties’ obligations to complete the Merger will not be satisfied, and as a result, the possibility that the Merger may not be
completed even if the Merger Agreement is approved by the Company’s stockholders;

 

 
•  the potential negative effects of the public announcement of the Merger on our sales, operating results and stock price, our

ability to retain key management, sales and marketing, technical and other personnel, and our relationships with customers,
suppliers and regulators;

Table of Contents

 
•  the risks and substantial costs to the Company if the Merger does not close, including the diversion of management and

employee attention, potential employee attrition and the potential disruptive effect on the Company’s business and customer
relationships;

 

 

•  the possibility that we may be obligated to pay Parent a termination fee of (1) $14,250,000 in the event that we terminate the
Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement related to a superior proposal with a person or group that submitted a
bona fide written acquisition proposal during the go-shop period that satisfies the requirements enumerated in the Merger
Agreement or (2) $22,800,000 in certain other circumstances in which the Merger Agreement is terminated (each as further
explained under the section entitled “The Merger Agreement — Termination Fees”);

 

 
•  the fact that the termination fees payable by Parent are only available in certain instances in which the Merger Agreement is

terminated;
 

 •  the fact that the Company’s stockholders may not approve the Merger;
 

 
•  the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to complete the Merger and the right of Parent to terminate the

Merger Agreement under certain circumstances;
 

 
•  the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the Merger, requiring us to conduct our business

in the ordinary course and preventing us from taking certain specified actions, subject to specific limitations, all of which
may delay or prevent us from undertaking business opportunities pending completion of the Merger;

 

 
•  the risk that the Merger may not be consummated or that the closing may be unduly delayed, even if the requisite approval is

obtained from the Company’s stockholders, including the possibility that closing conditions in the Merger Agreement may
not be satisfied;

 

 
•  the fact that the receipt of cash by the Company’s stockholders in exchange for their shares of the Company’s common stock

pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes as described below in “The
Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequence of the Merger;” and

 

 
•  the fact that, should additional time be needed to obtain required regulatory approvals to close the Merger, Parent may

extend the termination date from eight months to fourteen months, further exacerbating any potential negative effects on the
Company and its business during the period between the signing and termination of the Merger Agreement.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Board is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the
material factors considered by the Board. In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the
Merger and the complexity of these matters, the Board did not find it useful to and did not attempt to quantify, rank, or otherwise
assign relative weights to these factors. In addition, the Board did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any
particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination, but, rather, the Board
conducted an overall analysis of the factors described above, including discussions with the Company’s management and its financial
and legal advisors. In considering the factors described above, individual members of the Board may have given different weights to
different factors.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, “FOR” the
proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there
are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting and “FOR” the proposal to approve, by
non-binding, advisory vote, compensation that will or may become payable to the Company’s named executive officers in
connection with the Merger.

Management Projections

In the normal course of business planning, in early May or June of each year the Company’s management prepares, for internal
use, certain unaudited prospective financial information with respect to the Company’s business plans for the immediately succeeding
fiscal year (the “Annual Operating Plan” or “AOP”). The AOP is based on a “bottoms-up” analysis of the Company’s prospects, with
input from the managers of each of the Company’s business units. This prospective information is part of the Company’s annual
internal planning and performance goal setting processes and is discussed, reviewed and approved by the Board annually.

In connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Company’s management
updated and expanded certain financial forecasts regarding the Company (for the purposes of this section, the “Forecasts” means each
of the May 2016 Forecast, August 2016 Forecast, February 2017 Forecast and the Extended Forecast, each as described below). In
developing the Forecasts, the Company’s management made assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business,
economic, regulatory, litigation, geopolitical, market and financial conditions, as well as Company specific factors such as supply and
demand trends and the status of, and estimated revenues from, new products and services, all of which are difficult to predict, and
many of which are beyond the Company’s control. The Forecasts were updated on a different basis, for a different purpose and at a
different time than the Company’s public guidance as to the Company’s annual financial performance and on a different basis, for a
different purpose and at a different time than other internal financial forecasts that the Company’s management may prepare for its own
use or for the use of the Board in evaluating the Company’s business. The Forecasts were therefore updated solely in connection with
the evaluation of the Merger and do not, and were not intended to, update or revise the Company’s public guidance as to its annual
performance.

The following is a summary of the Forecasts.

The May 2016 Forecast

The May 2016 Forecast was prepared by the Company’s management in the ordinary course of business for use at the Board’s
June 2, 2016 meeting for purposes of evaluating the Company’s business and included projections for the Company’s fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2017. The May 2016 Forecast included a three year forecast for the Company’s fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 and was
prepared on a by-customer basis and was based upon certain assumptions regarding Company specific factors such as supply and
demand trends and the status of estimated revenues from new products and services, and general business, market and financial
conditions. The May 2016 Forecast was delivered by members of the Company’s management to representatives of Sino IC Capital.
The May 2016 Forecast was prepared on a stand-alone basis and therefore does not reflect any effect of a potential acquisition of the
Company by Sino IC Capital, any of its affiliates or related parties or any other party or any other strategic transaction involving the
Company. The below table is a summary of the May 2016 Forecast.

(1) Figures exclude discontinued operations (Board business divestiture), inventory step-up, amortization of acquired intangible
assets, restructuring charges, non-cash income or expenses, and other one-time items.

(2) FY2014 estimates, excluding Adjusted EBITDA, assume that Multitest and ECT businesses were owned by Xcerra for the entire
fiscal year.

(3) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP metric and represents GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude interest income or expense,
income tax benefit or expense, depreciation and amortization, inventory step-up, amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-

The August 2016 Forecast

The August 2016 Forecast was prepared by the Company’s management in the ordinary course of business for use at the Board’s
August 25, 2016 meeting for purposes of evaluating the Company’s business and included projections for the Company’s fiscal year
2017. The August 2016 Forecast reflects reduced revenue forecasts for 2017 based on a decrease in projected revenue of 7% as
compared to those projected in the May 2016 Forecast as a result of lower than expected overall market demand. The August 2016
Forecast also reflects preliminary actual results for the Company’s fiscal year 2016. The August 2016 Forecast was shared with
representatives of Cowen and was delivered by members of the Company’s management to representatives of Sino IC Capital in
October 2016. The August 2016 Forecast was prepared on a stand-alone basis and therefore does not reflect any effect of a potential
acquisition of the Company by Sino IC Capital, any of its affiliates or related parties or any other party or any other strategic
transaction involving the Company. The below table is a summary of the August 2016 Forecast.

2016 Forecast. The updated projections contained in the February 2017 Forecast reflected slightly decreased operating expenses for
fiscal year 2017, as compared to the August 2016 Forecast, resulting from Company management’s updated cost assumptions for fiscal
year 2017 and slightly increased EBITDA as a result thereof. The February 2017 Forecast was delivered by representatives of Cowen,

The Extended Forecast

The Extended Forecast was prepared by the Company based on the February 2017 Forecast. In order to provide forecasts for the
remainder of fiscal year 2017 and five full future fiscal years, the financial projections in the February 2017 Forecast were extended
through 2022. Cowen was instructed to use and rely on the Extended Forecast as the basis for its analyses in rendering its opinion
described in this proxy statement under the heading “The Merger — Opinion of Cowen and Company, LLC,” and Cowen did use the
Extended Forecast in connection with its analyses. The Extended Forecast was prepared on a stand-alone basis and therefore does not
include any transaction-related expenses nor does it reflect any effect of an acquisition of the Company by Parent, any of its affiliates
or any other party or any other strategic transaction involving the Company. The below table is a summary of the Extended Forecast.

Opinion of Cowen and Company, LLC

The Company retained Cowen to act as its exclusive financial advisor in connection with certain potential strategic transactions,
including a possible sale of, or other business combination involving, the Company, and to render an opinion to the Board as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration of $10.25 per share to be received by the stockholders of the Company in
the Merger.

On April 7, 2017, Cowen delivered its opinion to the Board to the effect that, as of that date and subject to the various
assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the consideration of $10.25 per share to be received by the stockholders of the Company
in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such stockholders, other than Parent and its affiliates. The full text of the
written opinion of Cowen, dated April 7, 2017, is attached as Annex B-1 hereto and is incorporated by reference. The Company
encourages stockholders to read the opinion in its entirety for the assumptions made, procedures followed, other matters
considered and limits of the review by Cowen. The summary of the written opinion of Cowen set forth herein is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. Cowen’s analyses and opinion were prepared for and addressed to the
Board and are directed only to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration of $10.25 per share to be
received by the stockholders of the Company in the Merger, other than Parent and its affiliates. Cowen’s opinion is not a
recommendation to any stockholder or any other person as to how to vote with respect to the Merger or to take any other
action in connection with the Merger or otherwise.

In arriving at its opinion, Cowen reviewed and considered such financial and other matters as it deemed relevant, including,
among other things:
 

 •  a draft of the Merger Agreement dated April 4, 2017;
 

 
•  certain publicly available financial and other information for the Company and certain other relevant financial and operating

data furnished to Cowen by the management of the Company;
 

 
•  certain internal financial analyses, financial forecasts, reports and other information concerning the Company prepared by

the management of the Company (referred to in this section as the “Company Forecasts”);
 

 
•  discussions Cowen had with certain members of the management of the Company concerning the historical and current

business operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company and such other matters Cowen deemed relevant;
 

 
•  certain operating results of the Company as compared to the operating results of certain publicly traded companies Cowen

deemed relevant;
 

 
•  the reported price and trading history of the shares of the common stock of the Company as compared to the reported price

and trading histories of certain publicly traded companies Cowen deemed relevant;
 

 
•  certain financial terms of the Merger as compared to the financial terms of certain selected business combinations Cowen

deemed relevant; and
 

 
•  such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and such other factors that Cowen deemed relevant for

the purposes of its opinion.

In conducting its review and arriving at its opinion, Cowen, with the consent of the Board, assumed and relied, without
independent investigation, upon the accuracy and completeness of all financial and other information provided to it by the Company or
which was publicly available or was otherwise reviewed by Cowen. Cowen did not undertake any responsibility for the accuracy,
completeness or reasonableness of, or independent verification of, such information. Cowen relied upon, without independent
verification, the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing products and services of the Company and the

viability of, and risks associated with, the future products and services of the Company. In addition, Cowen did not conduct, or assume
any obligation to conduct, any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company. Cowen further relied upon the
Company’s representation that all information provided to it by the Company was accurate and complete in all material respects.
Cowen, with the consent of the Board, assumed that the Company Forecasts were reasonably prepared by the management of the
Company on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of such management as to the future
performance of the Company, and that such forecasts provided a reasonable basis for its opinion. Cowen expressed no opinion as to the
Company Forecasts or the assumptions on which they were made. Cowen expressly disclaimed any undertaking or obligation to advise
any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting its opinion of which Cowen became aware after the date of its opinion.

Cowen assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, business or
prospects of the Company since the date of the last financial statements made available to Cowen. Cowen did not make or obtain any
independent evaluations, valuations or appraisals of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor was Cowen furnished with such
materials. In addition, Cowen did not evaluate the solvency or fair value of the Company, Parent, Sponsor or Merger Sub under any
state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Cowen’s opinion does not address any legal, tax or
accounting matters related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger, as to which it assumed that the Company and the Board have
received such advice from legal, tax and accounting advisors as each has determined appropriate. Cowen’s opinion addressed only the
fairness of the consideration of $10.25 per share, from a financial point of view, to the stockholders of the Company, other than Parent
and its affiliates. Cowen expressed no view as to any other aspect or implication of the Merger or any other agreement, arrangement or
understanding entered into in connection with the Merger or otherwise. Cowen’s opinion was necessarily based upon economic and
market conditions and other circumstances as they existed and could be evaluated by Cowen on the date of its opinion. It should be
understood that although subsequent developments may affect Cowen’s opinion, Cowen does not have any obligation to update, revise
or reaffirm its opinion and expressly disclaims any responsibility to do so. Cowen did not consider any potential legislative or
regulatory changes currently being considered or recently enacted by the United States or any foreign government, or any domestic or
foreign regulatory body, or any changes in accounting methods or generally accepted accounting principles that may be adopted by the
SEC, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or any similar foreign regulatory body or board.

For purposes of rendering its opinion, Cowen assumed, in all respects material to its analysis, that the representations and
warranties of each party contained in the Merger Agreement are true and correct, that each party will perform all of the covenants and
agreements required to be performed by it under the Merger Agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the Merger will
be satisfied without waiver thereof. Cowen assumed that the final form of the Merger Agreement would be substantially similar to the
last draft reviewed by Cowen. Cowen also assumed that all governmental, regulatory and other consents and approvals contemplated
by the Merger Agreement would be obtained and that in the course of obtaining any of those consents no restrictions would be imposed
or waivers made that would have an adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the Merger. Cowen assumed that the Merger will be
consummated in a manner that complies with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all other applicable state or federal statutes, rules and regulations.

Cowen’s opinion was intended for the benefit and use of the Board in its consideration of the financial terms of the Merger and
may not be disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose whatsoever except with
Cowen’s prior written approval. However, Cowen’s opinion may be reproduced in full in disclosure documents relating to the Merger
which the Company is required to file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including this proxy statement.
Cowen’s opinion is not a recommendation to any stockholder of the Company or any other person as to how to vote with respect to the
Merger or to take any other action in connection with the Merger or otherwise. Cowen was not requested to opine as to, and its opinion
does not in any manner address, the Company’s underlying business decision to effect the Merger or the relative merits of the Merger
as compared to other business strategies or transactions that might be

available to the Company. In addition, Cowen was not asked to opine as to, and its opinion does not in any manner address, the fairness
of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or class of such persons, relative
to the compensation to the public stockholders of the Company or whether Parent or Sponsor has sufficient cash, available lines of
credit or other sources of funds to enable it to pay the consideration of $10.25 per share.

Summary of Material Financial Analyses

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Cowen to arrive at its opinion. Some of the
summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, the
tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial
analyses. Considering the data set forth in the tables without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses,
including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial
analyses. Cowen performed certain procedures, including each of the financial analyses described below, and reviewed with the Board
and the management of the Company the assumptions on which such analyses were based and other factors, including the historical
and projected financial results of the Company.

Following Cowen’s presentation to the Board on April 7, 2017, referred to in this section as the “April 7 Presentation,” and after
Cowen’s further review, Cowen determined, and confirmed with the Company’s management, that the Company’s “Non-GAAP EPS”
amounts set forth in the April 7 Presentation did not exclude stock-based compensation expense, referred to in this section as “SBC.”
Using the Company’s “Non-GAAP EPS” amounts that excluded SBC, referred to in this section as the “Non-GAAP EPS Amounts,”
Cowen subsequently re-performed the portions of its Analysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies and Analysis of Selected
Transactions that utilized such Non-GAAP EPS Amounts, in each case, as described below. Such subsequent analyses performed by
Cowen were performed as of April 7, 2017 and did not address any circumstances, developments or events occurring after April 7,
2017, which is the date of the written opinion of Cowen, and Cowen’s opinion set forth in its written opinion letter was provided only
as of such date. On May 31, 2017, Cowen presented to the Board such subsequent analyses and the differences between such analyses
and the analyses set forth in the April 7 Presentation that resulted from the exclusion of SBC. Based upon and subject to the foregoing,
Cowen confirmed to the Board that, had Cowen performed its financial analyses set forth in the April 7 Presentation using the
Non-GAAP EPS Amounts, there would have been no change to the conclusion set forth in the written opinion of Cowen.

Cowen also noted that the aggregate consideration to be received by the holders of shares of common stock in the Merger based
upon the consideration of $10.25 per share implied a premium of 20.0% to the Company’s Implied Enterprise Value (as defined below)
on April 6, 2017.

For informational purposes only, Cowen also reviewed five recently published, publicly available research analyst reports. These
research analyst reports set a mean 12-month undiscounted price target for the Company of $10.88 per share of common stock, with a
high of $12.00 per share and a low of $10.00 per share of common stock.

Analysis of Selected Publicly Traded Companies

To provide contextual data and comparative market information, Cowen compared selected operating and financial data and
multiples for the Company to the corresponding data and multiples of certain other companies in the semiconductor capital equipment
industry (referred to in this section as the “Selected Companies”) whose securities are publicly traded and that Cowen believes in the
exercise of its professional judgment to have one or more business or operating characteristics, market valuations and trading
valuations similar to what might be expected of the Company. These companies were:

Table of Contents

 •  FormFactor, Inc.
 

 •  inTEST Corporation
 

 •  Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc.
 

 •  Teradyne, Inc.

The data and multiples reviewed by Cowen included:
 

 

•  the market capitalization of equity plus debt and debt-like instruments less cash (“Implied Enterprise Value”) of each of the
Selected Companies, as a multiple of revenue and as a multiple of earnings before interest expense, income taxes,
depreciation and amortization and excluding SBC and non-recurring items (referred to in this section as “Adjusted
EBITDA”), and

 

 
•  the price per share, as of April 6, 2017, of each of the Selected Companies as a multiple of earnings per share excluding

SBC, amortization and non-recurring items (“Non-GAAP EPS”),

in each case, calculated on a pro forma basis to exclude recent divestitures and/or acquisitions, on a historical basis for calendar year
2016 (“CY2016A”) and calendar year 2017 (“CY2017E”) from Capital IQ and Bloomberg where available, or otherwise from research
analyst reports.

The following table presents the multiple of Implied Enterprise Value to revenue and Adjusted EBITDA and the multiple of price
per share, as of April 6, 2017, to Non-GAAP EPS, in each case, for the Selected Companies and for calendar years 2016 and 2017. The
information in the table is based on the closing stock prices of the Selected Companies per Capital IQ on April 6, 2017.

Based upon the information presented above, Cowen’s experience in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and its
professional judgment, Cowen selected implied reference multiple ranges. The following table presents the implied value per share
based on the selected multiple ranges and using the Company’s historical revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP EPS for
calendar year 2016 (“CY2016A”) and the Company’s forecasted revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP EPS for calendar year
2017 (“CY2017E”), as estimated using the Non-GAAP EPS Amounts and also Non-GAAP EPS including SBC as presented in the
April 7 Presentation, in each case compared to the consideration of $10.25 per share.

Although the Selected Companies were used for comparison purposes, none of those companies is directly comparable to the
Company. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of such a comparison is not purely mathematical, but instead involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in historical and projected financial and operating characteristics of the Selected
Companies and other factors that could affect the public trading value of the Selected Companies and the Company to which they are
being compared.

Analysis of Selected Transactions

Cowen reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available based on company filings, press releases and research analyst
reports, of 11 transactions (referred to in this section as the “Selected Transactions”) involving the acquisition of companies or
businesses in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and that Cowen believes in the exercise of its professional judgment to
have one or more business or operating characteristics, market valuations and trading valuations that Cowen deemed relevant, and that

Based upon the information presented above, Cowen’s experience in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and its
professional judgment, Cowen selected implied reference multiple ranges. The following table presents the implied value per share
based on the selected multiple ranges using the Company’s historical LTM revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP EPS (LTM
period ending January 31, 2017) and the Company’s forecasted NTM revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP EPS (NTM period
ending January 31, 2018), as estimated using the Non-GAAP EPS Amounts and also Non-GAAP EPS including SBC as presented in
the April 7 Presentation, in each case compared to the consideration of $10.25 per share.

Although the Selected Transactions were used for comparison purposes, none of those transactions is directly comparable to the
Merger, and none of the target companies in those transactions is directly comparable to the Company. Accordingly, an analysis of the
results of such a comparison is not purely mathematical, but instead involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in historical and projected financial and operating characteristics of the target companies involved and other factors that
could affect the acquisition value of such companies or the Company to which they are being compared.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Cowen estimated a range of values for the shares of common stock based upon the discounted present value of the Company’s
projected unlevered free cash flow for the six-month period ending on July 31, 2017 and the full fiscal years ending in 2018 through
2021 and the terminal value of the Company based on multiples of the Company’s forecasted Adjusted EBITDA for the Company’s
fiscal year ending in 2022, and assuming a Merger closing date of January 31, 2017. This analysis was based upon certain assumptions
described by, projections supplied by and discussions held with the management of the Company. In performing this analysis, Cowen
utilized discount rates ranging from 14.0% to 16.0%, which were selected based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital of
the Company. Cowen utilized terminal multiples of Adjusted EBITDA ranging from 5.5x to 7.5x, which range was selected by Cowen
in its professional judgment and based on the multiples for the Selected Companies. In performing this analysis, Cowen also calculated
the present value of the Company’s estimated United States federal and 16 state net operating loss carry forwards, as provided by
Company management, discounted to present value at a discount rate of 15.3%, which was selected based on the Company’s estimated
cost of equity.

Utilizing this methodology, the implied value per share ranged from $8.85 to $11.04, compared to the consideration of $10.25 per
share.

The summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of all the analyses performed by Cowen. The
preparation of a fairness opinion involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis
and the application of these methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, such an opinion is not readily susceptible to partial
analysis or summary description. Cowen did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis or factor considered by it, but rather
made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor. Accordingly, notwithstanding the separate
factors summarized above, Cowen believes, and has advised the Board, that its analyses must be considered as a whole and that
selecting portions of its analyses and the factors considered by it, without considering all analyses and factors, could create an
incomplete view of the process underlying its opinion. In performing its analyses, Cowen made numerous assumptions with respect to
industry performance, business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company.
These analyses performed by Cowen are not necessarily indicative of actual values or future results, which may be significantly more
or less favorable than suggested by such analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses do not purport to be
appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities may actually be sold. Accordingly, such analyses and estimates are
inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their respective
advisors. None of the Company, Cowen or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those
projected. The analyses supplied by Cowen and its opinion were among several factors taken into consideration by the Board in
making its decision to enter into the Merger Agreement and should not be considered as determinative of such decision.

Table of Contents

Cowen was selected by the Company to render an opinion to the Board because Cowen is a nationally recognized investment
banking firm and because, as part of its investment banking business, Cowen is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and
their securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted
securities, private placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In addition, in the ordinary course of its business,
Cowen and its affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities of the Company for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers, and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. In the two years preceding the date of its
opinion, Cowen has not had a material relationship with, or received any compensation from, the Company, Parent, Sponsor or any
other party to the Merger Agreement. Cowen and its affiliates may in the future provide commercial and investment banking services
to the Company, Parent or Sponsor and may receive fees for the rendering of such services. The issuance of Cowen’s opinion was
approved by Cowen’s Fairness Opinion Review Committee.

Pursuant to the engagement letter between Cowen and the Company, Cowen has received retainer fees and will be entitled to
receive a transaction fee of approximately $5.8 million, $500,000 of which became payable upon Cowen rendering its opinion and the
balance of which is contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. Additionally, the Company has agreed to reimburse Cowen for
certain of its out-of-pocket expenses, including attorneys’ fees (against which expenses, other than attorneys’ fees, the retainer fees
received by Cowen will be credited), and has agreed to indemnify Cowen against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
federal securities laws. The terms of the fee arrangement with Cowen were negotiated at arm’s length between the Company and
Cowen, and the Board was aware of the arrangement, including the fact that a significant portion of the fee payable to Cowen is
contingent upon the consummation of the Merger.

Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you
should be aware that our directors and executive officers have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the
interests of stockholders generally, as more fully described below. The Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent
that they existed at the time, among other matters, in approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger and recommending that the
Merger Agreement be adopted by stockholders.

Arrangements with Parent

As of the date of this proxy statement none of our executive officers has entered into any agreement with Parent or any of its
affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation or one or more
of its affiliates. Prior to or following the closing of the Merger, certain of our executive officers may have discussions, or may enter
into agreements with, Parent or Merger Sub or their respective affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or
participate in the equity of, the Surviving Corporation or one or more of its affiliates.

Change of Control Agreements

Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger are each party to a Change-of-Control Employment Agreement with the Company (a
“Change-of-Control Employment Agreement”). Each Change-of-Control Employment Agreement provides for certain separation
benefits in the event that the applicable executive’s employment is terminated by the Company (or a successor entity) other than for
“cause,” death, or “disability” or by the executive for “good reason,” (as such terms are defined in the Change-of-Control Employment
Agreement) during the three years following the closing date of the Merger, or for any reason during the 30-day period following the
first anniversary of the closing date of the Merger (or upon certain terminations prior to the Merger or in connection with or in
anticipation of the Merger), as described in further in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger
Agreement — Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control.”

Executive Employment Agreement

Mr. Rondé is party to an employment agreement with our French subsidiary. Mr. Rondé’s employment agreement provides for
separation benefits in the event that his employment is terminated by us, except in the case of his gross or willful misconduct, subject
to Mr. Rondé executing and not revoking a Company provided settlement agreement, as described in further in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement — Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control.”

Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers

The Merger Agreement provides that the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries under (i) any
and all indemnification agreements between the Company or any of its subsidiaries, any of their respective current or former directors
and officers as of the date of the Merger Agreement pursuant to the terms of such agreements as in effect as of the date of the Merger
Agreement and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and
executes an indemnification agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company and no more favorable to such person than the
current form of indemnification agreement with its directors that has been made available to Parent and (ii) any and all indemnification,
expense advancement and exculpation provisions in any articles of organization or bylaws or comparable organizational document of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, in each case until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time.

The Merger Agreement also provides that, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to) cause the articles of organization, bylaws or
other organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation, advancement of expenses and limitation of director and officer liability that are at least as favorable to the current or
former directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries as those set forth in the Company’s and its subsidiaries’
organizational documents as of the date of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement further provides that the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries will not, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, amend, repeal or otherwise modify such
provisions in the organizational documents in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the current or former directors and
officers of the Company and its subsidiaries.

The Merger Agreement also provides that, prior to the Effective Time, the Company will purchase a six year prepaid “tail” policy
on the Company’s current officers and directors liability insurance, provided that the Company will not pay, and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay, annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for such
coverage for its last full fiscal year. The Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such
“tail” policy in full force and effect. The “tail” policy will cover claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement.

Treatment of Restricted Stock Units

Each Vested RSU will be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time and the holder thereof will receive an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to the Restricted Stock Unit Consideration. The Company will pay each holder of a Vested RSU the Restricted
Stock Unit Consideration on either (i) the first regulatory scheduled payroll date after the closing of the Merger or (ii) if such payroll
date is scheduled for payment prior to the fifth business day after the closing of the Merger, the second regularly scheduled payroll date
after the closing of the Merger.

Each Unvested RSU will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the Unvested RSU
Consideration. The Unvested RSU Consideration will be subject to the same vesting terms

and conditions applicable to the Unvested RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the same vesting restrictions and
continued service requirements, and payment of the Unvested RSU Consideration will be made on the vesting dates applicable to the
Unvested RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, the performance-based vesting of each Performance-Based RSU will be
accelerated in full with all performance conditions being deemed achieved at 100% and each such Performance-Based RSU will be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the Performance-Based RSU Consideration The
Performance-Based RSU Consideration will be subject to the same time-based vesting terms and conditions applicable to the
Performance-Based RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and will be paid on the time-based vesting dates applicable to such
Performance-Based RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time.

For a more complete description of the treatment of Company RSUs, see the sections of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger Agreement — Treatment of Equity-Based Awards.”

2010 Stock Plan

Our 2010 Stock Plan provides that all unvested RSUs will become vested in full if the participant is terminated without “cause”
(as defined in the 2010 Stock Plan) by the Company or an acquiring or succeeding corporation within one year after a “change in
control event” (as defined in the 2010 Stock Plan and which includes the Merger). In summary, “cause” is defined in the 2010 Stock
Plan as (i) willful failure by the participant, which failure is not cured within 30 days of written notice to the participant from the
Company, to perform his or her material responsibilities to the Company or (ii) willful misconduct by the participant which affects the
business reputation of the Company, with the participant being considered to have been discharged for “cause” if the Company
determines, within 30 days after the participant’s resignation, that discharge for cause was warranted.

Treatment of Purchase Rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company will not establish any new offering period under the Company ESPP and the
Company will take all actions necessary so that (i) any offering period and purchase period (or similar period during which shares may
be purchased) underway as of the date of the Merger Agreement under the Company ESPP is terminated as of the Final Exercise Date;
(ii) any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect any shortened offering period or purchase period (or similar period) are
made and so that any such shortened offering period or purchase period (or similar period) is treated as a fully effective and completed
offering period or purchase period, as applicable, for all purposes under the Company ESPP; (iii) each participant’s shares purchase
right under the Company ESPP outstanding as of the Final Exercise Date are exercised as of the Final Exercise Date; (iv) no further
offering periods or purchase periods (or similar periods during which shares may be purchased) will commence under the Company
ESPP on or after the date of the Merger Agreement; (v) no participant in the Company ESPP may increase the rate of his or her
contributions to the Company ESPP on or after the date of the Merger Agreement; (vi) no individual who is not participating in the
Company ESPP as of the date of the Merger Agreement may commence participation in the Company ESPP on or after the date of the
Merger Agreement; and (vii) the Company ESPP is terminated as of the Final Exercise Date, provided, however, that termination of the
Company ESPP will be subject to the consummation of the Merger.

compensation that is required to be disclosed and subject to the advisory vote pursuant to SEC rules. Pursuant to the SEC rules, the
disclosure provided below includes compensation to the named executive officers, whether present, deferred or contingent, that is
based on or otherwise relates to the Merger.

The amounts set forth in the table below, which represent an estimate of each named executive officer’s transaction-related
compensation, as of August 30, 2017, assume the following:
 

 •  a closing date of the Merger of August 30, 2017;
 

 

•  Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger are terminated by the Company other than for “cause” (within the meaning of their
Change-of-Control Employment Agreements and the 2010 Stock Plan), death or “disability” or by the executive for “good
reason” (within the meaning of their Change-of-Control Employment Agreements), or for any reason during the 30-day
period following the first anniversary of the assumed date of the completion of the Merger (August 30, 2017) (or upon
certain terminations prior to the Merger or in connection with or in anticipation of the Merger), and Mr. Rondé is terminated
by the Company for any reason, except in the case of gross or willful misconduct or without “cause” (as defined in the 2010
Stock Plan), in each case, immediately following the Merger, entitling the named executive officer to receive the severance
payments and benefits under the terms of such named executive officer’s Change-of-Control Employment Agreement, for
Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger, and employment agreement, for Mr. Rondé, and each of the named executive officers to
receive the acceleration of his Unvested RSUs and Performance-Based RSUs pursuant to the terms of the 2010 Stock Plan;
and

 

 
•  the value of acceleration of vesting of Unvested RSUs and Performance-Based RSUs held by each named executive officer

as of August 30, 2017, equals the Unvested RSU Consideration and Performance-Based RSU Consideration, respectively,
payable to such named executive officer.

Please note that the amounts reported below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including
the assumptions described above and those described in “The Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger”” beginning on page 70. As a result, the actual merger-related compensation, if any, to be received by a named executive
officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set forth below.

Merger Agreement, each Unvested RSU will be converted into the right to receive the Unvested RSU Consideration and each
Performance-Based RSU will be converted into the right to receive the Performance-Based RSU Consideration, each subject to
the same time-based vesting terms and conditions of such awards immediately prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement, as
described in further detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement — Treatment of Equity-Based

reimbursement. These gross up payments are “single-trigger” in nature as they will become payable immediately upon the
completion of the Merger, whether or not employment is terminated. No gross up amounts would have been payable if a
qualifying termination occurred on the assumed date of the completion of the Merger (August 30, 2017). The employment
agreement with Mr. Rondé does not provide for a gross up to cover any taxes payable by Mr. Rondé.

Financing of the Merger

The Merger is not conditioned on Parent obtaining the proceeds of any financing. We anticipate that the total funds necessary to
complete the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will be approximately $580 million. These
funds include the funds needed to:
 

 •  pay the Company’s stockholders the amounts due under the Merger Agreement; and
 

 •  make payments in respect of certain of the Company’s outstanding equity-based awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

In connection with the Merger, (A) Sponsor has delivered the Equity Commitment Letter to Parent, pursuant to which Sponsor
has committed to subscribe for equity securities of Parent with an aggregate purchase price of RMB1.5 billion (equivalent to
approximately $227.4 million based on the prevailing exchange rate as of August 30, 2017) and (B) Lender has delivered the Debt
Commitment Letter to Parent, pursuant to which Lender has committed to loan to Parent the lesser of (1) RMB2.76 billion (equivalent
to approximately $418.5 million based on the prevailing exchange rate as of August 30, 2017) and (2) the difference of (x) the RMB
equivalent of the aggregate payment obligations of Parent under the Merger Agreement less (y) RMB1.5 billion (equivalent to

approximately $227.4 million based on the prevailing exchange rate as of August 30, 2017), in each case of (A) and (B), for the
purpose of funding the Per Share Merger Consideration payable by Parent under the Merger Agreement and related costs and expenses.

Each of Sponsor’s and Lender’s obligations under the Equity Commitment Letter or Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable, are
conditioned upon (a) the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by the Company and (b) the satisfaction or waiver of
Parent’s and the Company’s mutual conditions to closing and of Parent’s and Merger Sub’s conditions to closing (other than any
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger, but subject to their satisfaction or waiver at the closing of
the Merger). Pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters, Parent has agreed that no party other than Sponsor or Lender, as
applicable, will have any obligation to, or liability for the failure to, provide the equity or debt financing, regardless of the party’s
relation to Sponsor or Lender, respectively.

Each Commitment Letter also provides that, subject to receipt of the Company’s prior written consent, Parent will have the right
to permit Sponsor or Lender to assign its respective commitment under the Equity Commitment Letter or Debt Commitment Letter, as
applicable, to other financing sources; provided that the Company’s consent is not required for such an assignment if such assignment
would not: (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the financing provided under the respective Commitment Letter to an amount that is
below the amount required, together with other financial resources of Parent and Merger Sub, including cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger on the terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement;
(ii) adversely impact the ability of Parent and/or Merger Sub to enforce their rights under the applicable Commitment Letter;
(iii) amend or modify the then-existing conditions precedent to funding of the financing provided under the respective Commitment
Letter in a manner that would make such conditions materially less likely to be satisfied by the closing of the Merger or impose new or
additional conditions precedent to funding of the financing provided thereunder; or (iv) otherwise be reasonably expected to prevent or
materially delay or impair the ability of Parent to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

Each Commitment Letter also includes an acknowledgement and agreement by Parent and Sponsor or Lender, as applicable, that
the Company is an express third party beneficiary of the Commitment Letter and is entitled to enforce the obligations of Sponsor or
Lender, as applicable, to the full extent provided in the respective Commitment Letter and to seek and obtain specific performance to
cause Parent to cause, or to directly cause, Sponsor or Lender, as applicable, to fund the commitment by it in its respective
Commitment Letter.

Closing and Effective Time

The closing of the Merger will take place no later than the second business day following the satisfaction or waiver in accordance
with the Merger Agreement of all of the conditions to closing of the Merger (as described under the caption “The Merger
Agreement — Conditions to the Closing of the Merger”), other than conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions.

Appraisal Rights

Under the provisions of Part 13 of the MBCA, a stockholder of a Massachusetts corporation is entitled to appraisal rights, and
payment of the fair value of his, her or its shares, in the event of certain corporate actions. Appraisal rights offer stockholders the
ability to demand payment in cash of the fair value of their shares in the event they are dissatisfied with the consideration that they are
to receive in connection with the corporate action. Under Section 13.02(a)(1) of the MBCA, stockholders of a Massachusetts
corporation generally are entitled to appraisal rights in the event of a merger, but such rights are subject to certain exceptions. Under
the MBCA, the Company is required to state whether it has concluded that Xcerra stockholders are, are not or may be entitled to assert
appraisal rights. The Company has concluded that Xcerra stockholders may be entitled to appraisal rights.

Table of Contents

Any stockholder who believes that he, she or it is entitled to appraisal rights and who wishes to preserve those rights should
carefully review Part 13 of the MBCA, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C, which sets forth the
procedures to be complied with in perfecting any such rights. Failure to strictly comply with the procedures specified in Part 13 of the
MBCA could result in the loss of any appraisal rights to which stockholders may be entitled. To the extent any stockholder seeks to
assert appraisal rights but is determined by a court not to be entitled to such appraisal rights (or was entitled to exercise such appraisal
rights but failed to take all necessary action to perfect them or effectively withdraws or loses them), such stockholder will be entitled to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest.

Under the MBCA, stockholders who perfect their rights to appraisal in accordance with Part 13 of the MBCA and do not
thereafter withdraw their demands for appraisal or otherwise lose their appraisal rights, in each case in accordance with the MBCA,
will be entitled to demand payment of the “fair value” of their shares of Xcerra common stock, together with interest, each as
determined under Part 13 of the MBCA. The fair value of the shares is the value of the shares immediately before the Effective Time of
the Merger, excluding any element of value arising from the expectation or accomplishment of the Merger, unless exclusion would be
inequitable. Stockholders should be aware that the fair value of their shares of Xcerra common stock as determined by Part 13 of the
MBCA could be more than, the same as or less than the Per Share Merger Consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if
they did not seek appraisal of their shares.

Stockholders who wish to exercise appraisal rights or to preserve their right to do so should review the following discussion and
Part 13 of the MBCA carefully. Stockholders who fail to timely and properly comply with the procedures specified could lose their
appraisal rights. If a broker, bank or other nominee holds your shares of Xcerra common stock and you wish to assert appraisal rights,
you must instruct your nominee to take the steps necessary to enable you to assert appraisal rights. If you or your nominee fails to
follow all of the steps required by the MBCA, you could lose any right to demand appraisal of your shares. You should note that a
vote in favor of the Merger Agreement will result in the waiver of any right that you would otherwise have to demand payment
for your shares under the appraisal rights provisions of the MBCA.

A stockholder who wishes to assert appraisal rights must deliver written notice of such stockholder’s intent to demand payment to
Xcerra’s principal offices at the following address: Xcerra Corporation, 825 University Avenue, Norwood, Massachusetts 02062,
Attention: Corporate Secretary. If Xcerra does not receive a stockholder’s written notice of intent to demand payment prior to the vote
at the Special Meeting, or if such stockholder votes, or causes or permits to be voted, his, her or its shares of Xcerra common stock in
favor of approval of the Merger Agreement, such stockholder will not be entitled to any appraisal rights under the provisions of the
MBCA and will instead only be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration. The submission of a proxy card voting
“against” or “abstaining” on the Merger Agreement proposal will not constitute sufficient notice of a stockholder’s intent to demand
payment to satisfy Part 13 of the MBCA.

Only a holder of record of shares of Xcerra common stock may exercise appraisal rights. Except as described below, a
stockholder may assert appraisal rights only if such stockholder seeks such rights with respect to all of his, her or its shares. A record
stockholder may assert appraisal rights as to fewer than all the shares registered in his, her or its name but owned by a beneficial
stockholder only if the record stockholder objects with respect to all shares of the class or series owned by the beneficial stockholder
and notifies Xcerra in writing of the name and address of each beneficial stockholder on whose behalf appraisal rights are being
asserted. The rights of a record stockholder who asserts appraisal rights for only part of the shares held of record in the record
stockholder’s name will be determined as if the shares as to which the record stockholder objects and the record stockholder’s other
shares were registered in the names of different record stockholders.

If the Merger is completed, Part 13 of the MBCA requires Xcerra to deliver a written appraisal notice to all stockholders who
satisfied the requirements described above. The appraisal notice must be sent by Xcerra no earlier than the date the Merger becomes
effective and no later than 10 days after such date. The appraisal notice must include a copy of Part 13 of the MBCA and a certification
form that specifies the date of the first

announcement to Xcerra stockholders of the principal terms of the Merger and requires the stockholder asserting appraisal rights to
certify (1) whether or not beneficial ownership of the shares for which appraisal rights are asserted was acquired before the
announcement date and (2) that the stockholder did not vote in favor of the Merger Agreement. The appraisal notice also must state:
 

 
•  the date by which Xcerra must receive the certification form, which may not be fewer than 40 nor more than 60 days after

the date the appraisal notice and certification form are sent to stockholders demanding appraisal, and that the stockholder
waives the right to demand appraisal with respect to the shares unless Xcerra receives the certification form by such date;

 

 
•  where the certification form must be sent and where certificates for certificated shares must be deposited and the date by

which the certificates must be deposited;
 

 •  Xcerra’s estimate of the fair value of the shares;
 

 
•  that, if requested by the stockholder in writing, Xcerra will provide the number of stockholders who return certification

forms by the due date and the total number of shares owned by them; and
 

 •  the date by which the notice to withdraw a demand for appraisal must be received.

Once a stockholder deposits his, her or its certificates or, in the case of uncertificated shares, returns the executed certification
form, the stockholder loses all rights as a stockholder unless the stockholder withdraws from the appraisal process by notifying Xcerra
in writing by the withdrawal deadline. A stockholder who does not withdraw from the appraisal process in this manner may not later
withdraw without Xcerra’s written consent. A stockholder who does not execute and return the form (and in the case of certificated
shares, deposit such stockholder’s share certificates) by the due date will not be entitled to payment under Part 13 of the MBCA.

Part 13 of the MBCA provides for certain differences in the rights of stockholders exercising appraisal rights depending on
whether their shares are acquired before or after the announcement of a merger. Except with respect to shares acquired after the
announcement date of April 10, 2017, Xcerra must pay in cash to those stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights and have
complied with the procedural requirements of Part 13 of the MBCA, the amount that Xcerra estimates to be the fair value of their
shares, plus interest. Interest accrues from the Effective Time of the merger until the date of payment, at the average rate currently paid
by Xcerra on its principal bank loans or, if none, at a rate that is fair and equitable under all the circumstances. This payment must be
made by Xcerra within 30 days after the due date of the certification form, and must be accompanied by:
 

 •  recent financial statements of Xcerra;
 

 
•  a statement of Xcerra’s estimate of the fair value of the shares, which estimate must equal or exceed Xcerra’s estimate given

in the appraisal notice; and
 

 
•  a statement that stockholders who complied with the procedural requirements have the right, if dissatisfied with such

payment, to demand further payment as described below.

A stockholder who has been paid Xcerra’s estimated fair value and is dissatisfied with the amount of the payment must notify
Xcerra in writing of his, her or its estimate of the fair value of the shares and demand payment of that estimate plus interest, less the
payment already made. A stockholder who fails to notify Xcerra in writing of his, her or its demand to be paid such stockholder’s
stated estimate of the fair value plus interest within 30 days after receiving Xcerra’s payment waives the right to demand further
payment and will be entitled only to the payment made by Xcerra based on Xcerra’s estimate of the fair value of the shares.

Xcerra may withhold payment from stockholders who are entitled to appraisal rights but did not certify that beneficial ownership
of all of such stockholder’s shares for which appraisal rights are asserted was acquired before the announcement date. If Xcerra elects
to withhold payment, it must provide such stockholders notice of certain information within 30 days after the due date of the
certification form, including Xcerra’s estimate of fair value and the stockholder’s right to accept Xcerra’s estimate of fair value, plus
interest, in full satisfaction of the

stockholder’s demand. Those stockholders who wish to accept the offer must notify Xcerra of their acceptance within 30 days after
receiving the offer. Within 10 days after receiving a stockholder’s acceptance, Xcerra must pay in cash the amount it offered in full
satisfaction of the accepting stockholder’s demand.

A stockholder offered payment who is dissatisfied with that offer must reject the offer and demand payment of his, her or its
stated estimate of the fair value of such stockholder’s shares, plus interest. A stockholder who fails to notify Xcerra in writing of his,
her or its demand to be paid his, her or its stated estimate of the fair value plus interest within 30 days after receiving Xcerra’s offer of
payment waives the right to demand payment and will be entitled only to the payment offered by Xcerra based on Xcerra’s estimate of
the fair value of the shares. Those stockholders who do not reject Xcerra’s offer in a timely manner will be deemed to have accepted
Xcerra’s offer, and Xcerra must pay to them in cash the amount it offered to pay within 40 days after sending the offer.

If a stockholder makes a demand for payment which remains unsettled, Xcerra must commence an equitable proceeding in
Norfolk Superior Court, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, within 60 days after receiving the payment demand and petition the court to
determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest. If Xcerra does not commence the proceeding within the 60-day period, it
must pay in cash to each stockholder the amount such stockholder demanded, plus interest. Xcerra must make all stockholders whose
demands remain unsettled parties to the proceeding as an action against their shares, and all parties must be served with a copy of the
petition. Each stockholder made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment (1) for the amount, if any, by which the court finds the
fair value of the stockholder’s shares, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by Xcerra to the stockholder for such shares or (2) the fair
value, plus interest, of the stockholder’s shares for which Xcerra elected to withhold payment.

The court in an appraisal proceeding must determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and
expenses of appraisers appointed by the court. The court must assess any costs against Xcerra, except that the court may assess costs
against all or some of the stockholders demanding appraisal, in amounts the court finds equitable, to the extent the court finds such
stockholders acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by Part 13 of the MBCA. The court in
an appraisal proceeding may also assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties, in amounts the court
finds equitable:
 

 
•  against Xcerra and in favor of any or all stockholders demanding appraisal if the court finds Xcerra did not substantially

comply with its requirements under Part 13 of the MBCA; or
 

 
•  against either Xcerra or a stockholder demanding appraisal, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party

against whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights
provided by Part 13 of the MBCA.

If the court in an appraisal proceeding finds that the services of counsel for any stockholder were of substantial benefit to other
stockholders similarly situated, and that the fees for those services should not be assessed against Xcerra, the court may award to such
counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded the stockholders who were benefited. To the extent Xcerra fails to make
a required payment pursuant to Part 13 of the MBCA, the stockholder may sue directly for the amount owed and, to the extent
successful, will be entitled to recover from Xcerra all costs and expenses of the suit, including counsel fees.

The foregoing discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the MBCA and is qualified
in its entirety by the full text of Part 13 of the MBCA, which is attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C.
Stockholders should consult with their advisors, including legal counsel, in connection with any demand for appraisal.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders and
Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of our common stock whose shares are converted

into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. The
effects of other U.S. federal tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws are not
discussed. This discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (the “IRS”), in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations.
Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a U.S. Holder or
Non-U.S. Holder. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be
no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position to that discussed below regarding tax consequences of the Merger.

This discussion is limited to holders who hold our common stock as a “capital asset” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a
holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income. In addition, it does
not address consequences relevant to holders subject to special rules, including, without limitation:
 

 •  tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations;
 

 •  persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;
 

 
•  S-corporations, partnerships or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S.

federal income tax purposes (and investors therein);
 

 •  banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions;
 

 •  brokers, dealers or traders in securities;
 

 •  regulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts;
 

 •  U.S. expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;
 

 
•  persons holding our common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction transaction or as part of a conversion

transaction or other integrated investment;
 

 •  persons deemed to sell our common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code;
 

 
•  persons who received our common stock in a compensatory transaction or pursuant to the exercise of options or warrants or

pursuant to restricted stock units;
 

 •  persons who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in Parent or the Surviving Corporation following the Merger;
 

 •  U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;
 

 
•  “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies” or corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid

U.S. federal income tax;
 

 •  tax-qualified retirement plans; and
 

 
•  persons who do not vote in favor of the Merger and who properly demand appraisal of their shares under Part 13 of the

MBCA.

If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) is a beneficial owner of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the
status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Partnerships holding our
common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger.

This discussion does not address the tax consequences pertaining to Company RSUs that are converted into the right to receive
cash in connection with the Merger.

THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE. HOLDERS
SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY
CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR
NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION.

U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of our common stock that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, is or is treated as any of the following:
 

 •  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
 

 •  a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
 

 •  an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
 

 
•  a trust (1) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and the control of one or more United

States persons as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code; or (2) that has a valid election in effect to be treated as a
United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for our common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable transaction for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, a U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of
cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax
basis will generally equal the price the U.S. Holder paid for such shares. Such gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss, and will be a
long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the Merger. A
preferential tax rate generally will apply to long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. Holders. The deductibility
of capital losses is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of common stock at different times or different
prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its tax basis, holding period and gain or loss separately with respect to each block of common
stock.

Non-U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of our common stock that is neither a U.S.
Holder nor an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder resulting from the Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:
 

 
•  the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if

required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S.
Holder in the United States);

 

 
•  the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the Merger,

and certain other requirements are met; or
 

 

•  the Company is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of
the Code (“USRPHC”) at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Merger or such Non-U.S.
Holder’s holding period with respect to the applicable shares of common stock and, if our common stock is regularly traded
on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 897(c)(3) of the Code), such Non-U.S. Holder owned,
actually or constructively, more than 5% of the Company’s common stock at any time during such period.

Table of Contents

Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the
regular graduated rates applicable to U.S. persons. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax
at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain, as adjusted for
certain items.

Gain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate
specified by an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by certain U.S. source capital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder (even
though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal
income tax returns with respect to such losses.

With respect to the third bullet point above, we believe we have not been and are not currently a USRPHC, and we do not
anticipate becoming a USRPHC before the Merger.

Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding potentially applicable income tax treaties that may provide for
different rules.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Information reporting and backup withholding may apply to the proceeds received by a holder pursuant to the Merger. Backup
withholding generally will not apply to (1) a U.S. Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and certifies that such
holder is not subject to backup withholding on IRS Form W-9, or otherwise establishes a basis for exemption from backup
withholding, or (2) a Non-U.S. Holder who provides a certification of such holder’s non-U.S. status on the applicable IRS Form W-8,
or otherwise establishes a basis for exemption from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts
withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax
liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS
may be made available under the provisions of an applicable treaty or agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which a
Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

Each of the Company and Parent have agreed to use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties to the Merger Agreement in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to: (i) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act; (ii) obtain
any required consents under any applicable laws of the Foreign Antitrust Jurisdictions; (iii) obtain the approval by the relevant
governmental authorities in the PRC; (iv) obtain the approval by the relevant governmental authorities in Taiwan; (v) obtain the
approval of CFIUS; and (vi) avoid any impediment to the consummation of the Merger under any applicable law (including anti-trust
laws) or orders, including using reasonable best efforts to take all such action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, as the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”),
CFIUS, the relevant governmental authority of Taiwan, the PRC or any other governmental authority or person may assert under
applicable laws or orders with respect to the Merger.

HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters

Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, certain transactions exceeding the applicable thresholds require
notification to the FTC and the DOJ and expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period before the transaction can be
consummated, unless an exemption applies. Parent has determined that notification of the Merger to the FTC and DOJ under the HSR
Act is required because the Merger exceeds the applicable thresholds and no exemption applies.

Table of Contents

The Company and Parent are required under the Merger Agreement to submit a notification and report form to the FTC and DOJ
as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of the Merger Agreement. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be
completed until the expiration of a waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms (typically
a 30-day period) or the early termination of that waiting period.

At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, even in the event of termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary under the applicable statutes, including
seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to
license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of
the Merger, even in the event of termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take such action under the
antitrust laws as it deems necessary. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of
substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and
contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances.

CFIUS

The Merger is also conditioned on the approval or clearance of, or noninterference with, the Merger by CFIUS. Section 721 of the
Defense Production Act, as well as related Executive Orders and regulations, authorize the President or CFIUS to review transactions
which could result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person. Under the Defense Production Act and Executive Order 13456, the
Secretary of the Treasury acts through CFIUS to coordinate review of certain covered transactions that are voluntarily submitted to
CFIUS or that are unilaterally reviewed by CFIUS. In general, CFIUS review of a covered transaction occurs in an initial 30-day
review period that may be extended by CFIUS for an additional 45-day investigation period. At the close of its review or investigation,
CFIUS may determine that there are no national security concerns with the transaction, may impose mitigation terms to resolve any
national security concerns with the covered transaction, or may send a report to the President recommending that the transaction be
suspended or prohibited, or providing notice to the President that CFIUS cannot agree on a recommendation relative to the covered
transaction. The President has 15 days under the Defense Production Act to act on CFIUS’s report.

People’s Republic of China

The Merger is also conditioned on the receipt of regulatory approvals in the PRC. These approvals include (A) the receipt of a
Filing Notice (or any equivalent document as amended/renamed) issued by the NDRC with respect to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (B) receipt of an Enterprise Overseas Direct Investment Certificate (or any
equivalent document as amended/renamed) issued by MOFCOM with respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement; (C) completion of an overseas direct investment registration with SAFE or an authorized PRC bank under
SAFE’s supervision (as applicable), and the receipt of a Business Registration Certificate with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby and other registration, filing or approval required by PRC law.

Taiwan

Parent’s and Merger Sub’s obligation to consummate the Merger conditioned on the receipt of regulatory approvals in Taiwan.
These approvals include filings, approvals or clearances for foreign/PRC investments under the Taiwan Act.

Pursuant to the Taiwan Act, individuals, legal entities, groups and other institutions of the PRC are not permitted to own any
shares or have a controlling interest, directly or indirectly, in Taiwanese businesses which operate in certain forbidden or restricted
industries. At the time of the execution of the Merger Agreement, the

Table of Contents

Company’s Taiwan operations included industries that are included in the forbidden or restricted industries. The Company and Parent
have agreed that the Company will take such steps as are necessary to amend the registered business scope of the Company’s Taiwan
entities and branches to remove therefrom any business items which would prevent the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Taiwan from
approving an application to change the status of the Company’s Taiwan entities or branches from an entity or branch of a foreign
investor to an entity or branch of a PRC investor, effective no later than the consummation of the Merger, and will take any
commercially reasonable further steps to amend the registered business scope of the Taiwan branch as may be requested by such
Taiwan governmental authorities as a condition of the approval of such application.

Other Regulatory Approvals

One or more governmental agencies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants
the necessary approvals and consents to the consummation of the Merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory
process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, any of which actions could significantly impede or even preclude
obtaining required regulatory approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the required
regulatory approvals or whether such approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a substantial period of time between the
approval by stockholders and the completion of the Merger.

Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these
regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and
approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the completion of the Merger, including the requirement to divest
assets, or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions to the
Merger not being satisfied.

Legal Proceedings

On August 22, 2017, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts against the Company and each member of the Board, captioned Chris Stallings v. Xcerra Corporation, et al., C.A. No.
1:17-cv-11579. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the Company and the Board violated federal securities laws and
regulations by soliciting stockholder votes in connection with the Merger through a proxy statement that omits material facts necessary
to make the statements therein not false or misleading. The complaint seeks, among other things, either to enjoin the Company and the
Board from conducting the stockholder vote on the Merger unless and until the allegedly omitted material information is disclosed to
the Company’s stockholders or, in the event the Merger is consummated, to recover damages resulting from the Company’s and the
Board’s violations of federal securities laws and regulations.

On August 23, 2017, a putative shareholder class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts against the Company, each member of the Board, Parent, Unic Capital, Sponsor and Merger Sub, captioned Robert Berg
v. Xcerra Corporation et. al., Case No. 1:17-cv-11583. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the Company, the Board, Parent,
Unic Capital, Sponsor and Merger Sub violated federal securities laws and regulations by soliciting stockholder votes in connection
with the Merger through a proxy statement that omits material information with respect to the proposed Merger, which renders the
proxy statement false and misleading. The complaint seeks, among other things, either to enjoin the Company, the Board, Parent, Unic
Capital, Sponsor and Merger Sub from proceeding with, consummating or closing the Merger or, in the event the Merger is
consummated, to rescind the Merger and set aside or award rescissory damages.

The Company is reviewing the complaints and has not yet formally responded to them, but believes that the plaintiffs’ allegations
are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously. However, litigation is inherently uncertain and there can be no
assurance regarding the likelihood that the Company’s defense of the actions will be successful. Additional complaints containing
substantially similar allegations may be filed in the future.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in
this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger
Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated into this proxy statement by reference.
We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information
about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms
of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement. Capitalized
terms used in this section but not defined in this proxy statement have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described below and included in the Merger Agreement (1) were made
only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (2) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger
Agreement; and (3) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by the Company
and Parent in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be subject
to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and in
some cases were qualified by confidential matters disclosed to Parent and Merger Sub by the Company in connection with the Merger
Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purpose of
allocating contractual risk between the Company, Parent and Merger Sub rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to
standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Stockholders are not third-party
beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements or any
descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may
change after the date of the Merger Agreement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual
limitations on the respective businesses of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, because the parties may take certain actions that are
either expressly permitted in the confidential disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate
party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as
Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide any other factual information
regarding the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective businesses. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and
other agreements in the Merger Agreement should not be read alone, and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this
document and in our filings with the SEC regarding the Company and our business.

Effects of the Merger; Directors and Officers; Articles of Organization; Bylaws

The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and in accordance with the
MCBA, at the Effective Time, (1) Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company becoming a controlled
subsidiary of Parent; and (2) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease. From and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, and all
of the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

The parties will take all necessary action to ensure that, effective as of, and immediately following, the Effective Time, the board
of directors of the Surviving Corporation will consist of the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time, to hold office in accordance
with the articles of organization and bylaws of the Surviving

Corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until their successors are duly
appointed. At the Effective Time, the articles of organization of the Company as the Surviving Corporation will be amended to read
substantially identically to the articles of organization of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the
bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will become the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter amended.

Closing and Effective Time

The closing of the Merger will take place no later than the second business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all
conditions to closing of the Merger (described below under the caption “The Merger Agreement —Conditions to the Closing of the
Merger”) (other than those conditions to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger, but subject to satisfaction or waiver, if permitted, of
those conditions) or such other time agreed to in writing by Parent, the Company and Merger Sub.

Merger Consideration

Common Stock

At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of common stock (other than Excluded Shares) will be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (which is $10.25 per share, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes). All
shares converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration will automatically be cancelled at the Effective Time.

Treatment of Equity-Based Awards

Treatment of Restricted Stock Units

As of August 30, 2017, there were 2,455,276 Company RSUs, of which 1,170,250 were held by our directors and executive
officers.

Each Vested RSU will be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time and the holder thereof will receive an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to the Restricted Stock Unit Consideration. The Company will pay each holder of a Vested RSU the Restricted
Stock Unit Consideration on either (i) the first regulatory scheduled payroll date after the closing of the Merger or (ii) if such payroll
date is scheduled for payment prior to the fifth business day after the closing of the Merger, the second regularly scheduled payroll date
after the closing of the Merger.

Each Unvested RSU will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the Unvested RSU
Consideration. The Unvested RSU Consideration will be subject to the same vesting terms and conditions applicable to the Unvested
RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the same vesting restrictions and continued service requirements, and payment
of the Unvested RSU Consideration will be made on the vesting dates applicable to the Unvested RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, the performance-based vesting of each Performance-Based RSU will be
accelerated in full with all performance conditions being deemed achieved at 100% and each such Performance-Based RSU will be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the Performance-Based RSU Consideration. The
Performance-Based RSU Consideration will be subject to the same time-based vesting terms and conditions applicable to the
Performance-Based RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and will be paid on the same time-based vesting dates applicable to
such Performance-Based RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Treatment of Purchase Rights under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company will not establish any new offering period under the Company ESPP and the
Company will take all action necessary so that (i) any offering period and purchase period (or similar period during which shares may
be purchased) underway as of the date of the Merger Agreement under the Company ESPP is terminated as of the Final Exercise Date;
(ii) any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect any shortened offering period or purchase period (or similar period) are
made and so that any such shortened offering period or purchase period (or similar period) is treated as a fully effective and completed
offering period or purchase period, as applicable, for all purposes under the Company ESPP; (iii) each participant’s shares purchase
right under the Company ESPP outstanding as of the Final Exercise Date are exercised as of the Final Exercise Date; (iv) no further
offering periods or purchase periods (or similar periods during which shares may be purchased) will commence under the Company
ESPP on or after the date of the Merger Agreement; (v) no participant in the Company ESPP may increase the rate of his or her
contributions to the Company ESPP on or after the date of the Merger Agreement; (vi) no individual who is not participating in the
Company ESPP as of the date of the Merger Agreement may commence participation in the Company ESPP on or after the date of the
Merger Agreement; and (vii) the Company ESPP is terminated as of the Final Exercise Date, provided, however, that termination of the
Company ESPP will be subject to the consummation of the Merger.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control

Change-of-Control Employment Agreements

Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger are, individually, party to a Change-of-Control Employment Agreement with the Company,
originally entered into in 1998 and 2000, respectively. Each agreement has a three-year term that extends for one year upon the
anniversary date of the agreement unless a notice not to extend is given by us. Under each of the Change-of-Control Employment
Agreements, if a “change of control” (as defined in the agreement and which includes the Merger) of the Company occurs during the
term of an agreement, then the agreement becomes operative for a fixed three-year period. Each agreement provides generally that the
applicable executive’s terms and conditions of employment (including position, location, compensation and benefits) will not be
adversely changed during the three-year period after a change of control of the Company. If we terminate the executive’s employment
other than for “cause,” death or “disability” or if the executive terminates for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in the
agreement) during such three-year period or for any reason during the 30-day period following the first anniversary of the change of
control (or upon certain terminations prior to a change of control or in connection with or in anticipation of a change of control), the
executive is entitled to receive the following severance compensation:
 

 

•  a lump sum cash payment paid within 30 days of termination equal to the sum of (a) our accrued obligations through the date
of termination for base pay and prorated bonus based upon the higher of (i) the annual variable incentive compensation paid
for the most recently completed fiscal year after the change of control or (ii) the average of the annual variable incentive
compensation paid for the two of the last three full fiscal years prior to the change of control in which such amounts were the
highest (the “Highest Annual Bonus”) and (b) an amount equal to one or two times the executive’s then base salary plus the
Highest Annual Bonus;

 

 •  continued health benefits for two years; and
 

 
•  outplacement services through the end of the second calendar year following the year in which the executive’s termination

occurs, up to a maximum cost to the Company of $30,000.

Under the Change-of-Control Employment Agreements, we have also agreed to reimburse the executive for any excise tax due on
any severance compensation (whether under the Change-of-Control Employment Agreements or otherwise), including any additional
federal, state and local income tax consequences, as a result thereof.

Table of Contents

For purposes of the Change-of-Control Employment Agreements, “cause” means the occurrence of any of the following, as
determined in good faith by the applicable executive:
 

 

•  the willful and continued failure of the executive to perform substantially the executive’s duties with the Company or one of
its affiliates (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand
for substantial performance is delivered to the executive by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company which
specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that the executive has not
substantially performed the executive’s duties, or;

 

 
•  the willful engaging by the executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious

to the Company.

No act or failure to act, on the part of the executive, will be considered “willful” unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the
executive in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the executive’s action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any
act, or failure to act, based upon authority given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the
Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively
presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, by the executive in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. The cessation of
employment of the executive shall not be deemed to be for cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the executive a
copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a
meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the executive and the executive is given
an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the executive
is guilty of the conduct described above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

For purposes of the Change-of-Control Employment Agreements, “good reason” means the occurrence of any of the following, as
determined in good faith by the applicable executive:
 

 

•  the assignment to the executive of any duties inconsistent in any respect with the executive’s position (including status,
offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities as contemplated by the agreement, or any other
action by the Company which results in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this
purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company
promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the executive;

 

 
•  any failure by the Company to comply with any of the provisions of the agreement setting forth the executive’s

compensation, other than an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and which is remedied
by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by the executive;

 

 
•  the Company’s requiring the executive to be based at any office or location other than as provided in the agreement or the

Company’s requiring the executive to travel on Company business to a substantially greater extent than required
immediately prior to the date a change of control occurs;

 

 
•  any purported termination by the Company of the executive’s employment otherwise than as expressly permitted by the

agreement; or
 

 
•  any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy the provision of the agreement requiring any successor to assume the

agreement.

For purposes of the Change-of-Control Employment Agreements, “Change of Control” is generally defined as any of the
following:
 

 •  the acquisition by a person or group of 20% or more of our outstanding stock;
 

 •  a change of a majority of the Board without approval of the Board;

Table of Contents

 

•  the consummation of a reorganization, merger, consolidation or asset sale, except where our shareholders receive 50% or
more of the stock of the resulting company, at least a majority of the board of the resulting company was on the Board of the
Company prior to the transaction and after which no shareholder owns 20% or more of the stock of the resulting company
which did not own such stock immediately prior to the transaction; or

 

 •  the approval of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

Executive Employment Agreements

Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger are also, individually, party to an employment agreement with the Company that provides that if
the executive’s employment is terminated by the Company other than for “cause,” death, or disability or by the executive for “good
reason” (as such terms are defined in the agreement) at any time, the executive will be entitled to receive cash severance and
continuation of health benefits, among other things, subject to the executive’s execution of a release of claims. However, in the event
the executive becomes entitled to severance or benefits under his Change-of-Control Employment Agreement with the Company, the
executive will no longer be entitled to the severance benefits under the terms of the executive’s employment agreement. Therefore, if
Messrs. Tacelli and Gallenberger are terminated by the Company other than for “cause”, death or “disability” or by the executive for
“good reason”, or for any other reason solely during the 30-day period following the first anniversary of the assumed date of the
completion of the Merger (August 30, 2017) (or upon certain terminations prior to the Merger or in connection with or in anticipation
of the Merger), the executive will not be entitled to receive severance benefits under the terms of the executive’s employment
agreement and, accordingly, such benefits and terms are not summarized in this Proxy Statement.

Mr. Rondé is also party to an employment agreement with our French subsidiary. Under the terms of Mr. Rondé’s employment
agreement, Mr. Rondé is entitled to receive the following compensation in the event his employment is terminated by us, except in the
case of his gross or willful misconduct, subject to Mr. Rondé executing and not revoking a Company provided settlement agreement:
 

 
•  a termination indemnity equal to one year of Mr. Rondé’s gross base salary, inclusive of any amount of dismissal or

retirement indemnity that Mr. Rondé may otherwise be entitled to under any applicable collective bargaining agreement;
 

 
•  a pro rata portion of Mr. Rondé’s target annual incentive bonus (based on the target bonus percentage in effect as of the

termination date); and
 

 
•  an amount equal to Mr. Rondé’s target annual incentive bonus (based on the target bonus percentage in effect as of the

termination date).

Pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement of “Metallurgie (ingenieurs et cadres),” which is applicable to all employees of
our French subsidiary, if Mr. Rondé retires he may be entitled to receive a social payment from the Company. In Mr. Rondé’s case,
such social payment could be an amount up to two months of his then current salary. To the extent that we are required to make the
severance payments described above to Mr. Rondé, we will not be required to make the social payment under the collective bargaining
agreement.

2010 Stock Plan

Our 2010 Stock Plan provides that all unvested RSUs will become vested in full if the participant is terminated without “cause”
(as defined in the 2010 Stock Plan) by the Company or an acquiring or succeeding corporation within one year after a “change in
control event” (as defined in the 2010 Stock Plan and which includes the Merger). In summary, “cause” is defined in the 2010 Stock
Plan as (i) willful failure by the participant, which failure is not cured within 30 days of written notice to the participant from the
Company, to perform his or her material responsibilities to the Company or (ii) willful misconduct by the participant which affects the
business reputation of the Company, with the participant being considered to have been discharged for

Table of Contents

“cause” if the Company determines, within 30 days after the participant’s resignation, that discharge for cause was warranted.

Exchange and Payment Procedures

Prior to the closing of the Merger, Parent will designate a U.S. bank or trust company, which we refer to as the “payment agent,”
to make payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration to stockholders. At or immediately following the Effective Time, Parent will
deposit or cause to be deposited with the payment agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to
stockholders.

Promptly following the Effective Time, the payment agent will send to each holder of record of shares of common stock a letter
of transmittal and instructions advising stockholders how to surrender stock certificates and book-entry shares in exchange for their
portion of the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon receipt of (1) surrendered certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
book-entry shares representing shares of common stock; and (2) a signed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such shares will be entitled to receive their portion of the Per Share Merger
Consideration in exchange therefor. The amount of any Per Share Merger Consideration paid to the stockholders may be reduced by
any applicable withholding taxes.

If any cash deposited with the payment agent is not claimed within nine months following the Effective Time, such cash will be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of common stock who have not complied with the exchange
procedures in the Merger Agreement will thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation, as general creditor for payment of the Per
Share Merger Consideration.

The letter of transmittal will include instructions if a stockholder has lost a share certificate or if such certificate has been stolen
or destroyed. In the event any certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then before such stockholder will be entitled to receive
the Per Share Merger consideration, such stockholder will have to make an affidavit of the loss, theft or destruction, and if required by
Parent or the payment agent, deliver a bond in such amount as Parent or the payment agent may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such certificate.

Representations and Warranties

The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub.

Some of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement made by the Company are qualified as to “materiality” or
“Company Material Adverse Effect.” For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Company Material Adverse Effect” means, with respect
to the Company, a material adverse effect on (a) the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or (b) the business, operations, assets, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, however, that none of the following will be taken into account when
determining whether a “Company Material Adverse Effect” has occurred or may, would or could occur:
 

 
•  general economic conditions (or changes in such conditions) in the United States or any other country or region in the world,

or conditions in the global economy generally;
 

 

•  conditions (or changes in such conditions) in the securities markets, capital markets, credit markets, currency markets or
other financial markets in the United States or any other country or region in the world, including (A) changes in interest
rates in the United States or any other country or region in the world and changes in exchange rates for the currencies of any
countries and (B) any suspension of trading in securities (whether equity, debt, derivative or hybrid securities) generally on
any securities exchange or over-the-counter market operating in the United States or any other country or region in the
world;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any condition or situation described in any of the first six items described in the
above bullet points has a disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in comparison to other
companies operating in the industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate that is affected by such condition or situation,
they will not be excluded from a determination of whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred and, in such case, the
incremental disproportionate impact or impacts may be taken into account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect
has occurred.

Go-Shop Period; Alternative Acquisition Proposals

Go-Shop Period

Notwithstanding the below, from the period beginning on the date of the Merger Agreement and continuing until 11:59 p.m. (New
York City time) on May 12, 2017 (the “Go-Shop Period End Date”), the Company and its subsidiaries and their respective
representatives are permitted to:
 

 
•  Take any action to initiate, solicit, induce and encourage, facilitate and assist with, whether publicly or otherwise, any

acquisition proposals (as defined below) (or any inquiries or the making of any proposals, expressions of interest or other
offers or attempts that could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal);

 

 
•  Provide access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the

Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to (but only pursuant to) certain permitted confidentiality agreements; or
 

 

•  Enter into, participate or engage in, and maintain discussions, communications or negotiations with respect to any
acquisition proposal (or any inquiries or the making of any proposals, expressions of interest or other offers or attempts that
could reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal) or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or
facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, offers, efforts, attempts, discussions, communications or negotiations.

Xcerra will promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) following the Go-Shop Period End Date provide Parent a
list of each person or group from whom the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives has received a
bona fide written acquisition proposal after the date of the Merger Agreement and on or prior to the Go-Shop Period End Date that
satisfies certain requirements enumerated in the Merger Agreement (each an “Excluded Party”), including the identity of each
Excluded Party.

On and after May 13, 2017, Xcerra will promptly notify Parent in writing if the Company or any of its subsidiaries or their
respective representatives receives, including from an Excluded Party, any (i) acquisition proposal, (ii) any request for information or
access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or personnel of the Company or any of its subsidiaries that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an acquisition proposal or (iii) any inquiry with respect to, or which could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
acquisition proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, at any time after May 13, 2017, Xcerra may continue to engage in the activities
described in this section, and the restrictions under the heading “Acquisition Proposals” below will not apply to, any Excluded Party
(but only for so long as such person or group is an Excluded Party), including with respect to any amended or modified acquisition
proposal submitted by any Excluded Party following May 13, 2017.

During the go-shop period, at the direction and under the supervision of the Board and members of the Company’s management,
representatives of Cowen contacted parties that, in the view of the Board might be capable of, and might be interested in pursuing an
acquisition with the Company. During the go-shop period, one

party (“Party I”) executed a confidentiality agreement and was granted access to certain non-public information regarding the
Company. On April 14, 2017, Party I indicated to members of the Company’s management that Party I was not interested in pursuing a
strategic transaction involving the Company. No other party submitted an alternative acquisition proposal to the Company during the
go-shop period.

Acquisition Proposals

Except as may relate to an Excluded Party (but only for so long as such person is an Excluded Party), upon May 13, 2017, the
Company and its subsidiaries and their respective representatives are required to cease any activities described in the immediately
preceding section under the heading “Go-Shop Period” and, from May 13, 2017, until the earlier to occur of the termination of the
Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company has agreed not to, and to cause its subsidiaries and its and their respective
representatives not to:
 

 
•  solicit, initiate or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, an

acquisition proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;
 

 

•  furnish to any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub) any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or afford to any person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of
Parent or Merger Sub) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public information, or to any
personnel, of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in any such case with respect to, or with the intent to induce,
encourage, facilitate or assist in the making, submission or announcement of an acquisition proposal or the making of an
inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

 

 

•  enter into, continue or otherwise participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any person (other than Parent,
Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub) with respect to, or with the intent to induce, encourage, facilitate or
assist in the making, submission or announcement of, an acquisition proposal or any inquiries, proposal or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an acquisition proposal;

 

 
•  agree to, approve, endorse, recommend or consummate any acquisition proposal or enter into any letter of intent,

memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle or similar document, or any contract contemplating or otherwise
relating to an acquisition transaction, other than certain permitted confidentiality agreements; or

 

 
•  grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any equity securities of the Company or

any of its subsidiaries or their respective assets or properties.

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders,
if the Board receives from any person a bona fide, written and unsolicited acquisition proposal not involving a breach of the Merger
Agreement, then the Board may provide information to, and engage or participate in negotiations or substantive discussions with, such
person regarding an acquisition proposal if the Board determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisor and its
outside legal counsel that such proposal is a superior proposal (as defined below) or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior
proposal; provided that (1) the Board and/or any authorized committee thereof has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties and
(2) the Company gives Parent prior written notice of the Company’s intention to participate or engage in discussions or negotiations
with, or furnish non-public information to, such person.

For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement:

“Acquisition proposal” means any offer or proposal (other than an offer or proposal by Parent or Merger Sub) to engage in an
acquisition transaction.

Table of Contents

“Acquisition transaction” means any transaction or series of related transactions (other than the Merger) involving:
 

 

(1) any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any person or “group” (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act), whether from the Company and/or any other person(s), of shares of the Company’s capital stock
representing more than 20% of the shares of the Company’s capital stock outstanding after giving effect to the
consummation of such purchase or other acquisition, including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any person or
“group” (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would
result in such person or “group” beneficially owning more than 20% of the shares of the Company’s capital stock
outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or acquisition;

 

 
(2) any direct or indirect purchase or other acquisition by any person or “group” (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the

Exchange Act) of more than 20% of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole (measured
by the fair market value thereof as of the date of such sale, transfer, acquisition or disposition);

 

 

(3) any merger, consolidation, business combination or other similar transaction involving the Company pursuant to which any
person or “group” (as defined in or under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than the Company’s stockholders (as a
group) immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction, would hold shares of the Company’s capital stock
representing more than 20% of the shares of the Company’s capital stock outstanding after giving effect to the
consummation of such transaction; or

 

 (4) a liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Company.

“Superior proposal” means any bona fide written acquisition proposal for an acquisition transaction, not resulting from a breach
of the Company’s non-solicitation obligations under the Merger Agreement, which the Board will have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel), taking into account all relevant legal, financial and regulatory aspects
of such acquisition proposal and the likelihood of consummation of such acquisition transaction, is reasonably capable of being
consummated on a timely basis and would be more favorable from a financial point of view to the Company’s stockholders (in their
capacity as such) than the Merger and the failure of the Board to approve or recommend such acquisition proposal would be
inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties, after taking into account any written offers made by Parent in accordance with the
terms of the Merger Agreement to modify the terms or conditions of the Merger Agreement; provided, however, that for purposes of
the reference to an “acquisition proposal” in this definition of a “superior proposal,” all references to “more than twenty percent
(20%)” in the definition of “acquisition transaction” will be deemed to be references to “a majority.”

The Board’s Recommendation; Company Board Recommendation Change

As described above, and subject to the provisions described below, the Board has made the recommendation that the holders of
shares of common stock vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that the Board will
not effect a company board recommendation change except as described below.

Prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders, the Board may not (with any action described in the following
being referred to as a “company board recommendation change”):
 

 
•  withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,

qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the company board recommendation;
 

 •  approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, an acquisition proposal;

 •  fail to include the company board recommendation in the proxy statement;
 

 
•  fail to publicly recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for shares of the Company’s capital

stock within ten business days after the commencement of such offer; or
 

 
•  fail to publicly reaffirm the board recommendation following any acquisition proposal having been publicly made, proposed

or communicated (and not publicly withdrawn) within ten business days after Parent so requests in writing.

The Board may only effect a company board recommendation change for an intervening event if the Board determines (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect a company board recommendation change in response to such
intervening event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, and:
 

 
•  the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent, which notice will include the reason (in reasonable detail) for such

company board recommendation change; and
 

 

•  if requested by Parent, the Company has, during the period beginning on the date of delivery of written notice of an
intervening event and ending on the fifth business day following such delivery date, made its representatives available to
discuss the intervening event with Parent’s representatives and negotiated with Parent in good faith (to the extent that Parent
desires to so negotiate) to make modifications to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that the Board (or a
committee thereof) no longer determines that the failure to make a company board recommendation change in response to
such intervening event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations pursuant to applicable law.

In addition, the Board may only effect a company board recommendation change in response to a bona fide acquisition proposal
that the Board has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a superior proposal
if:
 

 
•  the bona fide written acquisition proposal was not solicited in violation of the Company’s non-solicitation obligations under

the Merger Agreement;
 

 
•  the Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect a company

board recommendation change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties;
 

 

•  the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent of the superior proposal, which notice will include the terms and
conditions of, and the identity of the person making, such superior proposal and a copy of the proposed agreement under
which such superior proposal is proposed to consummated and any other material transaction documents, and the Company
has provided new written notice to Parent with respect to any amendment to the material terms of such superior proposal;

 

 

•  if requested by Parent, the Company has made its representatives available to discuss with Parent’s representatives any
proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement during the period beginning as soon as
practicable on the day of delivery by the Company to Parent of the superior proposal notice or superior proposal amendment
notice, as applicable, and ending on the fifth business day following the day of such delivery or, in the case of a superior
proposal amendment notice, the third business day following the day of such delivery;

 

 

•  the Company has, during the five business day or such additional three business day notice period described above, as
applicable, negotiated with Parent and its representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement so that such acquisition proposal would cease
to constitute a superior proposal;

 

 
•  if Parent will have delivered to the Company during such five business day or such additional three business day period

described above, as applicable, a written offer to modify the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Board (or a committee
thereof) will have determined in good faith, after considering

the terms of such offer by Parent, that the superior proposal giving rise to such superior proposal notice or superior proposal
amendment notice, as applicable, still constitutes a superior proposal and the failure to make a company board
recommendation change would be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary duties; and

 

 •  the Company will have paid, or caused the payment of, the applicable termination fee pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

For purposes of this proxy statement and the Merger Agreement, an “intervening event” means any circumstance, event, change,
development, occurrence, state of facts, condition or effect occurring or arising after the date of the Merger Agreement (other than and
not related to an acquisition proposal) that was neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Board on or prior to the date of the
Merger Agreement and that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided that none of the following
(whether alone or in combination) will constitute or be deemed to contribute to an intervening event: (i) changes in the Company’s
stock price or the trading volume of the Company’s stock (though the underlying causes of such changes that are not otherwise
excluded from the definition of “intervening event” may be taken into account); (ii) the fact, in and of itself, that the Company meets or
exceeds any public estimates or expectations of the Company’s revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of
operations for any period (though the underlying causes of such performance that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of
“intervening event” may be taken into account); (iii) the fact, in and of itself, that the Company meets or exceeds internal budgets,
plans or forecasts of its revenues, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations (though the underlying causes of such
performance that are not otherwise excluded from the definition of “intervening event” may be taken into account); (iv) any events,
changes or circumstances relating to Parent or any of its affiliates; and (v) any events, changes or circumstances relating to the launch
of any new products or services by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Employee Benefits

Parent has agreed to cause the Surviving Corporation to honor the terms of certain of the Company’s benefit plans for a period of
one year following the Effective Time, except that the Surviving Corporation may amend or terminate such plans in accordance with
their terms or if required by applicable law. For a period of one year following the Effective Time, all employees of the Company who
remain employed by the Surviving Corporation following the Merger, which we refer to as “continuing employees,” will be provided
employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than such employee benefits provided to the continuing employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time (any such employee benefit plans other than equity-based benefits and individual employment
agreements are referred to in this proxy statement as “Company Plans”). Base salary, bonus opportunity or regular wages as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will not be decreased for a period of one year following the Effective Time for any continuing
employees.

The Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) use reasonable best efforts to cause to be
granted to any continuing employee credit under the Company Plans in which the continuing employee participates after the Merger
for all service with the Company and its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation, sick time or paid time off accrual and
severance pay entitlement). However, such service need not be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or
benefits.

In addition, to the extent commercially reasonable (i) each continuing employee will be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries other than
the Company Plans (which we refer to as “New Plans”) to the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage under a
comparable Company Plan in which such continuing employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (which we refer to
as “Old

Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits to any
continuing employee, the Surviving Corporation will cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of
insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such continuing employee
and his or her covered dependents to the extent it would have been waived under the comparable Old Plan, and the Surviving
Corporation will cause any eligible expenses incurred by such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents during any
unfinished portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such continuing employee’s participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be given full credit under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) the Surviving Corporation will credit the accounts of such
continuing employee under any New Plan which is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such continuing
employee under the applicable Company Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a continuing employee as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time will be credited to such continuing employee following the Effective Time, and will not be
subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and will not limit future accruals.

Financing

Xcerra has agreed that it will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent in connection with the arrangement of any third-party debt or
equity financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent, subject to certain exceptions described below. The receipt of such debt
financing and equity financing are not conditions to the Merger.

Agreement in the ordinary course of business (and in accordance with the timeframe in which such information has been
produced) and (iii) is customarily needed for financings of the type contemplated by the Commitment Letters and related
financing documents; provided, that the Company will have satisfied its obligation if the Company will have used its
reasonable efforts to comply with such obligations; and provided further that nothing contained in the Merger Agreement
will require the Company to furnish to Parent or any other person any pro forma financial statements or any adjustments,
estimates, projection, forecasts or other information in connection with the preparation of financial statements;

 

 
•  assisting with the preparation of bank information memoranda, business projections and similar documents required in

connection with the financing;

encumbrances and contracts to which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is a party to the extent required by the
financing sources

 •  unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or its subsidiaries;
 

 
•  require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to waive or amend the terms of the Merger Agreement or pay any

commitment or other similar fee or incur or assume any other liability or obligation in connection with the financing, in each
case, prior to the Effective Time;

 

 
•  require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to authorize, execute or perform any agreement with respect to the financing,

in each case, prior to the Effective Time;
 

 

•  (A) contravene any applicable law or the organizational documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or require the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to disclose information subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other
legal privilege, (B) cause any covenant, representation or warranty in the Merger Agreement to be breached by the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or (C) cause any representative of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to incur or potentially
incur any personal liability;

 

 
•  require the Company or any of its subsidiaries to deliver or cause to be delivered any financial information in a form not

customarily prepared by the Company or with respect to a month or fiscal period that has not yet ended or has ended less
than 45 days prior to the date of such request (or 90 days with respect to a fiscal-year end); or

 

 
•  require the Company, any of its subsidiaries, or any person who is an officer or director of the Company or any of its

subsidiaries to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution of the financing or deliver any certificate,
instrument or document in connection with the financing that is effective prior to the closing of the Merger.

In addition, Parent will promptly, upon written request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Company’s, its subsidiaries’ or their respective
representatives’ obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to the financing. Parent will also indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, its subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs
or expenses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the financing, the arrangement of the financing, the performance of their
obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to the financing and any information utilized in connection with the financing,
except to the extent suffered or incurred as a result of (1) any inaccurate or misleading financial information relating to the Company
and its subsidiaries provided by the Company in writing specifically for use in connection with the financing and (2) the fraud, bad
faith or willful breach by the Company or any of its subsidiaries of its obligations under the Merger Agreement with respect to the
financing.

Efforts to Close the Merger

Subject to the exceptions set forth in the following paragraph, under the Merger Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agree to use reasonable best efforts to take all actions and assist and cooperate with the other parties, in each case as
necessary, proper and advisable pursuant to applicable law or otherwise to consummate the Merger.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with obtaining HSR antitrust clearance, none of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company is required to agree to any term or take any action that (i) is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or (ii) would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Moreover,

in connection with obtaining CFIUS approval, Parent and Merger Sub are not obligation to take any mitigation steps that (a) would
reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the business or financial condition of the Company or its subsidiaries, including any
steps that would adversely affect the LTX-Credence and/or ECT businesses or material product lines in any material respect, (b) would
reasonably be expected to reduce the reasonably expected benefits of the Merger to Parent or its affiliates in an amount that is
financially material relative to the value of the Company and its subsidiaries or (c) are set forth on a confidential schedule agreed
between the parties.

Indemnification and Insurance

The Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to)

the Merger Agreement pursuant to the terms of such agreements as in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement and (y) any person
who becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and executes an indemnification
agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company and no more favorable to such person than the current form of indemnification
agreement with its directors that has been made available to Parent and (ii) any and all indemnification, expense advancement and
exculpation provisions in any articles of organization or bylaws or comparable organizational document of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries in effect on the date of the Merger Agreement, in each case until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time.

The Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to), for a
period of six years from the Effective Time, cause the articles of organization, bylaws or other organizational documents of the
Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation, advancement of expenses
and limitation of director and officer liability that are at least as favorable to the current or former directors and officers of the
Company and its subsidiaries as those set forth in the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ organizational documents as of the date of the
Merger Agreement. The Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries will not, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, amend,
repeal or otherwise modify such provisions in the organizational documents in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the
current or former directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries.

The Merger Agreement also provides that, prior to the Effective Time, the Company will purchase a six year prepaid “tail” policy
on the Company’s current officers and directors liability insurance, provided that the Company will not pay, and Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay, annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for such
coverage for its last full fiscal year. The Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such
“tail” policy in full force and effect. The “tail” policy will cover claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement.

Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. In computing the number of shares beneficially

deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Unless otherwise indicated below, the
address of each beneficial owner listed in the table is c/o Xcerra Corporation, 825 University Avenue, Norwood, MA 02062.

The percentages in the table below are based on 54,711,698 shares of common stock outstanding as of August 30, 2017. Except

FUTURE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS

If the Merger is completed, the Company will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future
meetings of stockholders of the Company. However, if the Merger is not completed, the Company’s stockholders will continue to be
entitled to attend and participate in stockholder meetings.

In light of the expected timing of the completion of the Merger, the Company expects to hold its 2017 annual meeting of
stockholders only if the Merger is not completed or if the Company is otherwise required to do so under applicable law.

Proposals of stockholders that are intended for inclusion in our proxy statement relating to our annual meeting in 2017, if held,
must be received by us at our offices at 825 University Avenue, Norwood, Massachusetts 02062, Attention: Corporate Secretary, no
later than the close of business on the date that is 120 calendar days before the date of the Company’s proxy statement released to
stockholders in connection with the previous year’s annual meeting, or if the date of this year’s annual meeting has been changed by
more than 30 days from the date of the previous year’s meeting, then the deadline is a reasonable time before the Company begins to
print and send its proxy materials. Proposals of stockholders that are intended for inclusion in our proxy statement relating to our
annual meeting in 2017 must satisfy the conditions established by the SEC, including, but not limited to, Rule 14a-8 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, and in our bylaws for stockholder proposals in order to be included in our proxy statement for that meeting.

Provided we do not change our meeting date for the annual meeting in 2017, if held, notices of stockholder proposals submitted
pursuant to Rule 14a-8 must be submitted on or before June 30, 2017.

terms that the Company Board determines, in its good faith judgment, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, and after taking into account all relevant legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and the
likelihood of consummation of such Acquisition Transaction, is reasonably capable of being consummated on a timely basis and would
be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Company Stockholders (in their capacity as such) than the Merger and the
failure of the Company Board to approve or recommend such Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary
duties under Massachusetts Law (after taking into account any written offers made by Parent in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement to modify the terms or conditions of this Agreement); provided that for purposes of the reference to an “Acquisition
Proposal” in this definition of a “Superior Proposal,” each reference to “more than twenty percent (20%)” in the definition of
“Acquisition Transaction” shall be replaced with “a majority.”

ARTICLE II
THE MERGER

2.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
MBCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall thereupon cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent. The Company, as the surviving corporation of the Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the “Surviving Corporation.”

2.2 The Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated under the MBCA by filing the articles of merger in such form
as required by, and executed in accordance with, the MBCA (the “Articles of Merger”) with the Secretary of the Commonwealth of

the “Effective Time”).

2.3 The Closing. The consummation of the Merger shall take place at a closing (the “Closing”) to occur at 10:00 a.m. (New York

agreed upon by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, which date shall be no later than the second Business Day after the satisfaction
of the last to be satisfied of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are only capable of
being satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or written waiver (where permissible) of those conditions at the Closing),
unless Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall mutually agree upon another location, date and time in writing. The date upon which
the Closing shall actually occur pursuant hereto is referred to herein as the “Closing Date.”

2.4 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the MBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all of the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

2.5 Articles of Organization and Bylaws.

and restated articles of organization shall be the articles of organization of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the MBCA and such articles of organization (subject to the provisions of Section 6.10(a));
provided that at the Effective Time the articles of organization of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be “Xcerra Corporation.”

(b) Bylaws. At the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Section 6.10(a), the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the MBCA, the articles of organization of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws (subject to the
provisions of Section  6.10(a)).

2.6 Directors and Officers.

(a) Directors. At the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of organization and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified,
whichever is earlier.

(b) Officers. At the Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of organization and bylaws of the

2.7 Effect on Capital Stock.

(a) Capital Stock. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of any of the following securities,
the following shall occur:

(i) Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than (A) Cancelled Company Shares and (B) Dissenting Company Shares) shall be cancelled and extinguished
and automatically converted into, and thereafter represent only, the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon, upon the surrender of the certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock or
the Uncertificated Shares in accordance with Section 2.8 (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an
affidavit in the manner provided in Section 2.10).

(ii) Excluded Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company (including any such shares held in the treasury of the Company), or by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent or Merger Sub, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time (“Cancelled Company Shares”) shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

(iii) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall thereafter evidence
ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Adjustment to the Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect
of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the granting or

other issuance of Company Options or Company Restricted Stock Units permitted by Section 5.1(b) of this Agreement),
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Statutory Rights of Appraisal.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all shares of Company Common Stock that
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall neither have voted in
favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have properly and validly perfected, and not effectively withdrawn
or lost, their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 13.02 of the
MBCA (collectively, “Dissenting Company Shares”) shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(i). Such Company Stockholder shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the
MBCA to a holder of Dissenting Company Shares. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Company Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and each Company Stockholder who holds Dissenting Company
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting
Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.02 of the MBCA; provided that all Dissenting Company Shares held
by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of
such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 13.02 of the MBCA shall no longer be considered to be Dissenting Company
Shares and shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably lost or withdrawn or has expired, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such shares of
Company Common Stock or the Uncertificated Shares in the manner provided in Section 2.8.

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal received by the Company,
withdrawals and attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Massachusetts Law and
received by the Company with respect to rights to appraisal or in respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the right to direct and
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Massachusetts Law in respect of Dissenting
Company Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to or
approve any withdrawal of any demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demands for payment, in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares.

(d) Company Compensatory Awards. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of such Company Restricted Stock Units or Company
Performance Restricted Stock Units, each Company Restricted Stock Unit and Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit that
remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as set forth in this Section 2.7(d).

(i) Each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is outstanding and either (A) vests at the Effective Time or (B) is held
by a non-employee member of the Company Board (each, a “Vested Restricted Stock Unit”) shall be cancelled and terminated as of
the Effective Time and the holder thereof shall receive, subject to Section 2.8(e), an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Vested Restricted
Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) the Merger Consideration (the “Restricted Stock Unit Consideration”).
The Company shall pay to each holder of a Vested Restricted Stock Unit the Restricted Stock Unit Consideration described in the
immediately preceding sentence (through the Company’s or a Company Subsidiary’s payroll system, or the Company’s or a Company
Subsidiary’s equity award administrator, as may be applicable and in accordance with the Company’s payroll practices for service
providers located outside of the United States) on either (A) the first regularly scheduled payroll date after the Closing or (B) if such
first payroll

date is scheduled for payment prior to the fifth Business Day after the Closing, the second regularly scheduled payroll date after the
Closing, in any such case, consistent with past practices, including accounting for all applicable withholding.

(ii) Each Company Restricted Stock Unit that is outstanding and unvested as of the Effective Time and not described
in Section 2.7(d)(i) (an “Unvested Restricted Stock Unit”) shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, be converted into the right to receive, subject to Section 2.8(e), an amount of cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Unvested Restricted Stock Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) the Merger Consideration (the “Unvested Restricted Stock Unit Consideration”). The
Unvested Restricted Stock Unit Consideration will be subject to the same vesting terms and conditions applicable to the Company
Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the same vesting restrictions and continued service
requirements, except for administrative changes that are not adverse to the holder of the Company Restricted Stock Unit or to which
the holder consents. Payment of the Unvested Restricted Stock Unit Consideration shall be made, subject to such terms and conditions,
on the vesting dates applicable to the Company Restricted Stock Units as described in this Section 2.7(d)(ii).

(iii) Effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, the performance-based vesting of each Company Performance
Restricted Stock Unit that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be accelerated in full with all
performance conditions being deemed achieved at 100% and each such Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit shall, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, be converted into the right to receive, subject to Section 2.8(e), an
amount of cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (y) the Merger
Consideration (the “Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit Consideration”). The Company Performance Restricted Stock
Unit Consideration will be subject to the same time-based vesting terms and conditions applicable to the Company Performance
Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for administrative changes that are not adverse to the holder of
the Company Performance Restricted Stock Unit or to which the holder consents. Payment of the Company Performance Restricted
Stock Unit Consideration shall be made, subject to such terms and conditions, on the time-based vesting dates applicable to the
Company Performance Restricted Stock Units as described in this Section 2.7(d)(iii).

(e) The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by Section 2.7(d) under
all Company Restricted Stock Unit agreements and any other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all required
notices and obtaining any required consent. As promptly as practicable after the Closing, Parent shall pay by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Surviving Corporation, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each of the
holders of Vested Restricted Stock Units, the Restricted Stock Unit Consideration (through the Surviving Corporation’s or a Surviving
Corporation Subsidiary’s payroll system, or the Surviving Corporation’s or a Surviving Corporation’s Subsidiary equity award
administrator, as may be applicable and in accordance with the Company’s payroll practices for service providers located outside of the
United States) on either (A) the first regularly scheduled payroll date after the Closing or (B) if such first payroll date is scheduled for
payment prior to the fifth Business Day after the Closing, the second regularly scheduled payroll date after the Closing, in any such
case, consistent with past practices, including accounting for all applicable withholding. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall
not take any action after the date of this Agreement that would accelerate the vesting of the Company Restricted Stock Units in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) Company ESPP. The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to: (i) cause any offering period and purchase
period (or similar period during which shares may be purchased) underway as of the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP
to be terminated as of no later than the last payroll date immediately preceding the Effective Time (the “Final Exercise Date”);
(ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect any shortened offering period or purchase period (or similar period),
but otherwise treat any

such shortened offering period or purchase period (or similar period) as a fully effective and completed offering period or purchase
period, as applicable, for all purposes under the Company ESPP; (iii) cause each participant’s shares purchase right under the Company
ESPP (the “Company ESPP Rights”) outstanding as of the Final Exercise Date to be exercised as of the Final Exercise Date;
(iv) provide that no further offering periods or purchase periods (or similar periods during which shares may be purchased) shall
commence under the Company ESPP on or after the date of this Agreement; (v) provide that no participant in the Company ESPP may
increase the rate of his or her contributions to the Company ESPP on or after the date of this Agreement; (vi) provide that no individual
who is not participating in the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may commence participation in the Company ESPP on
or after the date of this Agreement; and (vii) terminate the Company ESPP as of the Final Exercise Date, provided, however, that
termination of the Company ESPP shall be subject to the consummation of the Merger. Each outstanding option under the Company
ESPP on the Final Exercise Date shall be exercised on such date for the purchase of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of the Company ESPP. On the Final Exercise Date, the funds credited as of such date under the Company ESPP within the
associated accumulated payroll withholding account for each participant under the Company ESPP will be used to purchase shares in
accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and each share purchased by a participant of the Company ESPP and issued
thereunder will be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Section 2.7, subject to withholding of applicable income and employment withholding Taxes. No further Company ESPP Rights will
be granted after the date of this Agreement, and no further Company ESPP Rights will be exercised under the Company ESPP after the
Final Exercise Date. The Company shall provide timely notice of the setting of the Final Exercise Date and termination of the
Company ESPP in accordance with the Company ESPP (which termination will be subject to the consummation of the Merger).

(g) Treatment of Company Stock Plan. Effective as of, and contingent upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time, the
Company, acting through the Company Board or the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions which are reasonably necessary to terminate the Company Stock Plan. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to
issue Company Common Stock or other share capital of the Company or the Surviving Corporation to any Person pursuant to or in
settlement of a Company Option or Company Restricted Stock Unit. Promptly following the date hereof, the Company shall deliver
written notice to each holder of a Company Restricted Stock Unit informing such holder of the treatment of their Company Restricted
Stock Units contemplated by this Agreement.

2.8 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Payment Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a U.S. bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to act as the payment agent for the Merger (the
“Payment Agent”).

(b) Exchange Fund. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.7(a)(i), an amount of cash equal to the
aggregate consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock become entitled thereunder (the “Aggregate Consideration”).
Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such funds shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as
directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or obligations of an
agency of the United States government (such cash amount being referred to herein as the “Exchange Fund”). Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments
of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Payment Agent to promptly
pay the cash amounts contemplated by Section 2.7(a)(i), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the
Payment Agent to make such payments contemplated by Section 2.7(a)(i).

(c) Payment Procedures. Promptly following the Effective Time (and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the
Effective Time), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or certificates (the “Certificates”) that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the
“Uncertificated Shares”), in each case, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.7(a)(i), (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent) and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.7(a)(i). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent (in the case of
Certificated shares) together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as the Payment Agent may reasonably require, the holders of such Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares that were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(i), by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding taxes payable in accordance with Section 2.8(e)), and the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.8(c), in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, upon receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Payment Agent and confirmation of the book-entry transfer of such
Uncertificated Shares into the Payment Agent’s account with Depository Trust Company (and such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Payment Agent may reasonably request), the holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such holder’s transferred Uncertificated Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.7(a)(i), by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable withholding taxes payable in accordance with
Section 2.8(e)), and the transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The Payment Agent shall accept
such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

(d) Transfers of Ownership. In the event that a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock is not registered
in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in which the
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated
Share so surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and only if the Person requesting such payment has paid
to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares or established to the satisfaction
of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable. Parent shall pay all other
transfer taxes.

(e) Required Withholding. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their agents shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Laws, it being understood that no deduction or withholding shall be required
under the Tax Law of a jurisdiction outside the United States with respect to payments to holders of Company Common Stock by
reason of Parent (or any other

direct or indirect owner of Merger Sub) being organized outside the United States. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted and
withheld and paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any other Person shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund remaining unclaimed immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Persons previously entitled thereto.

(g) Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of
the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares on the date that is nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation upon demand, and any holders of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Merger who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or Uncertificated Shares representing such shares of Company
Common Stock for exchange pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.8 shall thereafter look for payment of the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
solely to the Surviving Corporation, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger Consideration (without interest
and subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II.

2.9 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.8. Any Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of the Company Common Stock represented thereby. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades
effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case
of Dissenting Company Shares.

2.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon
the making of an affidavit and undertaking of an indemnity, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Payment Agent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such customary amount as Parent or the Payment Agent may determine is reasonable and appropriate as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Payment Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 2.7.

for a meeting of the Company Stockholders (such meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the “Company Stockholder
Meeting”) for the purpose of voting to approve the Merger in accordance with the MBCA and commence a broker search pursuant to
Section 14a-13 of the Exchange Act in connection therewith. The Company shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than 60 calendar days) after the Proxy Statement
is disseminated to Company Stockholders; provided that nothing herein shall prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the
Company Stockholder Meeting on any occasion if (i) there are holders of insufficient shares of the Company Common Stock present or
represented by a proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting, (ii) the
Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable Law, Order or a request from the SEC or
its staff, or (iii) after prior consultation with Parent, the Company Board or any authorized committee thereof shall have determined in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting in order to (A) give Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that the
Company has sent to Company Stockholders or otherwise made available to Company Stockholders by issuing a press release, filing
materials with the SEC or otherwise (including in connection with a Company Board Recommendation Change) or (B) to provide
additional time to solicit proxies from Company Stockholders; provided, further, that the Company shall not postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting to a date that is less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Termination Date in the case of the

Change specifically permitted by Section 6.5, the Company shall solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the
approval of the Merger in accordance with Massachusetts Law, submit the Merger for approval of the Company Stockholders at the
Company Stockholder Meeting, recommend to the Company Stockholders that they adopt this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and use its reasonable best efforts to secure the Requisite
Stockholder Approval at the Company Stockholder Meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that
its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.4(b) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company or any other Person of any Acquisition Proposal or the occurrence of any Company
Board Recommendation Change, unless such Company Board Recommendation Change is specifically permitted by Section 6.5.

a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, endorse or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, (iv) if a tender offer or exchange offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal is commenced, fail to publicly recommend
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company Stockholders (including, for these purposes, by disclosing
that it is taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company Stockholders, which
shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer; provided that a customary “stop, look
and listen” communication by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d–9(f) under the Exchange Act or a statement that the Company
Board has received and is currently evaluating such Acquisition Proposal shall not be prohibited or be deemed to be a Company Board
Recommendation Change) within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement thereof or such fewer number of days as remain
prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, or (v) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation following any
Acquisition Proposal having been publicly made, proposed or communicated (and not publicly withdrawn) within ten (10) Business
Days after Parent so requests in writing; provided that Parent may not make such request more than one time with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal unless there shall have been an additional public announcement by the Company with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal (each of clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), a “Company Board Recommendation Change”).

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of
the Requisite Stockholder Approval, (1) in connection with an Intervening Event or (2) if the Company Board receives an Acquisition
Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board may (x) in the case of clause (1) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change or (y) in the case of clause (2), effect a Board Recommendation Change and authorize the Company to
terminate this Agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case, if and
only if, prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change and/or authorizing the Company to terminate this Agreement
to concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal:

(i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Massachusetts Law;

(ii) the Company shall have notified Parent in writing at least five (5) Business Days before taking such action of its
intention to do so, and shall have specified the reasons therefor, including (A) if such notice is made in connection with an Intervening
Event, a reasonable description of the Intervening Event and (B) if such notice is made in connection with a Superior Proposal, the
terms and conditions of, and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously with such notice
furnished a copy (if any) of the proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and any other
material transaction documents, including any financing commitment letters (it being understood and agreed that, with respect to any
amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall have provided Parent a new
written notice and a new additional period of three (3) Business Days in respect of each such amendment); it being agreed that any of
the foregoing notice and any amendment to update such notice and the determination to deliver such notice, or update or amend public
disclosure with respect thereto shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement;

(iii) during such five (5) Business Day period or, if applicable, such additional three (3) Business Day period(s), prior
to its effecting a Company Board Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement, if requested by Parent, the Company shall
have made its Representatives available to negotiate with Parent’s Representatives in good faith regarding any revisions to the terms of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent;

(iv) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company a written offer to modify the terms and conditions of this
Agreement during such five (5) Business Day period or, if applicable, such additional three (3) Business Day period(s), the Company
Board, after expiration of the applicable period and after taking into

consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as proposed by Parent, shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that (A) such Superior Proposal continued to be a Superior Proposal,
and that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under Massachusetts Law or (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure to make
a Company Board Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Massachusetts Law; and

(v) in the case of the Company terminating this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal, the Company shall have paid, or caused the payment of, the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.3(b)(iii).

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board and/or any authorized committee thereof from (i) taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (ii) making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders that the
Company Board and/or any committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation from its outside legal counsel) that the
failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Massachusetts Law; provided that any such
disclosure (other than a “stop, look and listen” communication or any substantially similar communication of the type contemplated by
Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change (including for purposes
of Section 8.1(f)) unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms its recommendation to the Company Stockholders in favor of the
approval of this Agreement and the Merger in such disclosure.

6.6 Public Statements and Disclosure. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be a joint press release, the text of
which shall be agreed to by both Parent and the Company. Thereafter, none of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger
Sub, on the other hand, shall issue any public release or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any applicable securities exchange or regulatory or Governmental Authority to which the relevant party is
subject or submits, wherever situated, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance; provided that the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.6 shall not apply to (i) any release or announcement made or proposed
to be made by the Company following a Company Board Recommendation Change or (ii) any filing to be made by a party pursuant to
the Exchange Act.

6.7 Anti-Takeover Laws. In the event that any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall take all action necessary within their
respective control (including, in the case of the Company and the Company Board, grant all necessary approvals) to ensure that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate, or if it is not possible to eliminate, to minimize the effect of such
Takeover Law on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.8 Access. At all times during the period commencing from the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur
of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII and the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, to the properties, assets, books and records, Contracts, facilities and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries;
provided that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a) any
applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information,

(b) access to such documents or information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or other privilege held by the Company or its Subsidiaries and (c) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party otherwise bound would violate or cause a default under, or give a third party the right to terminate or accelerate
the rights under, such Contract; and provided further that no information or knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation
conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
of the Company set forth in this Agreement or otherwise impair the rights and remedies available to Parent and Merger Sub hereunder.
In the event that the Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use its reasonable
best efforts to communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that would not violate any applicable Law, Contract or
obligation or waive such a privilege. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section 6.8 shall be
conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or
create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the terms and conditions of any applicable Lease and the Company’s
reasonable security measures and insurance requirements. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to
any information obtained by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to the access contemplated by this
Section 6.8. Nothing in this Section 6.8 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to require the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Representatives of any of the foregoing to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information.

6.9 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or
officer of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.10 Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all
(i) indemnification agreements set forth on Section 6.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter, and as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, between (A) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former directors and officers as
of the date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of such agreements as in effect on the date hereof and (B) any person who becomes
a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and executes an indemnification agreement
on terms no less favorable to the Company and no more favorable to such person than the current form of indemnification agreement
with its directors and officers that has been made available to Parent (the “Indemnified Persons”) and (ii) indemnification, expense
advancement and exculpation provisions in any Constitutional Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the
date of this Agreement, in each case until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time. In addition, during the period commencing
at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and
other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses, covering acts and omissions of directors and officers, in each case in
their respective capacities as such, occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, that are at least as favorable as the indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and during such six-year period, such provisions
shall not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner adverse to the Indemnified Persons except as required by
applicable Law.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall
purchase a six-year “tail” prepaid policy on the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance (“D&O Insurance”),
provided that the Company shall not pay, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay, annual premiums in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such three hundred
percent (300%) amount, the “Maximum Annual Premium”) (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth
in Section 3.23 of the Company Disclosure Letter). The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) maintain such “tail” policy in full force and effect. The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain such a “tail” policy in full force and effect.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that such
continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such properties or assets, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this Section 6.10.

(d) The obligations set forth in this Section 6.10 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that
adversely affects any Indemnified Person without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person. Each of the

Available to Parent, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity). The obligations and liability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation

(c) To the extent that a Company Plan is made available to any Continuing Employee at or following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) use reasonable best efforts to cause to be granted to
such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation, sick
time or paid time off accrual and severance pay entitlement); provided that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would
result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the extent
commercially reasonable: (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all employee benefit plans sponsored by the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such
plans, collectively, the “New Plans”) to the extent coverage under any such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company
Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the “Old
Plans”); (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits to any
Continuing Employee, the Surviving Corporation shall cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of
insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents to the extent it would have been waived under the comparable Old Plan, and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during any
unfinished portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employee’s participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be given full credit under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall credit the accounts of such
Continuing Employee under any New Plan which is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such
Continuing Employee under the applicable Company Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a Continuing
Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time,
and shall not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture and shall not limit future accruals.

(d) Prior to making any written or oral communications to the Continuing Employees pertaining to compensation or benefits
matters set forth in this Section 6.11, the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication and Parent shall
have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to
(i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate, any
Continuing Employee for any reason, (ii) subject to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this Section 6.11, require
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof
after the Effective Time; or (iii) to constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to any employee benefit or
compensation plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement or otherwise be treated as an amendment or modification of
any Company Plan, New Plan or other benefit plan arrangement. No provision of this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, any beneficiary or dependents thereof, or any
collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and benefits that
may be provided to any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of the
Affiliates or under any benefit plan which any of them may maintain, or otherwise.

Fee, on more than one occasion, whether or not such termination fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement
at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different events.

(e) Liquidated Damages. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that (i) the agreements
contained in this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) each of the Termination Fee
and the Reverse Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and
the Company, respectively, in the circumstances in which such termination fee is payable, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision and (iii) without
these agreements, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due pursuant to in this Article VIII and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company
or Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the non-paying party for the payment of any amount set forth in in this
Article VIII, the non-paying shall pay the other party its costs and expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on such
amount at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum
permitted by applicable Law.

8.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time by execution of an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company; provided that in the event that this Agreement
has been adopted by the Company Stockholders in accordance with Massachusetts Law, no amendment shall be made to this
Agreement that requires the approval or adoption of such Company Stockholders under Massachusetts Law without such approval or
adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise,
except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at
the time of the amendment.

8.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, by action
taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, to the extent legally allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein,
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or parties hereto, as applicable,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or
parties hereto contained herein; provided that after the Requisite Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no waiver may be made that
pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by the Company Stockholders without such further approval or
adoption. Any agreement on the part of a party or parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties, as applicable. Any failure or delay in exercising any right under this
Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder.

Annex B
 
April 7, 2017
 
Board of Directors
Xcerra Corporation
825 University Avenue
Norwood, MA 02062
 
Members of the Board:
 

In your capacity as members of the Board of Directors (the “Board of Directors”) of Xcerra
Corporation (the “Company”), you have requested our opinion (the “Opinion”), as investment bankers,
as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the common stock, par value $0.05
per share, of the Company, other than Acquirer (as defined below) and its affiliates, of the
Consideration (as defined below) to be received by the shareholders of the Company pursuant to the
terms of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), by and among Unic Capital
Management Co., Ltd. (“Acquirer”), China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Co., Ltd.
(“Sponsor”) and the Company.
 
As more specifically set forth in the Agreement, and subject to the terms, conditions and adjustments
set forth in the Agreement, a subsidiary of Acquirer (the “Merger Sub”) will be merged with and into
the Company (the “Transaction”) and each share of common stock of the Company that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the Transaction, other than those shares of common stock of
the Company which are not being converted into the right to receive the Consideration (as defined
below) under the Agreement, will be converted into the right to receive $10.25 per share in cash (the
“Consideration”).
 
Cowen and Company, LLC (“we” or “Cowen”), as part of its investment banking business, is
continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course of our business, we
and our affiliates may actively trade the securities of the Company and/or its or Acquirer’s or
Sponsor’s respective affiliates for our own account and for the accounts of our customers and,
accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities.
 
We are acting as exclusive financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Transaction,
including in connection with the Go-Shop (as defined below), and have received and will receive a fee
from the Company for our services, a significant portion of which is contingent upon the
consummation of the Transaction. We will also receive a fee for providing this Opinion. In addition,
the Company has agreed to reimburse our expenses and indemnify us for certain liabilities that may
arise out of our engagement. In the two years preceding the date of this Opinion, Cowen has not had a
material relationship with the Company or any other party to the Transaction. Cowen and its affiliates
may in the future provide commercial and investment banking services to the Company, Acquirer and
Sponsor and may receive fees for the rendering of such services.

Table of Contents

  

In connection with our Opinion, we have reviewed and considered such financial and other matters as
we have deemed relevant, including, among other things:
 

•     a draft of the Agreement dated April 4, 2017;
 

•     certain publicly available financial and other information for the Company and certain other
relevant financial and operating data furnished to Cowen by the management of the
Company;

 

•     certain internal financial analyses, financial forecasts, reports and other information
concerning the Company prepared by the management of the Company (the “Company
Forecasts”);

  

 

•     discussions we have had with certain members of the management of the Company
concerning the historical and current business operations, financial condition and prospects
of the Company and such other matters we deemed relevant;

 

•     certain operating results of the Company as compared to the operating results of certain
publicly traded companies we deemed relevant;

 

•     the reported price and trading history of the shares of the common stock of the Company as
compared to the reported price and trading histories of certain publicly traded companies we
deemed relevant;

 

•     certain financial terms of the Transaction as compared to the financial terms of certain
selected business combinations we deemed relevant; and

 

•     such other information, financial studies, analyses and investigations and such other factors
that we deemed relevant for the purposes of this Opinion.

 
In conducting our review and arriving at our Opinion, we have, with your consent, assumed and relied,
without independent investigation, upon the accuracy and completeness of all financial and other
information provided to us by the Company or which is publicly available or was otherwise reviewed
by us. We have not undertaken any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or reasonableness of,
or independent verification of, such information. We have relied upon , without independent
verifications, the assessment of the management of the Company as to the existing products and
services of the Company and the viability of, and risks associated with, the future products and
services of the Company. In addition, we have not conducted nor have assumed any obligation to
conduct any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of the Company. We have been requested
to solicit third party indications of interest in the possible acquisition of all or a part of the Company’s
business for a specified period after the date of the Agreement as permitted by the provisions thereof
(the “Go-Shop”). We have further relied upon the Company’s representation that all information
provided to us by the Company is accurate and complete in all material respects. We have, with your
consent, assumed that the Company Forecasts were reasonably prepared by the management of the
Company on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of such
management as to the future performance of the Company, and such Company Forecasts provide a
reasonable basis for our Opinion. We express no opinion as to the Company Forecasts or the
assumptions on which they were made. We expressly disclaim any undertaking or obligation to advise
any person of any change in any fact or matter affecting our Opinion of which we become aware after
the date hereof.

Table of Contents

  

We assumed that there were no material changes in the assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of
operations, business or prospects of the Company since the date of the last financial statements made
available to us. We have not made or obtained any independent evaluations, valuations or appraisals of
the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor have we been furnished with such materials. In addition,
we have not evaluated the solvency or fair value of the Company, Acquirer, Sponsor or Merger Sub
under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Our Opinion does
not address any legal, tax or accounting matters related to the Agreement or the Transaction, as to
which we have assumed that the Company and the Board of Directors of the Company have received
such advice from legal, tax and accounting advisors as each has determined appropriate. Our Opinion
addresses only the fairness of the Consideration, from a financial point of view to the shareholders of
the Company, other than Acquirer and its affiliates. We express no view as to any other aspect or
implication of the Transaction or any other agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into in
connection with the Transaction or otherwise. Our Opinion is necessarily based upon economic and
market conditions and other circumstances as they exist and can be evaluated by us on the date hereof.
It should be understood that although subsequent developments may affect our Opinion, we do not
have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm our Opinion and we expressly disclaim any
responsibility to do so.

  

 
We have not considered any potential legislative or regulatory changes currently being considered or
recently enacted by the United States or any foreign government, or any domestic or foreign
regulatory body, or any changes in accounting methods or generally accepted accounting principles
that may be adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board, or any similar foreign regulatory body or board.
 
For purposes of rendering our Opinion we have assumed in all respects material to our analysis, that
the representations and warranties of each party contained in the Agreement are true and correct, that
each party will perform all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed by it under the
Agreement and that all conditions to the consummation of the Transaction will be satisfied without
waiver thereof. We have assumed that the final form of the Agreement will be substantially similar to
the last draft reviewed by us. We have also assumed that all governmental, regulatory and other
consents and approvals contemplated by the Agreement will be obtained and that in the course of
obtaining any of those consents no restrictions will be imposed or waivers made that would have an
adverse effect on the contemplated benefits of the Transaction. We have assumed that the Transaction
will be consummated in a manner that complies with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all other applicable state or
federal statutes, rules and regulations.
 
It is understood that our Opinion is intended for the benefit and use of the Board of Directors of the
Company in its consideration of the financial terms of the Transaction. Our Opinion should not be
disclosed, referred to, or communicated (in whole or in part) to any third party for any purpose
whatsoever except with our prior written approval. However, our Opinion may be reproduced in full in
disclosure documents relating to the Transaction which the Company is required to file under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our Opinion does not constitute a recommendation to
any shareholder of the Company or any other person as to how to vote with respect to the Transaction
or to take any other action in connection with the

Transaction or otherwise. We have not been requested to opine as to, and our Opinion does not in any
manner address, the Company’s underlying business decision to effect the Transaction or the relative
merits of the Transaction as compared to other business strategies or transactions that might be
available to the Company. In addition, we have not been requested to opine as to, and our Opinion
does not in any manner address, (i) the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of
the Company’s officers, directors or employees, or class of such persons, relative to the compensation
to the public shareholders of the Company or (ii) whether Acquirer or Sponsor has sufficient cash,
available lines of credit or other sources of funds to enable it to pay the Consideration.
 
This Opinion was reviewed and approved by Cowen’s Fairness Opinion Review Committee.
 
Based upon and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions and limitations set forth
herein, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Consideration to be received by the shareholders
of the Company in the Transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to the shareholders of the
Company (other than Acquirer and its affiliates).
 
Very truly yours,

beneficial ownership of those shares for which appraisal rights are asserted was acquired before that date and (B) that the shareholder
did not vote for the transaction;

(2) state:

(i) where the form shall be sent and where certificates for certificated shares shall be deposited and the date by which those certificates
shall be deposited, which date may not be earlier than the date for receiving the required form under subclause (ii);

(ii) a date by which the corporation shall receive the form which date may not be fewer than 40 nor more than 60 days after the date the
subsection (a) appraisal notice and form are sent, and state that the shareholder shall have waived the right to demand appraisal with
respect to the shares unless the form is received by the corporation by such specified date;

(iii) the corporation’s estimate of the fair value of the shares;

sent by the corporation whether the beneficial owner of the shares acquired beneficial ownership of the shares before the date required
to be set forth in the notice pursuant to clause (1) of subsection (b) of section 13.22. If a shareholder fails to make this certification, the
corporation may elect to treat the shareholder’s shares as after-acquired shares under section 13.25. In addition, a shareholder who

certificates in accordance with the terms of the notice by the date referred to in the notice pursuant to subclause (ii) of clause (2) of
subsection (b) of section 13.22. Once a shareholder deposits that shareholder’s certificates or, in the case of uncertificated shares,
returns the executed forms, that shareholder loses all rights as a shareholder, unless the shareholder withdraws pursuant to said
subsection (b).

(b) A shareholder who has complied with subsection (a) may nevertheless decline to exercise appraisal rights and withdraw from the
appraisal process by so notifying the corporation in writing by the date set forth in the appraisal notice pursuant to subclause (v) of
clause (2) of subsection (b) of section 13.22. A shareholder who fails to so withdraw from the appraisal process may not thereafter
withdraw without the corporation’s written consent.

(c) A shareholder who does not execute and return the form and, in the case of certificated shares, deposit that shareholder’s share
certificates where required, each by the date set forth in the notice described in subsection (b) of section 13.22, shall not be entitled to
payment under this chapter.

Section 13.24. PAYMENT

(a) Except as provided in section 13.25, within 30 days after the form required by subclause (ii) of clause (2) of subsection (b) of
section 13.22 is due, the corporation shall pay in cash to those shareholders who complied with subsection (a) of section 13.23 the
amount the corporation estimates to be the fair value of their shares, plus interest.

year ending not more than 16 months before the date of payment, an income statement for that year, a statement of changes in
shareholders’ equity for that year, and the latest available interim financial statements, if any;

(3) a statement that shareholders described in subsection (a) have the right to demand further payment under section 13.26 and that if
any such shareholder does not do so within the time period specified therein, such shareholder shall be deemed to have accepted the
payment in full satisfaction of the corporation’s obligations under this chapter.

Section 13.25. AFTER-ACQUIRED SHARES

(a) A corporation may elect to withhold payment required by section 13.24 from any shareholder who did not certify that beneficial
ownership of all of the shareholder’s shares for which appraisal rights are asserted was acquired before the date set forth in the
appraisal notice sent pursuant to clause (1) of subsection (b) of section 13.22.

(b) If the corporation elected to withhold payment under subsection (a), it must, within 30 days after the form required by subclause
(ii) of clause (2) of subsection (b) of section 13.22 is due, notify all shareholders who are described in subsection (a):

(1) of the information required by clause (1) of subsection (b) of section 13.24;

(2) of the corporation’s estimate of fair value pursuant to clause (2) of subsection (b) of said section 13.24;

(3) that they may accept the corporation’s estimate of fair value, plus interest, in full satisfaction of their demands or demand appraisal
under section 13.26;

(4) that those shareholders who wish to accept the offer shall so notify the corporation of their acceptance of the corporation’s offer
within 30 days after receiving the offer; and

(5) that those shareholders who do not satisfy the requirements for demanding appraisal under section 13.26 shall be deemed to have
accepted the corporation’s offer.

(c) Within 10 days after receiving the shareholder’s acceptance pursuant to subsection(b), the corporation shall pay in cash the amount
it offered under clause (2) of subsection (b) to each shareholder who agreed to accept the corporation’s offer in full satisfaction of the
shareholder’s demand.

(d) Within 40 days after sending the notice described in subsection (b), the corporation must pay in cash the amount if offered to pay
under clause (2) of subsection (b) to each shareholder deserved in clause (5) of subsection (b).

Section 13.26. PROCEDURE IF SHAREHOLDER DISSATISFIED WITH PAYMENT OR OFFER

(a) A shareholder paid pursuant to section 13.24 who is dissatisfied with the amount of the payment shall notify the corporation in
writing of that shareholder’s estimate of the fair value of the shares and demand payment of that estimate plus interest, less any
payment under section 13.24. A shareholder offered payment under section 13.25 who is dissatisfied with that offer shall reject the
offer and demand payment of the shareholder’s stated estimate of the fair value of the shares plus interest.

(b) A shareholder who fails to notify the corporation in writing of that shareholder’s demand to be paid the shareholder’s stated
estimate of the fair value plus interest under subsection (a) within 30 days after receiving the corporation’s payment or offer of
payment under section 13.24 or section 13.25, respectively, waives the right to demand payment under this section and shall be entitled
only to the payment made or offered pursuant to those respective sections.

Section 13.30. COURT ACTION

(a) If a shareholder makes demand for payment under section 13.26 which remains unsettled, the corporation shall commence an
equitable proceeding within 60 days after receiving the payment demand and petition the court to determine the fair value of the shares
and accrued interest. If the corporation does not commence the proceeding within the 60-day period, it shall pay in cash to each
shareholder the amount the shareholder demanded pursuant to section 13.26 plus interest.

(b) The corporation shall commence the proceeding in the appropriate court of the county where the corporation’s principal office, or, if
none, its registered office, in the commonwealth is located. If the corporation is a foreign corporation without a registered office in the
commonwealth, it shall commence the proceeding in the county in the commonwealth where the principal office or registered office of
the domestic corporation merged with the foreign corporation was located at the time of the transaction.

(c) The corporation shall make all shareholders, whether or not residents of the commonwealth, whose demands remain unsettled
parties to the proceeding as an action against their shares, and all parties shall be served with a copy of the petition. Nonresidents may
be served by registered or certified mail or by publication as provided by law or otherwise as ordered by the court.

(d) The jurisdiction of the court in which the proceeding is commenced under subsection (b) is plenary and exclusive. The court may
appoint 1 or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers
shall have the powers described in the order appointing them, or in any amendment to it. The shareholders demanding appraisal rights
are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings.

(e) Each shareholder made a party to the proceeding is entitled to judgment (i) for the amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair
value of the shareholder’ s shares, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by the corporation to the shareholder for such shares or
(ii) for the fair value, plus interest, of the shareholder’s shares for which the corporation elected to withhold payment under section
13.25.

Section 13.31. COURT COSTS AND COUNSEL FEES

(a) The court in an appraisal proceeding commenced under section 13.30 shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the
reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court. The court shall assess the costs against the corporation,
except that the court may assess cost against all or some of the shareholders demanding appraisal, in amounts the court finds equitable,
to the extent the court finds such shareholders acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by
this chapter.

(b) The court in an appraisal proceeding may also assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties, in
amounts the court finds equitable:

(1) against the corporation and in favor of any or all shareholders demanding appraisal if the court finds the corporation did not
substantially comply with the requirements of sections 13.20, 13.22, 13.24 or 13.25; or

(2) against either the corporation or a shareholder demanding appraisal, in favor of any other party, if the court finds that the party
against whom the fees and expenses are assessed acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided
by this chapter.

(c) If the court in an appraisal proceeding finds that the services of counsel for any shareholder were of substantial benefit to other
shareholders similarly situated, and that the fees for those services should not be assessed against the corporation, the court may award
to such counsel reasonable fees to be paid out of the amounts awarded the shareholders who were benefited.

(d) To the extent the corporation fails to make a required payment pursuant to sections 13.24, 13.25, or 13.26, the shareholder may sue
directly for the amount owed and, to the extent successful, shall be entitled to recover from the corporation all costs and expenses of
the suit, including counsel fees.
