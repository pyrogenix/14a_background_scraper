Dear Stockholder:

        You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of the stockholders of Joy Global Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Joy Global," the
"Company," "we," "our" or "us"), which we will hold at 100 E. Wisconsin Avenue, 2nd Floor Conference Room, Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
on October 19, 2016, at 7:30 a.m., local time (such meeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "special meeting").

        At the special meeting, holders of our common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("common stock"), will be asked to consider and vote
on (1) a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the "merger agreement"), dated as
of July 21, 2016, by and among Joy Global, Komatsu America Corp., a Georgia corporation ("Komatsu America"), Pine Solutions Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Komatsu America ("Merger Sub"), and (solely for the purposes specified in the
merger agreement) Komatsu Ltd., a Japanese joint stock company, pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Joy Global,
with Joy Global surviving the merger (the "surviving corporation") as a wholly owned subsidiary of Komatsu America (the "merger"),
(2) a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's
named executive officers in connection with the merger, and (3) a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum.

        If the merger agreement is adopted and the merger is completed, Joy Global will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Komatsu
America and, at the effective time of the merger, each share of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger (other than dissenting shares and shares owned by Joy Global, Komatsu America or any of their respective subsidiaries)
will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive $28.30 per share in cash, without interest, and subject to any applicable
withholding taxes (the "merger consideration").

        The Joy Global board of directors has unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Joy Global and its stockholders and has
unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Joy
Global board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of the Company vote (1) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement, (2) "FOR" the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable
to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger, and (3) "FOR" the proposal to adjourn the special meeting,
if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum.

        The enclosed proxy statement describes the merger agreement, the merger and the compensation that may be paid or become payable
to the named executive officers of Joy Global in connection with the merger and provides specific information concerning the special
meeting and the parties involved. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement. We urge you to, and you
should, read the entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated by reference in the proxy
statement, as it sets forth the details of the merger agreement and other important information related to the merger. In addition, you may
obtain information about us from documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). See "Where You Can Find
Additional Information."

        Your vote is very important. The merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote
your shares of common stock on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        If you have any questions or need assistance in voting your shares, please contact our proxy solicitor, D.F. King & Co., Inc., at toll-
free at (800) 628-8528 or via email at joyglobal@dfking.com.

        Thank you for your continued support.

        Neither the SEC nor any state securities regulatory agency has approved or disapproved the merger, passed upon the merits
or fairness of the merger, the merger agreement or the other transactions contemplated thereby or passed upon the adequacy or
accuracy of the disclosure in this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

        This proxy statement is dated September 2, 2016 and is first being mailed to stockholders on or about September 9, 2016.

  Sincerely,

  

  Edward L. Doheny II
President & Chief Executive Officer

JOY GLOBAL INC.

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS

September 2, 2016

TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS:

        NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that a Special Meeting of the Stockholders of Joy Global Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Joy Global,"
the "Company," "we," "our" or "us"), will be held at 100 E. Wisconsin Avenue, 2nd Floor Conference Room, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at
7:30 a.m., local time, on October 19, 2016 (such meeting, including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "special meeting"), to
consider and vote upon the following proposals:

1. to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 21, 2016 (as it may be amended from time to time, the
"merger agreement"), by and among Joy Global, Komatsu America Corp., a Georgia corporation ("Komatsu America"),
Pine Solutions Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Komatsu America ("Merger Sub"), and
(solely for the purposes specified in the merger agreement) Komatsu Ltd., a Japanese joint stock company, pursuant to
which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Joy Global, with Joy Global surviving the merger (the "surviving
corporation") as a wholly owned subsidiary of Komatsu America (the "merger"); 

2. to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the
Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger; and 

3. to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or in
the absence of a quorum.

        The holders of record of our common stock, par value $1.00 per share ("common stock"), at the close of business on September 1,
2016 (the "record date"), are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting. Attendance at the special meeting will be limited to
Joy Global stockholders as of the close of business on the record date or their authorized representatives, as more fully described under the
section entitled "The Special Meeting—Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting." You must have registered for the special meeting in
accordance with the instructions printed on the proxy card and bring your admission ticket in order to be admitted to the special meeting.

        The Joy Global board of directors has unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders and has unanimously approved the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement.

        The Joy Global board of directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders of the Company vote (1) "FOR" the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (2) "FOR" the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that
may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger, and (3) "FOR" the
proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a
quorum.

        Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of common stock you own. The adoption of the merger agreement by the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting is a condition to
the completion of the



8/16/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/801898/000104746916015233/a2229566zdefm14a.htm

merger. Each of the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named
executive officers of Joy Global in connection with the merger and the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum, requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of
common stock present at the meeting (in person or represented by proxy) and entitled to vote thereon.

        If you hold your shares of record (i.e., your name appears on the registered books of Joy Global), we request that you vote your
shares by proxy, even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person. To vote your shares by proxy, you should complete, sign, date
and return the enclosed proxy in the enclosed postage-paid envelope or submit your proxy by either telephone or on the Internet by
following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card, thereby ensuring that your shares of common stock will be represented at the special
meeting if you are unable to attend. In-person attendance at the special meeting does not by itself constitute a vote.

        If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote on a proposal, your proxy will be voted
(1) "FOR" the adoption of the merger agreement, (2) "FOR" the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that
may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger, and (3) "FOR" the
proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum.

        If you hold your shares in "street name" (i.e., you own your shares beneficially in the name of a stock brokerage account or by a bank,
trust or other nominee), we request that you provide your broker, bank or other nominee with instructions on how you would like them to
vote your shares using the enclosed voting instruction form they provided to you. If a street name holder does not provide timely
instructions, the broker, bank or other nominee will not have the authority to vote on any of the proposals on your behalf. Therefore, unless
you attend the special meeting in person with a properly executed legal proxy obtained from your broker, bank or other nominee, your
failure to provide instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee will result in your shares of Joy Global common stock not being
present at the meeting and not being voted on any of the proposals. Consequently, there cannot be any broker non-votes occurring in
connection with any of the proposals at the special meeting.

        If you fail to vote, the effect will be that your shares of common stock will not be counted for purposes of determining whether
a quorum is present at the special meeting and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the adoption of the merger
agreement, but, assuming a quorum is present, will not affect the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain
compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger
and the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies or in the
absence of a quorum.

        Under Delaware law, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will have the right to seek
appraisal of the fair value of their shares of the Company as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery if the merger is completed, but
only if they submit a written demand for such an appraisal before the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and comply with
the other Delaware law procedures explained in the accompanying proxy statement. See the section entitled "Appraisal Rights."

        You may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote at the special meeting by following the procedures outlined in the
accompanying proxy statement.

        Your vote is very important. The merger cannot be completed unless holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote
your shares of common stock on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

nearly a century. Komatsu Ltd.'s headquarters are located at 2-3-6 Akasaka, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan 107-8414. See the section
entitled "The Companies—Komatsu Ltd."

The Merger (page 26)

        You will be asked to consider and vote upon the proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 21,
2016, by and among Joy Global, Komatsu, Merger Sub and Komatsu Ltd., which, as it may be amended from time to time, is
referred to in this proxy statement as the "merger agreement." A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A. The merger
agreement provides, among other things, that at the effective time of the merger (the "effective time"), Merger Sub will be merged
with and into Joy Global, with Joy Global surviving the merger (the "surviving corporation") as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Komatsu. Upon completion of the merger, Joy Global's common stock will no longer be publicly traded and Joy Global's existing
stockholders will cease to have any ownership interest in Joy Global. Instead, at the effective time, each outstanding share of
common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Joy Global (referred to in this proxy statement as the "common stock," the "Company
common stock" or "Joy Global common stock"), other than shares for which the holders thereof have properly demanded appraisal
under Delaware law (such shares, "dissenting shares") and shares owned by Joy Global, Komatsu or any of their respective
subsidiaries will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.

The Merger Consideration (page 45)

        The merger consideration will be $28.30 per share in cash, without interest, and subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards (page 58)

        Stock Options.    At the effective time, each Joy Global stock option that is outstanding as of the effective time, whether vested
or unvested, will be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive a cash payment (without interest and less applicable
withholding taxes) equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of Joy Global common stock subject to such option as of
immediately prior to the effective time and (b) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price per share of
such option as of immediately prior to the effective time.

        Company Restricted Share Unit Awards and Company Performance Share Awards.    At the effective time, each Joy Global
restricted share unit award that was granted prior to the date of the merger agreement, each Joy Global restricted share unit award
that is held by a non-employee director (whether granted to such director prior to or after the date of the merger agreement), and
each Joy Global performance share award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled in
consideration for the right to receive a cash payment (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of
(1) the number of shares of Joy Global common stock subject to such award as of immediately prior to the effective time and (2) the
merger consideration. For each Joy Global performance share award outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, the number
of shares subject to the applicable award shall be one hundred percent of the "Target Number of Performance Shares" set forth in
the award at the time of grant.

        At the effective time, each Joy Global restricted share unit award granted after the date of the merger agreement (other than any
such award granted to a non-employee director), that is outstanding as of immediately before the effective time will be converted
into a long-term incentive award that entitles the holder to receive a fixed amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the number of
shares of Joy Global common stock underlying such award as of immediately prior to the effective time and (2) the merger
consideration. Each resulting long-term incentive award will be subject to the same

The Special Meeting (page 21)

        The special meeting will be held at 100 E. Wisconsin Avenue, 2nd Floor Conference Room, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on
October 19, 2016, at 7:30 a.m., local time.

Record Date and Quorum (page 22)

        The holders of record of the common stock as of the close of business on September 1, 2016 (the record date for determination
of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting) are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the special
meeting.

        The presence at the special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of record of a majority of the common stock
outstanding at the close of business on the record date will constitute a quorum, permitting the Company to conduct its business at
the special meeting.

Required Vote (page 22)

        Each share of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date is entitled to one vote at the special
meeting on each matter properly brought before the special meeting.

        For the Company to complete the merger, stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding at the
close of business on the record date must vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of
common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        Approval of each of the adjournment proposal and the advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that may be
paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote
thereon. An abstention will have the same effect as a vote against these proposals, but the failure to vote your shares will have no
effect on the outcome of these proposals.

Conditions to Completion of the Merger (page 72)

        Each party's obligation to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:

• the adoption of the merger agreement by the requisite Joy Global stockholder vote; 

• no injunction by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction having been entered and continuing to be in
effect and no law continuing to be in effect, in each case that prevents, makes illegal or prohibits the consummation
of the merger; and 

• all required statutory approvals, including the expiration or termination of any waiting period applicable to the
merger under the HSR Act, having been obtained at or prior to the effective time.

        The respective obligations of Komatsu and Merger Sub to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver (in
writing) of the following additional conditions:

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Joy Global both at and as of July 21, 2016 and at and as of the
effective time (except for any such representations and warranties made as of a particular date or period, which
representations and warranties must be true and correct only as of that date or period), in most cases, without giving
effect to any materiality limitation

set forth therein but subject to a "material adverse effect" or other materiality standard provided in the merger
agreement;

• Joy Global having performed and complied in all material respects with each covenant required by the merger
agreement to be performed or complied with by it prior to the closing; 

• Komatsu's receipt of a certificate signed on behalf of Joy Global by an executive officer of Joy Global to the effect
that each of the conditions described in the two preceding bullet points have been satisfied; and 

• The absence of any fact, circumstance, effect, change, event or development occurring after July 21, 2016 that has
had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a company material adverse effect, as
defined in the merger agreement.

        The obligation of Joy Global to complete the merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver (in writing) of the following
additional conditions:

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Komatsu and Merger Sub both at and as of July 21, 2016 and at
and as of the effective time (except for any such representations and warranties made as of a particular date or
period, which representations and warranties must be true and correct only as of that date or period), in most cases,
without giving effect to any materiality limitation set forth therein but subject to a "material adverse effect" standard
provided in the merger agreement; 

• each of Komatsu and Merger Sub having performed and complied in all material respects with each covenant
required by the merger agreement to be performed or complied with by it prior to the closing; and 

• Joy Global's receipt of a certificate signed on behalf of Komatsu by an executive officer of Komatsu to the effect that
each of the conditions described in the two preceding bullet points have been satisfied.

When the Merger Becomes Effective (page 58)

        The completion of the merger is subject to the adoption of the merger agreement by Joy Global's stockholders and the
satisfaction of the other closing conditions.

        As of the date of the filing of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the merger in mid-2017. The merger is subject to
various regulatory clearances and approvals and other conditions, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Joy Global or
Komatsu could result in the merger being completed at a later time, or not at all. There may be a substantial amount of time between
the special meeting and the completion of the merger. We expect to complete the merger promptly following the receipt of all
required approvals.

Recommendation of the Joy Global Board of Directors (page 34)

        After careful consideration, the Joy Global board of directors (the "Joy Global board") unanimously approved the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The Joy Global board of directors
unanimously recommends that Joy Global stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement at the
special meeting.

Reasons for the Merger (page 34)

        For a description of the reasons considered by the Joy Global board in deciding to recommend adoption of the merger
agreement, see the sections entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Reasons for the Merger" and "The Merger (Proposal 1)—
Recommendation of the Joy Global Board of Directors."

Opinion of Joy Global's Financial Advisor (page B-1)

Goldman, Sachs & Co.

        In connection with the merger, Joy Global's financial advisor, Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("Goldman Sachs"), delivered its written
opinion, dated July 21, 2016, to the Joy Global board, to the effect that, as of July 21, 2016 and based upon and subject to the
factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $28.30 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock to be paid to holders (other than
Komatsu Ltd. and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of Joy Global common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair
from a financial point of view to such holders.

        The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated July 21, 2016, which sets forth assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is
attached as Annex B to this proxy statement. The summary of the Goldman Sachs opinion contained in this proxy statement
is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs' written opinion. Goldman Sachs' advisory services
and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of the Joy Global board in connection with its consideration
of the merger, and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Joy Global's common stock
should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter. Pursuant to an engagement letter between Joy Global and
Goldman Sachs, Joy Global has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee of approximately $28.5 million, all of which
is contingent upon consummation of the merger. In the event the merger agreement is terminated prior to consummation of
the merger or the merger is not otherwise consummated, the engagement letter between Joy Global and Goldman Sachs
provides for a payment to Goldman Sachs equal to the lesser of the transaction fee that would have been payable to
Goldman Sachs (approximately $28.5 million) and 30% of any payment or other consideration Joy Global receives pursuant
to the terms of the merger agreement related to such termination or non-consummation.

        For further information, see the sections entitled "The Merger—Opinion of Joy Global's Financial Advisor—Opinion of
Goldman Sachs" and Annex B.

Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (page 48)

        In considering the recommendation of the Joy Global board with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that
some of Joy Global's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the
interests of Joy Global's stockholders generally. Interests of officers and directors that may be different from or in addition to the
interests of Joy Global's stockholders include, among others, treatment of the outstanding Joy Global equity awards pursuant to the
merger agreement, potential severance benefits and other payments and rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage.
The Joy Global board was aware of these different or additional interests and considered such interests along with other matters in
approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. These interests are discussed in
more detail in the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger."

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (page 53)

        If you are a U.S. holder (as defined under "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger"), the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Joy Global common stock pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular tax
consequences to you of the exchange of shares of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger in light of your particular
circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws). For a more detailed
discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the

merger to Joy Global stockholders, please see the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger."

Regulatory Approvals (page 55)

        HSR Clearance.    Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until
notifications have been given and information furnished to the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of
the United States Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied
or terminated. Completion of the merger is subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR
Act. In accordance with the merger agreement, both Joy Global and Komatsu will file, as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the date of the merger agreement, their respective Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the Antitrust Division.

        Other Clearances.    Completion of the merger is further subject to certain regulatory processes, including the receipt of
antitrust clearance and/or approval or the filing of notices in Austria, Australia, Botswana, Brazil, Canada, China, Chile, Colombia,
the European Commission, in case of referral, Poland, Russia, South Africa and Sweden.

        Commitments to Obtain Approvals.    Joy Global and Komatsu must, if necessary to obtain certain agreed antitrust approvals,
(1) defend through litigation any claim asserted in any court that could impede the closing, but only through the completion of a
preliminary or permanent injunction hearing in the U.S., and, in other jurisdictions, only until the time that continuing to do so
would no longer be reasonably likely to lead to the antitrust approvals or clearances being obtained, subject to certain limitations
specified in the merger agreement, and (2) divest, license or otherwise dispose of any of Joy Global's assets, product lines or
businesses, or agree to any conduct restrictions, that produced or represent revenues in the aggregate not exceeding $600 million.
Komatsu is not required (a) to sell, divest or hold separate any of Komatsu's or its affiliates' assets or business (as opposed to Joy
Global's assets and business) or (b) to divest or agree to use limitations on the intellectual property in the SR Drive Technology,
unless permitted to retain ownership of, or a worldwide royalty-free, unrestricted license to the SR Drive Technology. SR Drive
Technology refers to the structure or methods of using or manufacturing any drive system making use of a switched reluctance
motor, as well as all hardware and software components and intellectual property necessary to use the system in operation in heavy
equipment, including but not limited to kinetic energy storage, controller, power source, power conversion and braking components.
See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Approvals."

        For purposes of the regulatory approvals provisions in the merger agreement, the calculation of revenues for any asset, product,
line of business, or conduct restriction of Joy Global will be made on the basis of revenues reflected in the audited Joy Global
consolidated accounts as of October 30, 2015. In the case of conduct restrictions on Komatsu and its affiliates, the calculation of
revenues will be made on the basis of the revenues of Komatsu's parent company, Komatsu Ltd., as reflected in the audited
Komatsu Ltd. consolidated accounts as of March 31, 2016.

Appraisal Rights (page 83)

        Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Joy Global stockholders who do not vote for the
adoption of the merger agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares in cash as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, but only if they comply fully with all of the applicable requirements of the DGCL, which are
summarized in this proxy statement. Any appraisal amount determined by the court could be more than, the same as, or less than the
value of the merger consideration. Any stockholder intending to exercise appraisal rights must, among other things, submit a written
demand for appraisal to the

Table of Contents

Company before the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement and must not vote or otherwise submit a proxy in favor of
adoption of the merger agreement. Failure to follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of
appraisal rights. Because of the complexity of the DGCL relating to appraisal rights, if you are considering exercising your
appraisal rights, we encourage you to seek the advice of your own legal counsel. The discussion of appraisal rights contained in this
proxy statement is not a full summary of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the
full text of Section 262 of the DGCL that is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C.

No Solicitation; Alternative Proposals (page 66)

        While the merger is pending, Joy Global, its affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, principals, partners,
managers, members, attorneys, accountants, agents, employees, consultants, financial advisors or other authorized representatives
(collectively, "representatives"), have agreed to:

• not, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any "company takeover
proposal," as described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Alternative Proposals; No Solicitation," or
any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a company takeover proposal; 

• not, directly or indirectly, participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person
(other than Komatsu and its affiliates and its and their respective representatives) any nonpublic information with
respect to, or cooperate in any way with any such person with respect to, any company takeover proposal or any
inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a company takeover proposal; and 

• immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Komatsu
and its affiliates and its and their respective representatives) that may be ongoing with respect to a company takeover
proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a company takeover proposal,
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously provided to such persons and
terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such person or its representatives.

        However, if at any time after July 21, 2016 and prior to obtaining the required vote of the Company's stockholders to adopt the
merger agreement, Joy Global receives a bona fide, unsolicited written company takeover proposal from any third party (that did
not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement), and if the Joy Global board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such company takeover proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a "superior company proposal," as described in the section entitled "The
Merger Agreement—Alternative Proposals; No Solicitation—Receipt of Company Takeover Proposals," Joy Global may:

• furnish, pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, information (including non-public information) with
respect to Joy Global and its subsidiaries to the person that has made such company takeover proposal and its
representatives; provided that Joy Global must substantially concurrently provide to Komatsu any non-public
information concerning Joy Global or any of its subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its
representatives, unless such non-public information has been previously provided to Komatsu; and 

• participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such company takeover proposal and its
representatives regarding such proposal;

but in each case described in the two preceding bullet points, only if (A) the Joy Global board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to take such action could reasonably likely be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law and (B) Joy Global shall have delivered to Komatsu a
prior written notice advising Komatsu that it intends to take such action.

        If, at any time prior to obtaining the required vote of the Company's stockholders to adopt the merger agreement, the Joy
Global board determines in good faith, after consultation with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that a
written company takeover proposal that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provision of the merger agreement
constitutes a superior company proposal, then the Joy Global board may terminate the merger agreement with Komatsu, provided
that (1) Joy Global must have given Komatsu at least three business days prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and
have provided Komatsu the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making, any such superior company
proposal, (2) if requested by Komatsu, Joy Global must have negotiated with Komatsu in good faith regarding any revision to the
merger agreement committed to in writing by Komatsu, and (3) at the end of such notice period, the Joy Global board must have
considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of the merger agreement proposed in writing by Komatsu, and have determined,
after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that after taking into account any revisions to
the merger agreement proposed by Komatsu, the failure to terminate the merger agreement as a result of such superior company
proposal would reasonably likely be inconsistent with the Joy Global board's fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        The non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement do not prohibit Joy Global or the Joy Global board taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of Joy Global a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making any disclosure to the stockholders of Joy Global if the Joy Global board determines in good faith that
failure to so disclose would reasonably likely be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law.

Changes in Board Recommendation (page 68)

        The Joy Global board has unanimously recommended that Joy Global stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement. The merger agreement permits the Joy Global board to make a "company adverse recommendation change" in
the event that (i) a company intervening event occurs or (ii) Joy Global receives a superior company proposal that does not result
from a breach of the non-solicitation requirement, and, in each case, if the Joy Global board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor and after taking into account any changes to the terms of the merger
agreement proposed by Komatsu during the three business day period referred to in clause (3) below) that the failure to effect a
company adverse recommendation change would reasonably likely be inconsistent with the Joy Global board's fiduciary duties
under applicable law.

        In addition, to make a change of recommendation, the Joy Global board must (1) provide three business days prior written
notice to Komatsu that it is prepared to effect a company adverse recommendation change, which notice shall identify the company
intervening event or describe the material terms and conditions of the superior company proposal; (2) if requested by Komatsu,
during the three business day period after delivery of the notice, negotiate in good faith with Komatsu and its representatives
regarding any revisions to the merger agreement committed to in writing by Komatsu and (3) at the end of such three business day
period and taking into account any changes to the terms of the merger agreement committed to in writing by Komatsu, determine in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to make such a company adverse
recommendation change would reasonably likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law.

• the merger has not been completed by 5:00 p.m. New York City time on July 21, 2017 (referred to in this
proxy statement as the "end date"), provided that if all of the conditions to closing, other than those
pertaining to legal restraints under antitrust laws, waiting periods under the HSR Act or receipt of all
required statutory approvals, have been satisfied or waived at such time, the end date may be extended by
either Joy Global or Komatsu by a total of two three-month periods by written notice to the other party prior
to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the then-applicable end date, as further described below under "The
Merger Agreement—Termination"; or 

• an order by a governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has been issued (1) in respect of any antitrust
law of the United States, preliminarily or permanently enjoining the consummation of the merger, (2) in
respect of any other antitrust law, if continuing to pursue approvals would no longer reasonably likely permit
the antitrust approvals to be obtained, or (3) in respect of any other legal restraint, the legal restraint has
become final and nonappealable, subject to certain limited consultation rights, as further described below
under "The Merger Agreement—Termination"; or 

• if the required vote of Joy Global's stockholders to adopt the merger agreement has not been obtained at the
Joy Global stockholders meeting or at any adjournment or postponement of the Joy Global stockholders
meeting; or 

• by Joy Global, if: 

• Komatsu or Merger Sub has breached or there is any inaccuracy in any of its representations or warranties, or
has breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements contained in the merger
agreement, which would result in a failure of a condition to the obligations of Joy Global to effect the
merger, subject to a cure period, as further described below under "The Merger Agreement—Termination"; or

• at any time prior to obtaining the required vote of Joy Global's stockholders to adopt the merger agreement,
in accordance with the provisions relating to Joy Global's right to terminate the merger agreement to enter
into a superior company proposal, Joy Global enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior
company proposal; or 

• by Komatsu, if: 

• Joy Global has breached or there is any inaccuracy in any of its representations or warranties, or has
breached or failed to perform any of its covenants or other agreements contained in the merger agreement

Merger Sub to effect the merger, subject to a cure period, as further described below under "The Merger
Agreement—Termination"; or

Termination Fee (page 74)

Company Termination Fee

        Joy Global will pay Komatsu a termination fee in an amount equal to $75 million in cash if the merger agreement is terminated

• if the merger agreement is terminated by either Joy Global or Komatsu due to Joy Global having entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to a superior company proposal, as set forth in the merger agreement; or 

• if the merger agreement is terminated by Komatsu because the Joy Global board makes or publicly announces its
intention to make a company adverse recommendation change; or 

• if the merger agreement is terminated (a) by either party because Joy Global's stockholders vote not to adopt the
merger agreement, (b) by either party because the merger was not completed before the end date or (c) by Komatsu
because of a material breach by Joy Global of its non-solicitation obligations or if the Joy Global board fails to
reaffirm its recommendation after a request from Komatsu in certain circumstances, and, in each case, (i) prior to
any termination a third party makes a company takeover proposal that is publicly announced and not withdrawn,
(ii) within 315 days of termination, Joy Global enters into a definitive agreement providing for, or completes, any
company takeover proposal and (iii) at the time of termination there are no legal restraints relating to antitrust law
and the antitrust-related closing conditions were reasonably expected to be satisfied prior to the end date.

Parent Termination Fee

        Komatsu will pay Joy Global a termination fee in an amount equal to $150 million in immediately available funds if the
merger agreement is terminated in the following circumstances:

• if either Komatsu or Joy Global terminates the merger agreement because the merger was not completed before the
end date and, at the time of the termination, the required regulatory approvals have not been received (and all other
conditions to closing are satisfied), or because the transaction is enjoined in connection with any required regulatory
approval; or 

• if the merger agreement is terminated by Joy Global because Komatsu has breached certain of its covenants and
obligations under the merger agreement relating to seeking to obtain the required regulatory approvals and such
breach results or would be reasonably likely to result in the failure of the antitrust-related closing conditions to be
satisfied.

Delisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock (page 56)

Certain Litigation Relating to the Merger (page 56) 

        Several purported class action complaints relating to the merger have been filed in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Wisconsin on behalf of putative classes of Joy Global's public shareholders (the "federal cases"). The complaints
name as defendants Joy Global and its directors, and one of the complaints (Soffer) also names Komatsu America and Merger Sub.
The federal cases generally allege that Joy Global and its directors breached federal securities laws by failing to disclose material
information in the preliminary form of this proxy statement. The Soffer complaint also alleges that Joy Global's directors violated
their fiduciary duties by entering into the merger agreement after engaging in an unfair process resulting in an unfair price, by
improperly seeking to benefit themselves, and by agreeing to certain "deal protection" terms in the merger agreement. The Soffer
complaint alleges that Joy Global, Komatsu America and Merger Sub aided and abetted these alleged violations of fiduciary duties.
The federal cases are: Oduntan v. Joy Global Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 16-cv-1136, filed August 24, 2016; Soffer v. Doheny, et
al., Civil Action No. 16-cv-1148, filed August 26, 2016; and Gordon v. Joy Global Inc., et al., Case No. 16-cv-1153, filed
August 26, 2016. Also on August 26, 2106, a putative class action, Garfield v. Joy Global Inc., et al., 16CV006588, was filed in the
Circuit Court of Wisconsin, Milwaukee County, naming Joy Global, its directors, Komatsu America, Komatsu Ltd., Goldman Sachs
and unnamed Goldman Sachs employees (the "state case"). The state case alleges that the individual defendants breached their
fiduciary duties by entering into the merger agreement and further that Joy Global and the individual defendants have failed to
disclose material terms concerning the merger. The complaint alleges that Komatsu America, Komatsu Ltd. and the Goldman Sachs
defendants aided and abetted the individual defendants' alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. Each of the federal cases and the state
case seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger, damages and an award of plaintiff's
expenses and attorneys' fees. Defendants believe that the claims respectively asserted against them are without merit.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE MERGER 

        The following questions and answers address briefly some questions you may have regarding the special meeting and the proposals to
be voted on at the special meeting. These questions and answers may not address all of the questions that may be important to you as a
stockholder of Joy Global. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this
proxy statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, which you should read carefully and in
their entirety. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference into this proxy statement without charge by following the
instructions under the section entitled "Where You Can Find Additional Information."

Q:    Why am I receiving this proxy statement?

A: On July 21, 2016, Joy Global entered into a definitive agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Komatsu, with and into Joy Global, with Joy Global surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Komatsu.
You are receiving this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Joy Global board in favor of the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement and to approve the other related proposals to be voted on at the special meeting.

Q:    When and where is the special meeting?

A: The special meeting will be held at 100 E. Wisconsin Avenue, 2nd Floor Conference Room, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at 7:30 a.m.,
local time, on October 19, 2016 (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "special meeting").

Q:    Who is entitled to vote at the special meeting?

A: Only holders of record of Joy Global common stock as of the close of business on September 1, 2016, the record date for the
special meeting, are entitled to receive these proxy materials and to vote their shares at the special meeting. As of the close of
business on the record date, there were 98,162,806 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting,
held by 108 holders of record. Each share of Joy Global common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date will be entitled
to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at the special meeting.

Q:    What matters will be voted on at the special meeting?

A: You will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals: 

• to adopt the merger agreement; 

• to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named
executive officers of Joy Global in connection with the merger; and 

• to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or in
the absence of a quorum.

Q:    How do I attend the special meeting?

Table of Contents

Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202 the name of your representative, in addition to your admission ticket if you are a stockholder of
record, or your proof of ownership if you are a beneficial owner, and the address where the admission ticket should be sent. Proof
of ownership would be a bank or brokerage account statement in your name showing the number of shares of Joy Global common
stock held by you on the record date or a letter from your broker, bank or other nominee certifying the amount of your beneficial
ownership interest as of the close of business on the record date. Please submit your request promptly in order for it to be received
in a timely manner. A stockholder may only appoint one representative. Requests from stockholders that are legal entities must be
signed by an authorized officer or other person legally authorized to act on behalf of the legal entity.

Q:    How many shares are needed to constitute a quorum?

A: A quorum will be present if holders of record of a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding on the close of business on
the record date are present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting. If a quorum is not present at the special
meeting, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is obtained.

As of September 1, 2016, the record date for the special meeting, there were 98,162,806 shares of common stock outstanding.
Therefore, the required quorum for the meeting will be 49,081,404 shares of common stock.

If you submit a proxy but fail to provide voting instructions or abstain on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your shares
will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting.

If your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct the nominee how to vote
your shares, your broker, bank or other nominee will not vote on your behalf with respect to any of the proposals, and your shares
will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the special meeting.

Q:    What vote of Joy Global stockholders is required to adopt the merger agreement?

A: Adoption of the merger agreement requires that stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding at the
close of business on the record date for the special meeting vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Because as of
September 1, 2016, the record date for the special meeting, there were 98,162,806 shares of common stock outstanding,
49,081,404 shares of common stock voting in favor of the proposal will be required to adopt the merger agreement. A failure to
vote your shares of common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement. If your shares are held in "street name" by your broker, bank or other nominee and you do not instruct
the nominee how to vote your shares, such failure to instruct your nominee will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. 

Q: What vote of Joy Global stockholders is required to approve the other proposals to be voted upon at the special meeting? 

A: Approval of each of the adjournment proposal and the advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that may be paid
or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote
thereon. An abstention will have the same effect as a vote against these proposals, but the failure to vote your shares will have no
effect on the outcome of these proposals.

Table of Contents

Any shares present and not voted, whether by broker non-vote, abstention or otherwise, will have no effect on these proposals. If
you hold your shares in "street name," your broker or other nominee will not have discretionary authority to vote your shares if you
do not provide instructions as to how your shares should be voted on this proposal.

Q:    How does the Joy Global board recommend that I vote?

A: The Joy Global board unanimously recommends that Joy Global stockholders vote 

• "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; 

• "FOR" the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable
to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger; and 

• "FOR" the proposal regarding adjournment of the special meeting.

For a discussion of the factors that the Joy Global board considered in determining to recommend the adoption of the merger
agreement, please see the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Reasons for the Merger." In addition, in considering the
recommendation of the Joy Global board with respect to the merger agreement, you should be aware that some of our directors and
executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Joy Global stockholders generally.
For a discussion of these interests, please see the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of the Company's Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger."

Q:    How do Joy Global's directors and officers intend to vote?

A: We currently expect that the Company's directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting.

Q:    When is the merger expected to be completed?

A: As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the merger in mid-2017. However, completion of the merger is
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the merger, which are described in this proxy statement
and include various regulatory clearances and approvals, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Joy Global or
Komatsu could delay the completion of the merger, or prevent it from being completed at all. There may be a substantial amount of
time between the special meeting and the completion of the merger. We expect to complete the merger promptly following the
receipt of all required approvals.

Q:    What happens if the merger is not completed?

A: If the merger agreement is not adopted by Joy Global's stockholders, or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, Joy
Global's stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of common stock in connection with the merger. Instead, Joy
Global will remain a public company, and shares of our common stock will continue to be registered under the Exchange Act, as
well as listed and traded on the NYSE. In the event that either Joy Global or Komatsu terminates the merger agreement, then, in
certain circumstances, Joy Global will pay Komatsu a termination fee in an amount equal to $75 million. In other circumstances,
Komatsu will pay to Joy Global a termination fee in an amount equal to $150 million. See the section entitled "The Merger
Agreement—Termination—Termination Fee."

Q: What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to Joy Global stockholders? 

A: If you are a U.S. holder (as defined under "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger"), the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of Joy Global common stock pursuant to the merger will generally be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular tax
consequences to you of the exchange of shares of common stock for cash pursuant to the merger in light of your particular
circumstances (including the application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws). For a more detailed
discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to Joy Global stockholders, please see the section
entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger." 

Q: What will happen if stockholders do not approve the advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that may be
paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger? 

A: The inclusion of this proposal is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules; however, the approval of this
proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger and the vote on this proposal is an advisory vote by stockholders and
will not be binding on the Company or Komatsu. If the merger agreement is adopted by the Company's stockholders and the
merger is completed, the merger-related compensation will be paid to the Company's named executive officers in accordance with
the terms of their compensation agreements and arrangements even if stockholders fail to approve this proposal.

Q:    What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of common stock?

A: We urge you to, and you should, read this entire proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents incorporated
by reference in this proxy statement, and to consider how the merger affects you. Your vote is important, regardless of the number
of shares of common stock you own.

Voting in Person

Stockholders of record will be able to vote in person at the special meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record but instead hold
your shares of common stock in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide a legal proxy executed
in your favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the special meeting.

It is not necessary to attend the special meeting in order to vote your shares. To ensure that your shares of common stock are voted
at the special meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the
special meeting in person.

Attending the meeting in person does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.

Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder

You can also ensure that your shares are voted at the special meeting by submitting your proxy via:

• mail, by completing, signing and dating the enclosed proxy card and returning it in the enclosed postage-paid envelope; 

• telephone, by using the toll-free number listed on each proxy card; or 

• the Internet, at the Internet address provided on each proxy card.

Table of Contents

If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote with respect to a proposal, your proxy will be
voted "FOR" (1) the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (2) the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain
compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger,
and (3) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or in the absence of a
quorum.

We encourage you to vote by proxy even if you plan on attending the special meeting.

A failure to vote or an abstention will have the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. An
abstention will have the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the other two proposals, but assuming a quorum is present, a failure to
vote will have no effect on the other two proposals.

Shares of Common Stock Held in "Street Name"

If you hold your shares in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the directions provided by
your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares. Without
those instructions, your shares will not be voted on any of the proposals, which will have the same effect as voting "AGAINST"
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and no effect on the other two proposals.

Q:    Can I revoke my proxy?

A: Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you
may revoke your proxy by notifying the Company's Secretary in writing to the Company in care of the Secretary at Joy
Global Inc., 100 E. Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 2780, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202, or by submitting a new proxy by telephone, the
Internet or mail, in each case, in accordance with the instructions on the enclosed proxy card and dated after the date of the proxy
being revoked. In addition, you may revoke your proxy by attending the special meeting and voting in person; however, simply
attending the special meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked. Please note that if you hold your shares in "street name" and
you have instructed a broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares, you should instead follow the instructions received from
your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke your prior voting instructions. If you hold your shares in "street name," you may also
revoke a prior proxy by voting in person at the special meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor from your broker, bank
or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the special meeting.

Q:    What happens if I do not vote or if I abstain from voting on the proposals?

A: The requisite number of shares to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement is based on the total number of shares of
common stock outstanding on the record date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do not vote or abstain from voting on the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement.

The requisite number of shares to approve the other two proposals is based on the total number of shares represented in person or
represented by proxy with respect to such proposals. If you do not vote, such failure to vote will have no effect on the advisory
(non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the
Company in connection with the merger and the proposal regarding adjournment of the special meeting; if you abstain from voting
with respect to such proposals, such abstention will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" such proposals.

Table of Contents

Q: Will my shares of common stock held in "street name" or another form of record ownership be combined for voting
purposes with shares I hold of record? 

A: No. Because any shares of common stock you may hold in "street name" will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder (that
is, your custodial bank, broker or other financial nominee) than any shares of common stock you hold of record, any shares of
common stock held in "street name" will not be combined for voting purposes with shares of common stock you hold of record.
Similarly, if you own shares of common stock in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or
as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for those shares of common stock
because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares of common stock held by a corporation or business entity
must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Please indicate title or authority when completing and signing the proxy card.
Shares of common stock held in an individual retirement account must be voted under the rules governing the account. This means
that, to ensure all your shares are voted at the special meeting, you should read carefully any proxy materials received and follow
the instructions included therewith.

Q:    What does it mean if I get more than one proxy card or voting instruction card?

A: If your shares of common stock are registered differently or are held in more than one account, you will receive more than one
proxy or voting instruction card. Please complete and return all of the proxy cards and voting instruction cards you receive (or
submit each of your proxies by telephone or the Internet, if available to you) to ensure that all of your shares of common stock are
voted.

Q:    What happens if I sell my shares of common stock before completion of the merger?

A: In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares of common stock through completion of the merger.
Consequently, if you transfer your shares of common stock before completion of the merger, you will have transferred your right to
receive the merger consideration in the merger.

The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the consummation of the merger. If you
transfer your shares of common stock after the record date but before the closing of the merger, you will have the right to vote at
the special meeting but not the right to receive the merger consideration.

Q:    Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?

A: No. After the merger is completed, you will receive a letter of transmittal and related materials from the paying agent for the
merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock evidenced by stock certificates for the
merger consideration. If your shares of common stock are held in "street name" by your broker, bank or other nominee, you may
receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to effect the surrender of
your "street name" shares in exchange for the merger consideration. Do not send in your certificates now.

Q:    What is householding and how does it affect me?

A: The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more stockholders reside,
unless contrary instructions have been received, but only if the company provides advance notice and follows certain procedures.
In such cases, each stockholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may
have instituted householding for beneficial owners of common stock held through brokerage firms.

decide at any time to revoke your decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.

Information."

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

        This proxy statement, and the documents incorporated by reference in this proxy statement, includes "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include any statement that is not
based on historical fact, including statements containing the words "believe," "may," "could," "would," "might," "possible," "will,"
"should," "expect," "intend," "plan," "anticipate" or "continue," and similar expressions. The Company intends that such forward-looking
statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding
important risk factors and should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein
will be achieved. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as
required by law. In addition to other factors and matters contained in or incorporated by reference in this document, we believe the
following factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements:

• the failure to obtain the required vote of the Company's stockholders to adopt the merger agreement; 

• the possibility that the closing conditions to the contemplated transactions may not be satisfied or waived, including that a
governmental entity may prohibit, delay or refuse to grant a necessary regulatory approval; 

• delay in closing the transaction or the possibility of non-consummation of the transaction; 

• the potential for regulatory authorities to require divestitures or other remedies in connection with the proposed transaction;

• the occurrence of any event that could give rise to termination of the merger agreement; 

• the risk that stockholder litigation in connection with the contemplated transactions may affect the timing or occurrence of
the contemplated transactions or result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability; 

• risks inherent in the achievement of cost synergies and the timing thereof; 

• risks related to the disruption of the transaction to the Company and its management; 

• limitations placed on the Company's ability to operate its business under the merger agreement; 

• the effect of announcement of the transaction on the Company's ability to retain and hire key personnel and maintain
relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties; 

• fluctuations in the availability and prices of commodities; 

• difficult global economic and capital markets conditions; 

• risks associated with revenues from foreign markets; 

• interruption, failure or compromise of the Company's information systems; 

• changes in the legal and regulatory environment;

and other risks detailed in our filings with the SEC, including the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended October 30, 2015, and in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other documents filed by Joy Global with the SEC
after the date thereof. See the section entitled "Where You Can Find Additional Information."

        Many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict. In light of the significant
uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements contained herein, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We cannot guarantee any future results, levels of activity, performance or
achievements.

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

        We are furnishing this proxy statement to the Company's stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Joy Global board for
use at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. This proxy statement provides the Company's stockholders with
the information they need to know to be able to vote or instruct their vote to be cast at the special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting 

        This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by the Joy Global board for use at the
special meeting to be held at 100 E. Wisconsin Avenue, 2nd Floor Conference Room, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on October 19, 2016, at
7:30 a.m. local time, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

        You must have registered for the special meeting in accordance with the instructions printed on the proxy card and bring your
admission ticket in order to be admitted to the special meeting. If you wish to appoint a representative to attend the special meeting in your
place, you must provide to the Company in care of the Secretary at Joy Global Inc., 100 E. Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 2780, Milwaukee,
Wisconsin 53202, the name of your representative, in addition to your admission ticket if you are a stockholder of record, or your proof of
ownership if you are a beneficial owner, and the address where the admission ticket should be sent. Proof of ownership would be a bank or
brokerage account statement in your name showing the number of shares of Joy Global common stock held by you on the record date or a
letter from your broker, bank or other nominee certifying the amount of your beneficial ownership interest as of the close of business on
the record date. Please submit your request promptly in order for it to be received in a timely manner. A stockholder may only appoint one
representative. Requests from stockholders that are legal entities must be signed by an authorized officer or other person legally authorized
to act on behalf of the legal entity.

Purposes of the Special Meeting 

        At the special meeting, Joy Global stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:

• to adopt the merger agreement, dated as of July 21, 2016, by and among Joy Global, Komatsu, Merger Sub, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Komatsu, and (solely for the purposes specified in the merger agreement) Komatsu Ltd., a Japanese
joint stock company; and 

• to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the
Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger, the value of which is disclosed in the table in the
section of this proxy statement entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger"; and 

• to approve the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or in
the absence of a quorum.

        Our stockholders must adopt the merger agreement for the merger to occur. If our stockholders fail to adopt the merger agreement, the
merger will not occur. A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A, and the material provisions of the
merger agreement are described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement."

        The vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the merger is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the
merger agreement. Accordingly, a stockholder may vote to approve

the executive compensation and vote not to adopt the merger agreement and vice versa. Because the vote on executive compensation is
advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either the Company or Komatsu. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by the
Company's stockholders and the merger is completed, the merger-related compensation may be paid to the Company's executive officers
even if the stockholders fail to approve the proposal.

        Joy Global does not expect a vote to be taken on any other matters at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof. If any other matters are properly presented at the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof for consideration,
however, the holders of the proxies will have discretion to vote on these matters in accordance with their best judgment.

        This proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy are first being mailed to our stockholders on or about September 9, 2016.

Record Date, Shares Outstanding and Quorum 

        Shareholders of record of our common stock, par value $1.00 per share, at the close of business on September 1, 2016 may vote on all
matters presented at the special meeting. As of the record date, 98,162,806 shares of common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote
at the special meeting. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote.

        A quorum is required to transact business. Holders of at least a majority of the shares of our common stock must be present at the
special meeting in person or by proxy to constitute a quorum. Abstentions, shares for which authority is withheld to vote for director
nominees, and broker non-votes (i.e., proxies from brokers or nominees regarding proposals for which such broker or nominee lacks
discretionary voting authority and the beneficial owners or other persons entitled to vote have not provided voting instructions) will be
considered present for the purpose of establishing a quorum. In addition, abstentions will also count as votes "AGAINST" a proposal in
cases where approval of the proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and
entitled to vote at the meeting. However, broker non-votes, while being counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present at
the special meeting, will not be counted for purposes of determining the number of votes cast. Therefore, a broker non-vote will make a
quorum more readily available but will not otherwise affect the outcome of the vote on any proposal. Once a share is represented at the
special meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes throughout the meeting, including any adjourned meeting, unless a new record
date is set for the adjourned meeting.

        If less than a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock are present or represented by proxy at the meeting, a majority of the
shares that are present or represented by proxy at the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.

Required Vote 

        Proposal 1:    For the Company to complete the merger, the Company stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock
outstanding at the close of business on the record date, entitled to vote at the company stockholders meeting, voting together as a single
class, must vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. A failure to vote your shares of common stock or an abstention from
voting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        Proposal 2:    Although the outcome of the vote on executive compensation is non-binding, we will consider the outcome of this vote
when determining certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection
with the merger. The merger-related compensation will be paid to the Company's named executive officers in accordance with the terms of
their compensation agreements and arrangements even if stockholders fail to approve this proposal.

Table of Contents

Any shares present and not voted, whether by broker non-vote, abstention or otherwise, will have no effect on this advisory vote regarding
our named executive officers' compensation. If you hold your shares in "street name," your broker or other nominee will not have
discretionary authority to vote your shares if you do not provide instructions as to how your shares should be voted on this proposal.

        Proposal 3:    The vote on adjournment requires an affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by
proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter.

        As of the record date, there were 98,162,806 shares of common stock outstanding and 108 record holders.

Voting by the Company's Directors and Executive Officers 

        At the close of business on the record date, directors and executive officers of the Joy Global were entitled to vote 363,626 shares of
common stock, or less than 1% of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding on that date. We currently expect that the
Company's directors and executive officers will vote their shares in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and the other
proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although they have no obligation to do so.

Voting; Proxies; Revocation 

Attendance 

        All holders of shares of common stock as of the close of business on September 1, 2016, the record date, including stockholders of
record and beneficial owners of common stock registered in the "street name" of a broker, bank or other nominee, are invited to attend the
special meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, please be prepared to provide proper identification, such as a driver's license. If you
hold your shares in "street name," you will need to provide proof of ownership, such as a recent account statement or voting instruction
form provided by your broker, bank or other nominee or other similar evidence of ownership, along with proper identification.

Voting in Person 

        Stockholders of record will be able to vote in person at the special meeting. If you are not a stockholder of record, but instead hold
your shares of common stock in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must provide a legal proxy executed in your
favor from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the special meeting. Attending the meeting in person
does not itself constitute a vote on any proposal.

Providing Voting Instructions by Proxy 

        To ensure that your shares of common stock are voted at the special meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions
promptly by proxy, even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person.

Shares of Common Stock Held by Record Holder

        If you are a stockholder of record, you may provide voting instructions by proxy using one of the methods described below.

        Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet.    This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with instructions for
submitting voting instructions. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the Internet by accessing the Internet
address specified on the enclosed proxy card. Your shares of common stock will be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had
completed, signed, dated and returned your proxy card, as described below.

Table of Contents

        Submit a Proxy Card.    If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received in time for the
special meeting, your shares of common stock will be voted in the manner directed by you on your proxy card.

        If you sign, date and return your proxy card without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of each of the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement, the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become
payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the merger, and the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum. If you fail to return your proxy card and you are a holder of
record on the record date, unless you attend the special meeting and vote in person, the effect will be that your shares of common stock
will not be considered present at the special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the special meeting, will
have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and, assuming a quorum is present, will not affect the
advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of
the Company in connection with the merger, or the vote regarding the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement or in the absence of a quorum.

Shares of Common Stock Held in "Street Name"

        If your shares of common stock are held by a broker, bank or other nominee on your behalf in "street name," your broker, bank or
other nominee will send you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for your shares. Many brokerage firms and banks have a
process for their customers to provide voting instructions by telephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a
voting instruction form.

        In accordance with the rules of the NYSE, brokers, banks and other nominees that hold shares of common stock in "street name" for
their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, the
advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of
the Company in connection with the merger, or the adjournment of the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies or in the absence of a quorum. Accordingly, if brokers, banks or other nominees do not receive specific voting
instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, they may not vote such shares with respect to these proposals. Therefore, unless you
attend the special meeting in person with a properly executed legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee, your failure to provide
instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee will result in your shares of Joy Global common stock not being present at the meeting
and not being voted on any of the proposals. Consequently, there cannot be any broker non-votes occurring in connection with any of the
proposals at the special meeting.

Revocation of Proxies 

        Any proxy may be revoked by the person executing it at any time before the polls close at the special meeting by filing with the
Secretary a written revocation or a duly executed form of proxy bearing a later date, or by voting in person at the special meeting. The Joy
Global board has appointed a representative of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. to act as an independent inspector at the special
meeting. A written revocation may be delivered by mail to Joy Global in care of the Secretary at Joy Global Inc., 100 E. Wisconsin
Avenue, Suite 2780, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202.

Table of Contents

        Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the special meeting without taking one of the actions
described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to the
Company or by sending a written notice of revocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written
notice of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company before the special meeting.

        If you hold your shares in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions provided to
you by your broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit new voting instructions. If you hold your shares in
"street name," you may also revoke a prior proxy by voting in person at the special meeting if you obtain a proxy executed in your favor
from your broker, bank or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the special meeting.

Abstentions 

        An abstention occurs when a stockholder attends a meeting, either in person or represented by proxy, but abstains from voting.
Abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares of common stock present or represented at the special meeting for
purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved. Abstaining from voting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. The requisite number of shares to approve the other two proposals is based on the total number of
shares represented in person or represented by proxy with respect to such proposals. If you do not vote, such failure to vote will have no
effect on the advisory (non-binding) proposal on certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers
of the Company in connection with the merger or the proposal regarding adjournment of the special meeting; if you abstain from voting
with respect to such proposals, such abstention will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" such proposals.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        The Joy Global board is soliciting your proxy, and Joy Global will bear the cost of this solicitation of proxies. This includes the
charges and expenses of brokerage firms and others for forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners of Joy Global's outstanding
common stock. Joy Global has retained D.F. King & Co., Inc., which we refer to as D.F. King, to assist with the solicitation of proxies at a
fee estimated not to exceed $20,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may be solicited by mail, personal interview, e-mail,
telephone, or via the Internet by D.F. King or, without additional compensation, by certain of Joy Global's directors, officers and
employees.

Other Information 

        You should not return your stock certificate or send documents representing common stock with the proxy card. If the merger
is completed, the paying agent for the merger will send you a letter of transmittal and related materials and instructions for exchanging
your shares of common stock for the merger consideration.

THE MERGER (PROPOSAL 1) 

        The description of the merger in this section and elsewhere in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
complete text of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A and is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement.
This summary does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information about the merger that is important to you. You
are encouraged to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety.

Certain Effects of the Merger 

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Joy Global, with Joy Global surviving the
merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Komatsu.

        Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, at the effective time, each share of common stock issued and
outstanding immediately before the effective time (other than dissenting shares and shares owned by Joy Global, Komatsu or any of their
respective subsidiaries, which will be cancelled) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. Upon completion of
the merger, Joy Global's common stock will no longer be publicly traded and Joy Global's existing stockholders will cease to have any
ownership interest in Joy Global.

        The merger consideration will be $28.30 per share in cash, without interest, and subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

        Our common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is listed on the NYSE under the symbol "JOY."

Background of the Merger 

        As part of their ongoing evaluation of Joy Global's business and long-term strategic goals and plans, the Joy Global board and senior
management periodically review, consider and assess, in the context of Joy Global's operations, financial performance and industry
conditions, various strategic alternatives available to Joy Global, including the continued execution of Joy Global's strategy as a stand-
alone company and potential opportunities for business combinations, strategic investments and collaborations and other financial and
strategic alternatives.

        As longstanding advisors of Joy Global, Goldman, Sachs & Co., which we refer to as Goldman Sachs, financial advisor to Joy
Global, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, which we refer to as Wachtell Lipton, legal counsel to Joy Global, from time to time
participated in and assisted the Joy Global board and management with such review of financial and strategic alternatives, including with
respect to Joy Global's continued execution of its strategic plan as an independent, stand-alone company, actions to strengthen Joy Global's
balance sheet such as reductions in the amount of its regular quarterly dividend, amendments to certain covenants in instruments
governing Joy Global's indebtedness and various restructuring and cost reduction activities, a debt or equity investment by a third-party
and a strategic merger or a sale of the company.

        In this section entitled "Background of the Merger," we refer to Komatsu Ltd. as "Komatsu."

        During the week of January 25, 2016, representatives of Morgan Stanley & Co., which we refer to as Morgan Stanley, financial
advisor to Komatsu, contacted Mr. Edward L. Doheny II, President and Chief Executive Officer of Joy Global, on behalf of Komatsu to
indicate that Mr. Tetsuji Ohashi, Chief Executive Officer of Komatsu, was interested in meeting with Mr. Doheny to discuss the Joy Global
business. On February 1, 2016, the Joy Global board met to discuss the inquiry received by Mr. Doheny on behalf of Komatsu. The board
authorized Mr. Doheny and Mr. James M. Sullivan, Chief Financial Officer of Joy Global, to schedule and attend the meeting.

        On February 9, 2016, Mr. Doheny and Mr. Sullivan met in Chicago with Mr. Ohashi and Mr. Yasuhiro Inagaki, General Manager,
Business Coordination Department Supervising Legal Affairs, of Komatsu. At this meeting, Mr. Ohashi and Mr. Doheny discussed their
respective businesses and Mr. Ohashi provided Mr. Doheny with written materials regarding the potential merits of a combination between
the two companies generally, including certain complementary product lines and strategic opportunities in the underground hard rock
segment. Mr. Doheny gave a brief overview of Joy Global's key growth strategies from their public investor presentation material.
However, there was no discussion of specific transaction terms at this meeting.

        On February 23, 2016, Komatsu sent Joy Global a non-binding preliminary proposal providing for the acquisition of Joy Global by
Komatsu for $17 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock. The proposal noted that financing was not a condition of Komatsu's offer.
Komatsu's proposal noted that completion of any transaction would be subject to certain conditions, including a due diligence review of
non-public information of a customary scope and depth and negotiation and completion of definitive acquisition agreements.

        Later on February 23, 2016, Mr. Inagaki telephoned Mr. Doheny to explain Komatsu's proposal. During this conversation,
Mr. Doheny acknowledged receipt of the proposal from Komatsu and indicated that while there may be strategic merits to a combination
between Joy Global and Komatsu, he viewed the proposed price of $17 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock as an insufficient
basis for discussion. However, Mr. Doheny indicated that he would discuss the proposal with the Joy Global board.

        Following discussion between Mr. Doheny and Mr. John Hanson, Chairman of the Joy Global board, on March 1, 2016, Mr. Doheny
sent the February 23 Komatsu letter to the full Joy Global board and indicated that the Joy Global board would discuss the proposal at its
next regularly scheduled in-person meeting on March 7, 2016.

        On March 7, 2016, the Joy Global board discussed Komatsu's proposal at a regular meeting of the board of directors, at which
members of senior management and representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton were present. In connection with these
discussions, members of senior management discussed with the board certain high-level, preliminary financial cases for the future
performance of the business representing Joy Global's standalone plans under two different scenarios. The first scenario presented at the
meeting reflected a slow recovery in the coal mining industry and Joy Global's businesses potentially reaching the low point of the cycle in
2017, and the second reflected a more robust recovery. In particular, the first scenario assumed that the prices for the commodities that
impact Joy Global's businesses would decline substantially in 2016 before slowly recovering from 2017 through 2021, and sales in the
hard rock and industrial market would grow at a significantly stronger rate over that period. The second scenario, by contrast, assumed that
the prices for the commodities that impact Joy Global's businesses would decline much less significantly in 2016, with a slightly stronger
recovery than in the first scenario from 2017 through 2021, and that as compared to the first scenario the sales growth over that period
would be slightly higher in the hard rock and industrial market but significantly stronger in service products.

        Representatives of Goldman Sachs then presented to the Joy Global board certain background materials, including certain potential
strategic partners for Joy Global (which strategic partners included Komatsu). The Joy Global board and its management and advisors also
discussed the current and expected near- and medium-term future of the U.S., China and international coal markets, the current state and
anticipated future prospects for Joy Global's business and market perspectives on Joy Global's business and prospects, taking into account
inherent external uncertainties, and in particular, the very significant challenges impacting the coal mining industry. The Joy Global board
also discussed, among other things, Joy Global's prospects and inherent value (but also risks) as the only remaining pure global mining
equipment player, the industrial logic in combining the businesses of Komatsu and

Joy Global, the value that such transaction would present to Komatsu and whether the timing was appropriate to consider a transaction in
light of the current state of Joy Global's business and the markets in which it operates.

        After extensive discussion at this meeting, the Joy Global board was unwilling to rule out the possibility of a transaction but believed
that $17 per share was an inappropriate valuation, even in a slow recovery scenario. Accordingly, the Joy Global board instructed
Mr. Doheny to inform Komatsu that while Joy Global would be willing to consider potential discussions regarding a transaction,
Komatsu's current proposal of $17 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock significantly undervalued Joy Global and was not a basis
on which Joy Global would enter into discussions or permit Komatsu to begin due diligence of non-public information of Joy Global. In
addition, at the meeting, the Joy Global board noted that it would need to consider which of the two scenarios presented during the
meeting was more appropriate in order to compare Joy Global's plans and prospects relative to a potential transaction with Komatsu. The
board further noted that any decision to pursue a transaction with Komatsu or another potential acquiror would depend significantly on an
updated view of industry conditions, including the extent and timing of any potential turnaround from the current depressed market
conditions in the industry. In preparation for any potential future dialogue regarding a potential transaction and to enable the board to
evaluate any further proposals with the benefit of these views, the Joy Global board directed management to prepare a robust "bottom's
up" financial analysis that would reflect further thinking about the market conditions, for discussion at a subsequent meeting and for use
by Goldman Sachs in any future financial analysis.

        On March 9, 2016, Goldman Sachs provided feedback regarding Komatsu's proposal to Morgan Stanley that conveyed the consensus
of the Joy Global board.

        On March 30, 2016, Komatsu sent Joy Global another letter indicating that it had considered Joy Global's feedback to Komatsu's
February 23 proposal. The March 30 letter contained a revised, non-binding proposal to acquire Joy Global at a price of $23 in cash per
share of Joy Global common stock. The letter also requested that representatives of Joy Global and Komatsu meet in person to discuss
certain key assumptions regarding the Joy Global business made by Komatsu in connection with its revised proposal. As with the
February 23 proposal, Komatsu's letter noted that the revised proposal was subject to Komatsu completing customary confirmatory due
diligence and executing definitive acquisition agreements. The letter further noted that except for the changes described therein, the terms
of the February 23 proposal remained effective.

        On April 11, 2016, the Joy Global board held a special telephonic meeting to discuss Komatsu's March 30 proposal. After discussion,
based on the considerations discussed by the board at this meeting and at prior meetings, the board determined that the proposed price of
$23 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock was insufficient but that management should signal its willingness to schedule the
requested informational meeting. The Joy Global board directed Mr. Doheny to communicate such to Komatsu.

        Later that day, at the request of the Joy Global board, Goldman Sachs telephoned Morgan Stanley to communicate the view of the Joy
Global board that the proposed price of $23 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock was insufficient. Goldman Sachs further noted,
as directed by the Joy Global board, that because Joy Global continued to recognize the strategic merits of potentially combining with
Komatsu, it would be willing to schedule the management meetings requested in Komatsu's March 30 proposal in an effort to enable
Komatsu to improve the terms of its offer. Goldman Sachs noted that, following these meetings, Joy Global would expect Komatsu to
improve its valuation before any further discussions regarding a potential transaction.

        On April 13, 2016, to facilitate discussion at management meetings between representatives of Joy Global and Komatsu, at the
direction of Joy Global, Joy Global's advisors sent Komatsu's advisors a draft confidentiality agreement. During the course of the month of
April, Joy Global, Komatsu and

their respective legal advisors negotiated the terms of the draft confidentiality agreement, which was executed by Joy Global and Komatsu
on May 1 in a form that included standstill provisions.

        On May 1 and May 2, 2016, members of senior management of each of Joy Global and Komatsu met in Chicago to discuss Joy
Global's business and operations. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were also present at the meetings. At these
meetings, representatives of Joy Global provided to Komatsu further information regarding the Joy Global business, including its new
products and business opportunities, and the parties discussed the potential value creation that could result from a combination between
Joy Global and Komatsu.

        On May 17, 2016, Komatsu sent Joy Global a letter that contained a revised, non-binding proposal to acquire Joy Global at a price of
$24.50 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock. The letter noted that Komatsu would like to commence confirmatory due diligence
immediately and that except for the changes described therein, the terms of the February 23 proposal remained effective.

        On May 25, 2016, after discussing the May 17 letter with Mr. Hanson and the company's advisors, Mr. Doheny telephoned
Mr. Ohashi to discuss Komatsu's May 17 proposal. Mr. Doheny said that he would discuss Komatsu's May 17 proposal with the Joy
Global board at its upcoming regular board meeting scheduled for early June. Mr. Doheny told Mr. Ohashi that while he continued to
recognize the strategic merits of potentially combining with Komatsu, he did not believe the offer of $24.50 in cash per share of Joy
Global common stock represented appropriate value for Joy Global. Mr. Doheny further noted that he did not think the Joy Global board
would recommend engaging further with Komatsu at that price but said that he would contact Mr. Ohashi following the Joy Global board
meeting to communicate the board's position.

        On June 2, 2016, Joy Global issued a press release announcing its second quarter fiscal 2016 operating results and providing an
updated company outlook for fiscal year 2016. In connection with that updated outlook, Joy Global noted that the mining industry
continued to face headwinds from oversupplied commodities and reduced cash flows for most producers. The press release further noted
that while there has been mounting evidence of supply curtailments, challenging market conditions were likely to persist, requiring Joy
Global to continue to reduce costs as it positioned for the current and future demand environments. The press release further noted that in
light of lower service sales from the step down in production forecasts for U.S. coal and Canadian oils sands markets, Joy Global expected
sales and earnings for the year (excluding restructuring charges and mark-to-market pension adjustments) to be at the lower end of its
previous guidance range.

        On June 6, 2016, the Joy Global board held its regularly scheduled meeting, at which members of senior management and
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton were present. Members of management informed the board that, in response to the
board's request at the March 8, 2016 meeting, management had prepared a "bottom's up" financial analysis containing additional
information regarding certain aspects of the Joy Global business for compilation into a total company view of the future performance of
the business. It was discussed that this more rigorous analysis resulted in a view that was directionally closer to the scenario involving a
slow recovery in the coal mining industry and Joy Global's businesses that had been presented at the March 8 meeting of the board. There
was an extensive discussion of this analysis and of current and expected future industry conditions among the members of the board,
senior management and advisors, including various sensitivities such as whether any anticipated recoveries were delayed. Representatives
of Wachtell Lipton then discussed with the members of the board their fiduciary duties in connection with their consideration of a potential
transaction with Komatsu. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then presented to the board a financial analysis of Komatsu's May 17 offer
and an overview of financial considerations for Joy Global that took into account the updated detailed analysis presented by management
earlier in the meeting, and which had been previously shared with Goldman Sachs. Following these presentations and further discussion
among the board, and taking into account the

discussion of the board at this meeting and at prior meetings, including the updated detailed analysis presented to the board, it was the
consensus of the board that a sale of Joy Global to a third party at an appropriate price would be in the best interests of Joy Global and its
stockholders.

        During the June 6, 2016 meeting of the Joy Global board, the board also discussed specifically Komatsu's May 17 proposal of $24.50
in cash per share of Joy Global common stock. Based on the discussion at this meeting and at prior meetings, it was the consensus of the
board that the May 17 proposal would not be an acceptable price. The Joy Global board determined that, while it had to date been
successful in obtaining increasingly higher offers from Komatsu without providing any valuation guidance, in order to obtain an even
higher price and best price from Komatsu, it should make a specific counterproposal. After extensive discussion with Joy Global's
management and legal and financial advisors, the Joy Global board instructed Mr. Doheny to deliver to Komatsu a counterproposal of $28
in cash per share of Joy Global common stock. The Joy Global board, with advice from its financial advisors, also discussed in detail
whether or not Joy Global and its financial advisor should affirmatively seek proposals from other potential acquirors. With assistance
from Joy Global's management, representatives of Goldman Sachs presented a specific list of companies, both public and private and
located both in the United States and abroad, that might be both interested in and financially capable of acquiring Joy Global for a price at
least equal to the price Komatsu would be willing to pay. The Joy Global board, with the assistance of management and its advisors,
determined that the list was complete and discussed each of the parties on the list in detail, including the likelihood such party would be
interested in a transaction and such party's financial capacity to complete a transaction if one were to be agreed. After extensive discussion
with management and its advisors of the merits of contacting some or all of the parties on the list, the board determined that Komatsu was
the best buyer for Joy Global and that it was not likely that any other potential party would be willing and capable of acquiring Joy Global
at a price equal to or greater than Komatsu. Based on this discussion, and in light of the potential negative consequences of approaching
other parties (such as the possibility of a leak that could negatively impact a Komatsu transaction and the Company's standalone
operations), the Joy Global board determined that it was not desirable for management or Joy Global's financial advisors to make any
outgoing calls at that time but to focus on obtaining the highest price from Komatsu and appropriate flexibility in any potential definitive
agreement with Komatsu to consider any alternative bids that might arise.

        On June 7, 2016, Mr. Doheny telephoned Mr. Ohashi to communicate the Joy Global board's position that Komatsu needed to
increase its proposal to $28 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock as a basis to commence Komatsu's requested due diligence of
Joy Global.

        On June 12, 2016, Mr. Ohashi telephoned Mr. Doheny to inform him that Komatsu was agreeable to Joy Global's proposal of $28 in
cash per share of Joy Global common stock, subject to completion of due diligence and negotiation and execution of definitive transaction
documentation. Mr. Ohashi indicated that Komatsu desired to continue the next phase of its due diligence evaluation as soon as possible.
Mr. Ohashi and Mr. Doheny agreed that they would each direct their management teams and advisors to commence that process promptly.
Mr. Ohashi and Mr. Doheny each noted that, subject to the results of Komatsu's due diligence investigation, the parties would work toward
announcing any potential transaction during the month of July if a transaction were to occur.

        On June 17, 2016, Joy Global opened an electronic data room containing various non-public materials regarding Joy Global in
response to Komatsu's due diligence requests. Joy Global continued to make additional materials available to Komatsu over the course of
the next several weeks and Komatsu continued its due diligence evaluation of Joy Global during this time, including by holding due
diligence meetings in Chicago with representatives of Joy Global and the parties' respective advisors during late June.

        On June 22, 2016, Wachtell Lipton sent an initial draft of the merger agreement for the potential transaction to Arnold & Porter LLP,
which we refer to as Arnold & Porter, Komatsu's legal counsel.

        On June 30, 2016, Wachtell Lipton and Arnold & Porter held a series of telephone conferences to discuss the key issues that Komatsu
expected to raise in connection with revising the draft of the merger agreement. Arnold & Porter noted that, among other things, Komatsu
intended to propose a significantly lower level of regulatory efforts obligations than were contained in the initial draft of the merger
agreement. Arnold & Porter also noted that Komatsu would request a termination fee payable by Joy Global in certain circumstances equal
to 4% of the equity value of the transaction as well as closing conditions relating to obtaining certain third party consents and the exercise
of appraisal rights by holders of Joy Global common stock. Arnold & Porter also communicated that Komatsu did not view matters
relating to employee retention and ordinary course employee equity grants as matters that needed to be addressed in connection with
negotiating the merger agreement, as was proposed by Joy Global, but rather as topics regarding which Joy Global could seek approval
from Komatsu following announcement.

        On July 1, 2016, the Joy Global board held a special telephonic meeting, at which senior management and representatives of
Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton were present. The board discussed the issues raised by Komatsu in the initial draft of the merger
agreement that were conveyed by Arnold & Porter to Wachtell Lipton on the telephone conferences the previous day. Among other things,
the Joy Global board indicated that the certainty of closing a transaction once one was announced was very important to the board, and
that appropriately addressing matters relating to employee retention and compensation in the merger agreement prior to announcing any
transaction would be essential to ensuring that the Joy Global workforce remained focused and productive after the announcement of any
transaction and to promote certainty of closing. Following this meeting, as directed by the Joy Global board, Wachtell Lipton telephoned
Arnold & Porter to convey the initial reactions and positions of the Joy Global board regarding the issues that Arnold & Porter had
communicated to Wachtell Lipton the previous day.

        On July 3, 2016, Mr. Doheny and Mr. Ohashi spoke via telephone to discuss the key issues in the draft merger agreement that they
had discussed with their respective legal advisors during the prior few days. Shortly following this call, Wachtell Lipton and Arnold &
Porter held a telephone conference to further discuss these issues.

        On July 6, 2016, Arnold & Porter sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Wachtell Lipton. From July 6 through July 21, Joy
Global, Komatsu and their respective legal advisors discussed and negotiated the terms of the merger agreement, and Komatsu and its
advisors continued their due diligence review of Joy Global. In these discussions, the parties negotiated open transaction terms, including
those relating to the issues raised by Arnold & Porter on the June 30 telephone conferences with Wachtell Lipton and in subsequent
conversations between the two legal advisors. Among other things, pursuant to these negotiations, it was agreed that Komatsu America
would be subject to a general "reasonable best efforts" standard in connection with seeking required regulatory approvals. Komatsu also
agreed to certain other requirements proposed by Joy Global and its legal advisors, including, among other things, commitments relating to
obtaining regulatory approvals and a requirement of Komatsu America to pay a $150 million termination fee to Joy Global if the merger
agreement is terminated in certain circumstances relating to the failure of Komatsu America to obtain any required regulatory approval. In
addition, after significant negotiation it was agreed that the termination fee payable by Joy Global to terminate the merger agreement to
accept a competing proposal and in certain other circumstances would equal $75 million. It was also agreed that the merger agreement
would address the matters relating to employee retention and granting of equity awards to employees at levels consistent with past
practice. The parties also agreed that the merger agreement would include a full guaranty by Komatsu of all payment and performance
obligations of

Komatsu America. For more information regarding these provisions and the other terms of the merger agreement, see the section entitled
"The Merger Agreement."

        On July 12 and July 14, 2016, the Joy Global board held special telephonic meetings, at which senior management and
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton were present, to receive updates from Joy Global's management and advisors
regarding the negotiation of the terms of the merger agreement and Komatsu's progress in completing its due diligence review of Joy
Global. During these meetings, Joy Global's management and advisors indicated that the merger agreement and due diligence progress
could likely be completed during the next week, subject to the approval of the Joy Global board. In addition, the Joy Global board noted
that the trading price of shares of Joy Global common stock had increased since Joy Global made its most recent counterproposal on
June 6, and had increased even further over the prior several weeks despite no new specific positive news with respect to Joy Global or its
financial outlook. Although the board was of the opinion that based on its view of Joy Global's fundamental value a price of $28 in cash
per share would be an attractive price, the board instructed management to explore whether Komatsu would be willing to increase its offer
price in light of the decreased nominal premium.

        On July 19, 2016, Mr. Doheny telephoned Mr. Ohashi to inform him that there was concern among members of the Joy Global board
and management regarding the proposed price of $28 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock in light of the fact that it would now
represent a lower premium to the most recent closing price of shares of Joy Global common stock than it would have in early June.
Mr. Ohashi indicated in response that Komatsu would not be willing to increase its proposed price of $28 per share.

        On July 19, 2016, the Joy Global board met in person, together with members of Joy Global management and representatives of
Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton, to further discuss and consider the Komatsu transaction. Mr. Doheny and other members of senior
management briefed the board on the status of negotiations with Komatsu and the due diligence process. The board also received an
updated financial analysis presentation from representatives of Goldman Sachs, including with respect to Joy Global's preliminary
financial analysis and a potential acquisition by Komatsu (based on the latest price of $28 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock
offered by Komatsu). Representatives of Wachtell Lipton discussed the directors' fiduciary duties and presented to the board a detailed
summary of the terms of the current draft of the merger agreement. During the course of these discussions, the Joy Global board
reaffirmed its belief, following further discussion with its financial advisors, that Komatsu was the potential transaction partner most likely
to offer the best value to Joy Global's stockholders and, further, that if there were another buyer capable of and willing to make a more
compelling offer to acquire Joy Global, agreeing to and announcing a transaction with Komatsu would be the best way to elicit any such
offer, which offer would not be precluded by the terms of the merger agreement such as the termination fee payable by Joy Global to
Komatsu in certain specified circumstances of $75 million, which amount the Joy Global board believed to be appropriate taking into
account the range of such termination fees in recent comparable transactions.

        After extensive discussions at this meeting, including regarding the financial analysis prepared by management for discussion at prior
meetings and the financial analysis prepared by Goldman Sachs regarding Joy Global and the proposed Komatsu transaction, and as to the
matters described in the section entitled "The Merger—Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Joy Global Board of Directors,"
the Joy Global board expressed support for the Komatsu transaction. The board authorized Joy Global's management and advisors to seek
to resolve remaining open issues and finalize the merger agreement with a view toward being in a position to publicly announce a
transaction later that week if one were to occur, subject to final board approval. However, consistent with its discussions at the July 14
meeting, the Joy Global board also noted that the trading price of shares of Joy Global common stock had not changed materially since the
July 14 meeting and that, as a result, the proposed price of $28 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock represented a premium of
less than 20% to

the most recent closing price of shares of Joy Global common stock. While the Joy Global board was aware of the premium over the
historic trading prices of Joy Global common stock, and although the views of the Joy Global board as to the fundamental value of Joy
Global had not changed materially since the preliminary agreement on a price of $28 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock (nor
had the value of Joy Global indicated by the financial analysis prepared by Goldman Sachs), the members of the board and Goldman
Sachs noted that a low or relatively low premium relative to the most recent closing price of shares of Joy Global common stock,
particularly one of less than 20% could complicate the announcement of any transaction and associated communications. After further
discussion among the Joy Global board and its legal and financial advisors, it was the consensus of the board that Mr. Doheny should
again telephone Mr. Ohashi to ask again whether Komatsu would be willing to increase the price to a level that would provide a 20%
premium above the closing price on the day prior to announcement of a transaction.

        Following the July 19, 2016 meeting of the Joy Global board, on July 19 and July 20, Joy Global, Komatsu and their respective legal
advisors continued negotiations toward finalizing the merger agreement and completing the due diligence process.

        On July 20, 2016, Mr. Doheny telephoned Mr. Ohashi to propose an increased price of $28.50 in cash per share of Joy Global
common stock, in light of the recent unexplained increase in Joy Global's trading price. After discussion with Mr. Doheny, Mr. Ohashi
made a revised offer of $28.30 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock. Mr. Ohashi noted that a price of $28.30 in cash per share of
Joy Global common stock represented a premium of above 20% to the closing price of shares of Joy Global common stock on the NYSE
that day. Mr. Ohashi stated that Komatsu was unwilling to increase its price to $28.50, but that in an effort to address the concern raised, he
would recommend a price of $28.30, which equated to a premium of 20% to the Joy Global closing price that day. Mr. Doheny agreed to
communicate the revised offer to the Joy Global board and asked that Mr. Ohashi inform him when the Komatsu board approved the
increased price. Mr. Ohashi noted that the Komatsu board was scheduled to meet later that day.

        Later that day, on July 20, 2016, Mr. Ohashi telephoned Mr. Doheny to inform him that the Komatsu board had approved entering
into the merger agreement to acquire Joy Global at the increased price of $28.30 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock, which
revised offer was subject to approval of the Komatsu board. Mr. Ohashi further noted that the Komatsu board had expressed a desire to
publicly announce the transaction around the close of business on July 21 in Japan (which would be during the early morning of July 21 in
Milwaukee).

        During the evening of July 20, 2016, the Joy Global board met telephonically, together with members of Joy Global management and
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Wachtell Lipton. Mr. Doheny informed the board of the increased agreed price of $28.30 in cash per
share of Joy Global common stock and noted that although Joy Global could not identify specific reasons for the increases in the trading
price of its shares of common stock over the past several weeks, it was able to use those increases as a basis to negotiate for a higher price
from Komatsu. Representatives of Wachtell Lipton reviewed with the directors the updated key terms of the merger agreement, and
representatives of Goldman Sachs provided directors with an updated financial analysis presentation, which had been updated since the
July 19 board meeting for more recent stock trading prices and to reflect the updated price of $28.30 in cash per share of Joy Global
common stock from Komatsu. After discussion among the members of the board, management and the board's advisors, representatives of
Goldman Sachs delivered an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed in writing, to the board of directors of Joy Global to the
effect that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and
limitations and qualifications on the review undertaken described in its written opinion, the per share price to be received in the merger by
holders of Joy Global common stock (other than Komatsu and its affiliates) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. See
the section entitled "The Merger—Opinion of Goldman Sachs" for more information. Following discussion among the directors, after
careful consideration, the Joy Global board unanimously determined that the merger agreement and the merger were fair to, advisable and
in the best interests of Joy Global and its stockholders and unanimously approved the merger agreement and the merger.

        Following approval by the boards of each of Joy Global and Komatsu of the merger and the merger agreement, late in the evening on
July 20, 2016 in the United States and during the morning of July 21, 2016, in Japan, Komatsu and Joy Global finalized and executed the
merger agreement.

        On July 21, 2016, Joy Global and Komatsu each issued a press release announcing execution of the merger agreement.

Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Joy Global Board of Directors 

        The Joy Global board, with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors, evaluated the merger agreement, the merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that the merger
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Joy Global and its
stockholders. Accordingly, the Joy Global board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Joy Global vote "FOR" the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        In this section entitled "Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Joy Global Board of Directors," we refer to Komatsu Ltd. as
"Komatsu."

        In the course of reaching its recommendation, the Joy Global board considered the following positive factors relating to the merger
agreement and the merger, each of which the board believed supported its decision:

• Attractive Value.  The Joy Global board believed that the price of $28.30 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock
provided stockholders with attractive value for their shares of Joy Global common stock. In considering the price of $28.30
in cash per share, the Joy Global board noted that this price: 

• represented a premium of approximately 48% to the volume weighted average closing price of Joy Global's
common stock for the 90 trading days prior to and including July 20, 2016, the last trading day before public
announcement of the transaction; 

• represented a premium of approximately 41% to the volume weighted average closing price of Joy Global's
common stock for the 60 trading days prior to and including July 20, 2016, the last trading day before public
announcement of the transaction; 

• represented a premium of approximately 20% to the closing price of Joy Global's common stock on July 20, 2016,
the last trading day before public announcement of the transaction; and 

• implied an enterprise value to fiscal year 2016 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiple (based on IBES consensus
estimates for EBITDA as of July 20, 2016) for Joy Global of approximately 16.4x. 

• Historically Challenging Industry Environment and Outlook.  The Joy Global board considered the historically challenging
industry environment in recent years and the expected outlook for the mining industry, noting that the demand for original
equipment sales and for service of Joy Global's products is driven primarily by price volatility of the commodities that its
equipment is used to mine. In particular, the Joy Global board noted: 

• the declining prices of coal, iron ore, copper, natural gas and other commodities that indirectly effect Joy Global's
operations and profitability, and that depressed commodity prices were expected to persist in the near- to medium-
term; 

• the decreasing levels of coal burn and coal production in the U.S. and China in recent years that were expected to
continue to decrease;

Table of Contents

• the increase in coal-fired power plant closures in the U.S. in 2015 and 2016 as compared to recent prior years and
that additional closures were expected to occur in future years; 

• that capital expenditures in the mining industry had declined each year since 2013 and were expected to continue to
decline and remain at depressed levels in the near- to medium-term; 

• that several coal industry participants, including significant Joy Global customers such as Peabody Energy, had
recently commenced bankruptcy proceedings given the historically challenging environment for coal; and 

• that Joy Global's business performance continued to deteriorate during the period subsequent to the initiation of
discussions with Komatsu in February 2016. 

• Best Alternative for Maximizing Stockholder Value.  The Joy Global board considered that the merger consideration was
more favorable to Joy Global's stockholders than the potential value that would reasonably be expected to result from other
alternatives reasonably available to Joy Global, in light of a number of factors, including: 

• the Joy Global board's assessment of Joy Global's business, assets and prospects, its competitive position, its
historical and projected financial performance and its short-term and long-term capital needs, including in each
case, in light of the market and industry outlook described above under "Historically Challenging Industry
Environment and Outlook" and Joy Global's business plan; 

• the strategic and financial alternatives reasonably available to Joy Global, and the risks and uncertainties associated
with those alternatives, none of which were deemed likely to result in value to Joy Global's stockholders that would
exceed, on a present-value basis, the value of the merger consideration; 

• that a significant amount of the growth in Joy Global's forward looking plans was dependent on the successful
introduction of new products and a recovery in coal market conditions, both of which are inherently uncertain; 

• the Joy Global board's belief, after consultation with its financial advisors, that Komatsu was the most logical
acquiror of Joy Global and, in light of Komatsu's industry position, strong balance sheet and financial position and
Komatsu's and Joy Global's complementary products and businesses, that Komatsu would be the potential
transaction partner most likely to offer the best combination of value and closing certainty to Joy Global's
stockholders and, further, that if there were another buyer capable of and willing to make a more compelling offer
to acquire Joy Global, agreeing to and announcing a transaction with Komatsu would be the best way to elicit any
such offer, which offer would not be precluded by the terms of the merger agreement, including that the termination
fee payable by Joy Global to terminate the merger agreement to accept a competing proposal and in certain other
circumstances would equal $75 million, which amount the Joy Global board believed to be appropriate taking into
account the range of such termination fees in recent comparable transactions; 

• the fact that Joy Global and Komatsu undertook extensive negotiations, resulting in substantially increased merger
consideration for the Joy Global stockholders as compared to Komatsu's earlier proposals; and 

• the Joy Global board's belief, based on input from senior management and Joy Global's advisors with respect to
Komatsu's statements made and positions taken during extensive negotiations, that the price of $28.30 in cash per
share of Joy Global common stock reflected in the merger agreement was the maximum amount that Komatsu
would be willing

to pay to acquire Joy Global and the risk that any delay or interruption in the negotiations 
with Komatsu could result in Komatsu withdrawing or lowering its price either as a result of a continued deterioration in
the commodities markets and Joy Global's business, or otherwise.

• Fairness Opinion of Goldman Sachs.  The Joy Global board considered the financial analysis presentation of Goldman
Sachs and the opinion of Goldman Sachs rendered to the Joy Global board to the effect that, as of the date of that opinion
and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations and
qualifications on the review undertaken described therein, the per share price to be received in the merger by holders of Joy
Global common stock (other than Komatsu and its affiliates) was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders (as
more fully described in the section entitled "The Merger—Opinion of Goldman Sachs"). 

• Certainty of Value.  The Joy Global board considered that the proposed merger consideration is all cash, thereby providing
Joy Global's stockholders with certainty of value and liquidity for their shares, especially when viewed against the risks and
uncertainties inherent in Joy Global's business, including the internal and external risks associated with Joy Global's
standalone strategy. 

• High Probability of Completion.  The Joy Global board considered the likelihood of completion of the merger to be high,
particularly in light of the terms of the merger agreement, including: 

• the commitment of Komatsu America in the merger agreement to use its reasonable best efforts to complete the
merger, including its commitment to make certain divestitures of assets, businesses and product lines representing
up to $600 million of revenues if required to obtain the necessary antitrust clearances, its commitment to litigate if
necessary in connection with obtaining the required approvals (subject to certain limitations described in the merger
agreement), and its obligation to pay a $150 million termination fee to Joy Global if the merger agreement is
terminated in certain circumstances relating to the failure of Komatsu America to obtain any such clearance (see the
section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Efforts" for more information); 

• the absence of a financing condition in the merger agreement, the belief that Komatsu America would have the
financial resources needed to complete the merger, the representations of Komatsu America in the merger
agreement as to its financial capability and the guarantee by Komatsu in the merger agreement of the full and
timely payment and performance of the duties, obligations and responsibilities of Komatsu America (see the section
entitled "The Merger—Financing" for more information); 

• the full guaranty by Komatsu of all of the payment and performance obligations of Komatsu America in the merger
agreement; and 

• the conditions to closing contained in the merger agreement, which are customary in number and scope, and which,
in the case of the condition related to the accuracy of Joy Global's representations and warranties, are generally
subject to a "Material Adverse Effect" qualification that the Joy Global board viewed as favorable given that it does
not permit taking into account any change or condition affecting the mining or heavy equipment manufacturing and
servicing industries in North America or in any other region where such industries exist for purposes of determining
whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred (see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to
Completion of the Merger" for more information).

Table of Contents

• Opportunity to Receive and Accept a Superior Proposal.  The Joy Global board considered the terms of the merger
agreement permitting Joy Global to respond to unsolicited alternative proposals, and the other terms of the merger
agreement, including: 

• Joy Global's right, subject to certain conditions, to respond to and negotiate unsolicited acquisition proposals made
before the time Joy Global's stockholders adopt the merger 
agreement, which was not expected to take place for several months after the public announcement of the Komatsu
transaction, giving any other potential acquiror ample time to make such a proposal (see the section entitled "The
Merger Agreement—Alternative Proposals; No Solicitation" for more information); 

• the right of the Joy Global board to terminate the merger agreement in specified circumstances relating to a superior
proposal, subject, in specified cases, to payment of a termination fee of $75 million, which amount the Joy Global
board believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and taking into account the range of such termination fees
in similar transactions, and the board's view that a fee of such size would not be a deterrent to a superior alternative
acquisition proposal (see the sections entitled "The Merger Agreement—Alternative Proposals; No Solicitation—
Fiduciary Exception," "The Merger Agreement—Termination" and "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee" for
more information); and 

• the right of Joy Global stockholders who do not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement to seek
appraisal of the fair value of their shares of Joy Global common stock as determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery if the merger is completed, but only if they submit a written demand for such an appraisal before the vote
on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement and comply with the other Delaware law procedures explained in the
accompanying proxy statement (see the section entitled "Appraisal Rights" for more information).

        In the course of reaching its recommendation, the Joy Global board also considered the risks and potentially negative factors relating
to the merger agreement and the merger, including:

• that Joy Global stockholders will have no ongoing equity participation in Joy Global or the combined company following
the merger, and that such stockholders will therefore cease to participate in Joy Global's and the combined company's
future earnings or growth, if any, or to benefit from increases, if any, in the value of the Joy Global common stock or
Komatsu's shares; 

• the possibility, though unlikely from Joy Global's perspective, that the merger does not close (including as a result of events
outside of either party's control) and that completion of the merger could take up to 18 months after execution of the
merger agreement, as well as the risks and costs to Joy Global if the merger does not close, including that the $150 million
termination fee payable to Joy Global by Komatsu America is only payable in certain circumstances and, even if it is paid,
may not adequately compensate Joy Global for the cost of the disruption to its business for up to 18 months; 

• the fact that Komatsu's commitments in the merger agreement to seek to complete the merger are subject to specified
limitations and that the necessary antitrust clearances to complete the merger might not be obtained in a timely manner, or
at all (see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Efforts" for more information); 

• the adverse impact on Joy Global if there is uncertainty about the likelihood, timing or effects of completion of the merger,
including uncertainty about the effect of the proposed merger on Joy Global's employees, potential and existing customers
and suppliers and other parties, which may impair Joy Global's ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and
could cause third

parties to seek to change or not enter into business relationships with Joy Global, as well as the risk of management
distraction as a result of the merger;

• the merger agreement's restrictions on the conduct of Joy Global's business before completion of the merger, generally
requiring Joy Global to conduct its business in the ordinary course and prohibiting Joy Global from taking specified actions
(as more fully described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conduct of Business Pending the Merger"); 

• the possibility that Joy Global could be required under the terms of the merger agreement to pay a termination fee of
$75 million in certain circumstances (as more fully described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination
—Termination Fee"); 

• that the receipt of cash by stockholders in exchange for their shares of Joy Global common stock pursuant to the merger
will be a taxable transaction to Joy Global stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes (as more fully described in
the section entitled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger"); and 

• the risks of the type and nature described under the section entitled and "Forward-Looking Statements" and in the risk
factors included in the documents incorporated by reference in the proxy statement.

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Joy Global board includes the material factors considered
by the Joy Global board but does not necessarily include all of the factors considered by the Joy Global board. In view of the complexity
and variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger, the Joy Global board did not
find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its
determination and recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The Joy Global
board unanimously recommended that the stockholders of Joy Global vote in favor of adoption of the merger agreement based upon the
totality of information it considered.

Opinion of Joy Global's Financial Advisor 

        In connection with the merger, Joy Global's financial advisor, Goldman Sachs delivered its written opinion, dated July 21, 2016, to
the Joy Global board, to the effect that, as of July 21, 2016 and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the
$28.30 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock to be paid to holders (other than Komatsu Ltd. and its affiliates) of the outstanding
shares of Joy Global common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders. In this
section entitled "Opinion of Joy Global's Financial Advisor," we refer to Komatsu Ltd. as "Komatsu."

        The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated July 21, 2016, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex B to
this proxy statement. The summary of the Goldman Sachs opinion contained in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of Goldman Sachs' written opinion. Goldman Sachs' advisory services and opinion were provided for the
information and assistance of the Joy Global board in connection with its consideration of the merger, and such opinion does not
constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Joy Global's common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any
other matter. Pursuant to an engagement letter between Joy Global and Goldman Sachs, Joy Global has agreed to pay Goldman
Sachs a transaction fee of approximately $28.5 million, all of which is contingent upon consummation of the merger.

        In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed,
among other things:

• the merger agreement; 

• annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Joy Global for the five fiscal years ended October 30,
2015; 

• certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Joy Global; 

• certain other communications from Joy Global and Komatsu to their respective stockholders; 

• certain publicly available research analyst reports for Joy Global and Komatsu; and 

• certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for Joy Global prepared by its management summarized in the section
entitled "Certain Joy Global Unaudited Prospective Financial Information", as approved by Joy Global for use by Goldman
Sachs (the "Joy Global Forecasts").

        Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior management of Joy Global regarding their assessment of the past
and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Joy Global; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for
the shares of Joy Global common stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for Joy Global with similar information
for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business
combinations in the mining and industrial equipment manufacturing industries and in other industries; and performed such other studies
and analyses, and considered such other factors, as Goldman Sachs deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of Joy Global, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and
completeness of all of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by,
Goldman Sachs, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed, with
the consent of Joy Global, that the Joy Global Forecasts had been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best then currently
available estimates and judgments of Joy Global management. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation, appraisal or
geological or technical assessment of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and
liabilities) of Joy Global or any of its subsidiaries, and Goldman Sachs was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman
Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the merger would be
obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the merger in any way meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs assumed
that the merger would be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or
condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.

        Goldman Sachs' opinion did not address the underlying business decision of Joy Global to engage in the merger, or the relative merits
of the merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may have been available to Joy Global; nor did it address any legal, regulatory,
tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an
acquisition of, or other business combination with, Joy Global or any other alternative transaction. Goldman Sachs' opinion addresses only
the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Komatsu and its affiliates) of shares of Joy Global common stock, as
of July 21, 2016, of the $28.30 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement.
Goldman Sachs did not express any view on, and its opinion did not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the
merger or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in

connection with the merger, including the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders
of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Joy Global; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any
compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Joy Global, or class of such persons, in connection
with the merger, whether relative to the $28.30 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock to be paid to the holders (other than
Komatsu and its affiliates) of shares of Joy Global common stock, pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Goldman Sachs did not
express any opinion as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of Joy Global or Komatsu or the ability of Joy Global or
Komatsu to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs' opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary,
market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Goldman Sachs as of, July 21, 2016, the date of its
opinion, and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances,
developments or events occurring after July 21, 2016. Goldman Sachs' advisory services and its opinion were provided for the information
and assistance of the Joy Global board in connection with its consideration of the merger and such opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how any holder of shares of Joy Global common stock should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter.
Goldman Sachs' opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.

Summary of Material Financial Analyses 

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Joy Global board in connection
with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the
financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent the relative importance or weight
given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular
format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description of Goldman Sachs'
financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based
on market data as it existed on or before July 20, 2016, the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger, and is not
necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

Historical Stock Trading Analysis

        Goldman Sachs reviewed the historical trading prices and volumes for Joy Global common stock for the one year period ended
July 20, 2016, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the merger. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the $28.30 in cash per
share of Joy Global common stock to be paid to the holders of Joy Global common stock (other than Komatsu and its affiliates) pursuant
to the merger agreement, in relation to the closing market price of shares of Joy Global common stock on July 20, 2016, the 52-week high
and low market prices of shares of Joy Global common stock for the period ended July 20, 2016, the volume-weighted average closing
prices of shares of Joy Global common stock for the 30-day, 60-day and 90-day periods ended July 20, 2016 and the median research
target price of $20.00 per share of Joy Global common stock.

        This analysis indicated that the price per share to be paid to Joy Global stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement represented:

• a premium of 20% to the closing market price on July 20, 2016 of $23.55 per share of Joy Global common stock; 

• a discount of 2% based on the 52-week intraday high market price of $28.99 per share of Joy Global common stock for the
52-week period ended on July 20, 2016; 

• a premium of 239% based on the 52-week intraday low market price of $8.35 per share of Joy Global common stock for
the 52-week period ended on July 20, 2016;

• a premium of 30% to the volume-weighted average closing price of $21.72 per share of Joy Global common stock for the
30-day period ended on July 20, 2016; 

• a premium of 41% to the volume-weighted average closing price of $20.01 per share of Joy Global common stock for the
60-day period ended on July 20, 2016; 

• a premium of 48% to the volume-weighted average closing price of $19.12 per share of Joy Global common stock for the
90-day period ended on July 20, 2016; 

• a premium of 42% to the median research target price of $20.00 per share of Joy Global common stock.

Analysis at Various Prices

        Goldman Sachs calculated various financial multiples and ratios for Joy Global using (i) the closing price of shares of Joy Global
common stock on July 20, 2016 and (ii) the offer price of $28.30 in cash per share of Joy Global common stock to be paid pursuant to the
merger agreement.

        The multiples and ratios were based on information obtained from Joy Global Management and the Institutional Brokers' Estimate
System, known as IBES, as of July 20, 2016. Goldman Sachs calculated, among other things:

• enterprise value, or EV, which is the market capitalization of Joy Global calculated using the closing price of shares of Joy
Global common stock multiplied by the number of fully diluted shares of Joy Global common stock outstanding, as
provided by Joy Global management, plus the total debt amount, less cash and cash equivalents of Joy Global as of
April 29, 2016, as a multiple of Joy Global's actual reported and estimated sales, which is referred to below as EV/Sales,
for the four quarter period ended April 29, 2016, which period we refer to as "LTM", and for fiscal year 2016, respectively;

• EV as a multiple of Joy Global's management-adjusted and estimated EBITDA, which is referred to below as EV/
EBITDA, for LTM and for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively; and 

• Share price as a multiple of Joy Global's estimated earnings, which is referred to below as P/E, for fiscal years 2016
and 2017, respectively.

Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis

        Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future value per share of Joy Global common
stock, which is designed to provide an indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of a company's equity as a function of
such company's estimated future financial performance. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used Joy Global Forecasts for fiscal years 2019,
2020 and 2021. Goldman Sachs first calculated illustrative enterprise values of Joy Global at the end of each of the fiscal years 2018, 2019
and 2020 by multiplying the respective one-year forward adjusted EBITDA (defined as EBITDA adjusted to account for excess purchase
accounting, restructuring costs, mark-to-market pension and other pension items, impairment charges, acquisition costs and other non-
recurring items) estimates per the Joy Global Forecasts for the fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021 by one-year forward enterprise value to
adjusted EBITDA multiples ranging from 7.5x to 8.5x. Goldman Sachs then subtracted Joy Global's net debt as of the relevant year end
per the Joy Global Forecasts from the illustrative enterprise values in order to calculate the implied future equity values. The value of
accreted dividends was added to the implied future equity values, and the total value was divided by the projected fiscal year end fully
diluted shares of Joy Global common stock outstanding, as provided in the Joy Global Forecasts. Goldman Sachs then calculated the
implied present values of the implied per share future values of Joy Global common stock by discounting to present values as of April 29,
2016 using an illustrative discount rate range of 16.0% to 19.0%, reflecting an estimate of Joy Global's cost of equity. This analysis
resulted in a range of implied present values of $22 to $31 (values rounded) per share of Joy Global common stock.

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis of Joy Global. Using discount rates ranging from 14.0% to
15.0%, reflecting estimates of Joy Global's weighted average cost of capital, and the Joy Global Forecasts, Goldman Sachs discounted to
present value as of April 29, 2016 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for Joy Global for the six months ending October 31, 2016 and
the five years ending October 31, 2021, and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for Joy Global as of October 31, 2021, which were
calculated by applying a terminal multiple range of 8.0x to 9.0x to an estimate of Joy Global's terminal EBITDA. Goldman Sachs derived
ranges of illustrative enterprise values for Joy Global by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman Sachs then
subtracted Joy Global's net debt as of April 29, 2016, as provided in Joy Global's 10-Q fillings as of the fiscal quarter ending on April 29,
2016, from the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived to derive a range of illustrative equity values for Joy Global. Goldman
Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Joy Global, as
provided by the management of Joy Global, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share ranging from $24 to $29 (values
rounded).

Selected Transactions Analysis

        Goldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the selected transactions in the heavy equipment industry listed below using
Merger Market, press releases and public financial reports.

        For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared the target's total enterprise value, as implied by the
precedent transaction, as a multiple of the target's adjusted EBITDA for the most recently reported latest twelve month period ending prior
to the announcement of the transaction ("EV / LTM EBITDA"). Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to Joy
Global or Komatsu, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly traded companies with operations that for purposes of
analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of Joy Global and Komatsu.

        The following table presents the results of this analysis:

        Based on the results described above and other factors that Goldman Sachs considered appropriate, and applying its experience and
professional judgment, Goldman Sachs applied an illustrative EV / LTM EBITDA multiple range of 11x to 17x to the fiscal year 2016
adjusted EBITDA

        Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed the acquisition premia for all cash transactions involving the acquisition of United States
public companies with equity values of greater than $1 billion announced between January 1, 2004 and July 20, 2016, using publically
available sources and Thompson data. Announced premia were calculated relative to the target's closing share price (i) one day prior to
announcement of the applicable transaction and (ii) volume-weighted average closing price for 60 days prior to announcement of the
applicable transaction. The following table summarizes the results of this analysis:

Average 1-Day Prior Acquisition Premia 

Average 60-Day VWAP Prior Acquisition Premia 

        Goldman Sachs derived a range in line with the average premia observed over this time period for the relevant transactions of 30% to
40% for each of the average one-day acquisition premia and the average 60-day VWAP acquisition premia. Applying these acquisition
premia to the closing share price

of Joy Global common stock on July 20, 2016, Goldman Sachs calculated a range of implied per share values of Joy Global common stock
of $31 to $33, with respect to one-day acquisition premia, and $26 to $28, with respect to the average 60-day VWAP acquisition premia.

Other Important Considerations 

        The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create
an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs
considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,
Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results
of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to Joy Global or
Komatsu or the contemplated transaction.

        Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of providing its opinion to the Joy Global board as to the fairness from a
financial point of view to the holders of Joy Global common stock (other than Komatsu and its affiliates) of the $28.30 in cash per share of
Joy Global common stock to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor
do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results
are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.
Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties
or their respective advisors, none of Joy Global, Komatsu, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are
materially different from those forecast.

        The merger consideration was determined through arm's-length negotiations between Joy Global and Komatsu and was approved by
the Joy Global board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to Joy Global during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however,
recommend any specific amount of consideration to Joy Global or the Joy Global board or that any specific amount of consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.

        As described above, Goldman Sachs' opinion to the Joy Global board was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Joy
Global board in making its determination to approve the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete
description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B to this proxy statement.

        Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research,
investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and
its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which
they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans,
commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of Joy Global, Komatsu, any of their respective affiliates and
third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement for the
accounts of Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees and their customers. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to Joy Global
in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.
Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Joy Global and its affiliates from time to time for
which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has received, and may

receive, compensation. Goldman Sachs also has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Komatsu and/or its
affiliates from time to time. During the two-year period ended July 21, 2016, the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has not
performed any financial advisory and/or underwriting services for Komatsu or any of its affiliates, or for Joy Global or any of its affiliates,
for which it has received compensation. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to
Joy Global, Komatsu and their respective affiliates for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive
compensation.

        The Joy Global board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated July 20, 2016, Joy Global
engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection with the contemplated transaction. The engagement letter between Joy
Global and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee of approximately $28.5 million, all of which is contingent upon consummation
of the merger. In the event the merger agreement is terminated prior to consummation of the merger or the merger is not otherwise
consummated, the engagement letter between Joy Global and Goldman Sachs provides for a payment to Goldman Sachs equal to the lesser
of the transaction fee that would have been payable to Goldman Sachs (approximately $28.5 million) and 30% of any payment or other
consideration Joy Global receives pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement related to such termination or non-consummation. In
addition, Joy Global has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, and
to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

Certain Joy Global Unaudited Prospective Financial Information 

        In connection with the merger, Joy Global's management prepared the Joy Global Forecasts for internal use and provided them to the
Joy Global board, for the purposes of considering, analyzing and evaluating Joy Global's strategic and financial alternatives, including the
merger. The Joy Global Forecasts were also provided to Goldman Sachs in connection with rendering their respective fairness opinions to
the Joy Global board and in performing the related analyses. Joy Global does not as a matter of course make public projections as to future
performance due to, among other reasons, the inherent difficulty of accurately predicting financial performance for future periods and the
uncertainty of underlying assumptions and estimates. However, Joy Global is including in this proxy statement a summary of certain
limited unaudited prospective financial information for Joy Global on a stand-alone basis, without giving effect to the merger, to give Joy
Global stockholders access to certain nonpublic information provided to the Joy Global board and Goldman Sachs for purposes of
considering and evaluating the merger. The inclusion of the Joy Global Forecasts should not be regarded as an indication that the Joy
Global board, Joy Global, Goldman Sachs, or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it to be an assurance of
the achievement of future results or an accurate prediction of future results, and they should not be relied on as such.

        The Joy Global Forecasts and the underlying assumptions upon which the Joy Global Forecasts were based are subjective in many
respects, and subject to multiple interpretations and frequent revisions attributable to the cyclicality of Joy Global's industry and based on
actual experience and business developments. The Joy Global Forecasts reflect numerous assumptions with respect to company
performance, industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of
which are difficult to predict, subject to significant economic and competitive uncertainties and beyond Joy Global's control. Multiple
factors, including those described in the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements," could cause the
Joy Global Forecasts or the underlying assumptions to be inaccurate. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Joy Global Forecasts
will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than projected. Because the Joy Global Forecasts cover
multiple years,

such information by its nature becomes less reliable with each successive year. The Joy Global Forecasts do not take into account any
circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared. Economic and business environments can and do change
quickly, which adds an additional significant level of uncertainty as to whether the results portrayed in the Joy Global Forecasts will be
achieved. As a result, the inclusion of the Joy Global Forecasts in this proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation
by Joy Global or any other person that the information is material. The summary of the Joy Global Forecasts is not provided to influence
Joy Global stockholders' decisions regarding whether to vote for the merger proposal.

        The Joy Global Forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or toward compliance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst &
Young"), Joy Global's independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other accounting firm, has examined, compiled or performed
any procedures with respect to the Joy Global Forecasts, and accordingly, Ernst & Young does not express an opinion or any other form of
assurance with respect thereto. The Ernst & Young report incorporated by reference in this proxy statement relates to Joy Global's
historical financial information. It does not extend to the prospective financial information contained herein and should not be read to do
so.

        The following is a summary of the Joy Global Forecasts:

been or will be taken as a result of the merger agreement having been executed, or the effect of any business or strategic decisions or
actions that would likely have been taken if the merger agreement had not been executed, but that were instead altered, accelerated,
postponed or not taken in anticipation of the merger. Further, the Joy Global Forecasts do not take into account the effect on Joy Global of
any possible failure of the merger to occur.

        For the foregoing reasons, and considering that the special meeting will be held several months after the Joy Global Forecasts were
prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasting information, readers of this proxy statement are cautioned not to place
unwarranted reliance on the Joy Global Forecasts set forth above. No one has made or makes any representation to any stockholder
regarding the information included in the Joy Global Forecasts. Joy Global urges all Joy Global stockholders to review its most recent SEC
filings for a description of its reported financial results. See the section entitled "Where You Can Find Additional Information."

        In addition, the Joy Global Forecasts have not been updated or revised to reflect information or results after the date the Joy Global
Forecasts were prepared or as of date of this proxy statement, and except as required by applicable securities laws, Joy Global does not
intend to update or otherwise revise the Joy Global Forecasts or the specific portions presented to reflect circumstances existing after the
date when made or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions are shown to be in error.
None of the Joy Global board, Joy Global, Goldman Sachs, or any of Joy Global's and Komatsu's affiliates assumes any responsibility for
the validity, accuracy or completeness of the Joy Global Forecasts.

Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of the Company's board that you vote to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that
aside from their interests as stockholders of the Company, the directors and executive officers of the Company may have interests in the
merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of other stockholders of the Company generally. The members of the Company's
board were aware of, and considered, these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the
merger, and in recommending to the stockholders of the Company that the merger agreement be adopted. The Company's stockholders
should take these interests into account in deciding whether to vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. These interests are
described in more detail below, and certain of them are quantified within the narrative disclosure and the table below. The transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement will be a "change in control," "change of control," or term of similar meaning for purposes of the
Company's executive compensation and benefit plans and agreements described below.

Certain Assumptions 

        Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this section, the
following assumptions were used:

• The relevant price per share of the Company common stock is $28.30, which is the amount of the merger consideration; 

• The effective time is August 11, 2016, which is the assumed date of the closing of the merger solely for purposes of the
disclosure in this section; 

• Each executive officer of the Company experiences a qualifying termination, including a termination by the Company
without "cause" or resignation by the named executive officer for "good reason," as such terms are defined in the relevant
Company plans and agreements, immediately following the assumed effective time of August 11, 2016.

Table of Contents

Equity Compensation 

        Treatment of Stock Options.    At the effective time, each Joy Global stock option that is outstanding as of the effective time, whether
vested or unvested, will be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive a cash payment (without interest and less applicable
withholding taxes) equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Joy Global common stock subject to such option as of immediately
prior to the effective time and (2) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration over the exercise price per share of such option as of
immediately prior to the effective time.

        Treatment of Company Restricted Share Unit Awards and Company Performance Share Awards.    At the effective time, each Joy
Global restricted share unit award that was granted prior to the date of the merger agreement, each Joy Global restricted share unit award
that is held by a non-employee director (whether granted to such director prior to or after the date of the merger agreement) and each Joy
Global performance share award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled in consideration for the
right to receive a cash payment (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of
Joy Global common stock subject to such award as of immediately prior to the effective time and (2) the merger consideration. For each
Joy Global performance share award outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, the number of shares subject to the applicable
award shall be one hundred percent of the "Target Number of Performance Shares" set forth in the award at the time of grant.

        At the effective time, each Joy Global restricted share unit award granted after the date of the merger agreement (other than any such
award granted to a non-employee director), that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be converted into a long-
term incentive award that entitles the holder to receive a fixed amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Joy
Global common stock underlying such award as of immediately prior to the effective time and (2) the merger consideration. Each resulting
long-term incentive award will be subject to the same vesting terms that applied to the corresponding Joy Global restricted share unit
award as of immediately prior to the effective time. In the event of a holder's termination of employment without cause or for good reason
following the effective time, the cash long-term incentive award will vest on a prorated basis reflecting the portion of the three-year
vesting period that has elapsed prior to the termination of employment, provided that if the termination occurs during the first year of the
three-year vesting period a minimum of one-third of the award will vest. As of the date of this proxy statement, no restricted share unit
awards have been granted to executive officers or directors of the Company after the date of the merger agreement.

Quantification of Equity Compensation

        See the section entitled "Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Quantification of Potential
Payments and Benefits to the Company's Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger" beginning on page 47 of this proxy
statement for an estimate of the value of the unvested equity awards held by each of the Company's named executive officers that will
become vested at the effective time. Based on the assumptions described above under "—Certain Assumptions", (i) the estimated
aggregate value of the unvested equity awards held by the Company's three executive officers who are not named executive officers that
will become vested at the effective time is $4,174,894, and (ii) the estimated aggregate value of the unvested restricted stock units held by
the Company's eight non-employee directors that will become vested at the effective time is $1,236,144. For more information on equity
holdings of the Company's non-employee directors and named executive officers, see the table entitled "Security Ownership of Certain
Beneficial Owners and Management" on page 79 of this proxy statement.

Change in Control Employment Agreements 

Change in Control Employment Agreements with Named Executive Officers

        The Company has entered into a change in control employment agreement (a "CIC Agreement") with each named executive officer
providing for the continued employment of such officer for a period of three years following a change in control of the Company. Each
CIC Agreement provides that, for so long as the named executive officer remains employed during such three-year period, his position,
duties compensation and benefits will be at least commensurate with those in effect prior to the change in control (and, with respect to
incentive compensation opportunities and savings and retirement benefit opportunities, also not less favorable to the officer than those in
effect for other peer executives of the Company and its affiliates at any time after the change in control).

        Under each CIC Agreement, upon a termination of the named executive officer's employment by the Company other than for cause or
disability, or due to the named executive officer's resignation for good reason, in each case within three years following a change in control
(or prior to a change in control, if it is reasonably demonstrated by the officer that such termination was at the request of a third party that
has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a change in control or otherwise arose in connection with, or anticipation of, a change in
control), the officer is entitled to receive:

• a lump sum cash severance payment equal to a multiple (three times in the case of Mr. Doheny or two times in the case of
Messrs. Sullivan, Major and Maritz) of the sum of (a) the officer's annual base salary (defined as 12 times the highest
monthly base salary paid or payable to the officer in the twelve-month period preceding the month in which a change in
control occurs) and (b) the highest of (i) the annual bonus earned for the fiscal year prior to change in control, (ii) the target
bonus for the year of termination, and (iii) the target bonus for the year of the change in control (such highest amount, the
"highest annual bonus"), 

• a lump sum prorated cash bonus payment equal to the highest annual bonus multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the fiscal year through the date of the qualifying termination of employment and the
denominator of which is 365 (which is also payable upon a termination due to death, disability, or voluntary resignation by
the officer without good reason), 

• for a specified period following termination of employment (three years in the case of Mr. Doheny or two years in the case
of Messrs. Sullivan, Major and Maritz), continued welfare benefits for the officer and his family at least equal to those that
would have been provided under the CIC Agreement absent a termination of employment or, if more favorable to the
officer, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of the Company its affiliates and
their families, and 

• at the Company's sole expense as incurred, the outplacement services provided to similarly situated executives of the
Company but at a level no less favorable than provided to similarly situated executives prior to the change in control, with
an outplacement services provider that is reasonably agreed between the officer and the Company.

        Each CIC Agreement provides that if the payments and benefits to the named executive officer in connection with a change in control
would be subject to an excise tax by reason of Sections 4999 and 280G of the Code, the payments and benefits under the CIC Agreement
will be reduced to the extent necessary to prevent any portion of the officer's change in control-related payments and benefits from
becoming subject to such excise tax, but only if, by reason of that reduction, the net after-tax benefit received by the officer exceeds the net
after-tax benefit that the officer would receive if no reduction was made.

        See the section entitled "Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Quantification of Potential
Payments and Benefits to the Company's Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger" beginning on page 47 of this proxy
statement for an estimate of the value of the severance benefits payable to each of the Company's named executive officers upon a
qualifying termination following the effective time.

Change of Control Employment Agreements with other Executive Officers

        Each of the Company's three executive officers who are not named executive officers is also party to a CIC Agreement the terms of
which are the same in all material respects as the terms of the CIC Agreements with Messrs. Sullivan, Major and Maritz as described
above.

        Based on the assumptions described above under "—Certain Assumptions", the estimated aggregate cash severance payable to the
Company's three executive officers who are not named executive officers upon a qualifying termination following the effective time is
$5,057,639.

Indemnification and Insurance 

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, the Company directors and executive officers will be entitled to certain ongoing
indemnification and coverage under directors' and officers' liability insurance policies following the merger. Such indemnification and
insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance" beginning on
page 70 of this proxy statement.

Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to the Company's Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger 

        The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC's Regulation S-K, which requires
disclosure of information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of the Company that is based on, or otherwise
relates to, the merger. The amounts shown in the table below are estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually
occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table, and do not reflect
certain compensation actions that may occur before completion of the merger. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the following
assumptions were used:

• The relevant price per share of the Company common stock is $28.30, which is the amount of the merger consideration; 

• The effective time is August 11, 2016, which is the assumed date of the closing of the merger solely for purposes of the
disclosure in this section; 

• Each named executive officer experiences a qualifying termination, including a termination by the Company without
"cause" or resignation by the named executive officer for "good reason," as such terms are defined in the relevant Company
plans and agreements, immediately following the assumed effective time of August 11, 2016.

preceding the month in which a change in control occurs) and (ii) the highest annual bonus, and (b) a prorated cash
bonus payment equal to the highest annual bonus multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days in the fiscal year through the date of the qualifying termination of employment and the denominator of which is
365. Such payments are "double trigger" and payable only upon a qualifying termination of employment in
connection with the merger. The estimated amount of each such payment is shown in the following table:

Named Executive Officer  Severance ($)  
Prorated
Bonus ($)  Total ($)  

Edward L. Doheny II   5,840,100  760,596  6,600,696

Sean D. Major   1,545,824  226,489  1,772,313 
Johannes S. Maritz   1,222,816  179,163  1,401,979 

(2) Equity.    Includes estimated value of unvested stock options, unvested restricted share units, and unvested
performance share awards, in each case that are outstanding as of the assumed closing date of August 11, 2016. All
such awards are "single trigger" and will become vested in full and cashed out in a lump sum at the effective time.
The Company and Komatsu have agreed that restricted share unit awards granted after the date of the merger
agreement, including those granted to the named executive officers, will be converted into long-term cash incentive
awards at the effective time and will have "double trigger" vesting, i.e., will vest upon a qualifying termination on a
prorated basis reflecting the portion of the three-year vesting period that has elapsed prior to the termination of
employment, provided that if such termination occurs during the first year of the three-year vesting period a
minimum of one-third of the award will vest. As of the date of this proxy statement, no restricted share unit awards
have been granted to the named executive officers after the date of the merger agreement and therefore no estimated
value is included with respect to such awards. For further details regarding the treatment of the Company equity
awards in connection with the merger, see "Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger—Equity Compensation". The estimated value of the single trigger awards is shown in the following table:

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. holders (as defined
below) of Joy Global common stock whose shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion does not address U.S.
federal income tax consequences with respect to holders other than U.S. holders. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, judicial opinions and administrative rulings and
published positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), each as in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to
change or differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the
statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion is for general information purposes only and does not purport to be
a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the unearned
income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, nor does it address any tax
considerations under state, local or foreign laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax. This
discussion is not binding on the IRS or the courts and, therefore, could be subject to challenge, which could be sustained. No ruling is
intended to be sought from the IRS with respect to the merger.

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax
purposes:

• a citizen or individual resident of the United States; 

• a corporation, or other entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; 

• a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration, and one
or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) such trust has a valid election in
effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or 

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.

        This discussion applies only to U.S. holders of shares of Joy Global common stock who hold such shares as a capital asset within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not purport to consider all
aspects of U.S. federal income

least equal to those that would have been provided under the CIC Agreement absent a termination of employment or,
if more favorable to the officer, as in effect generally at any time thereafter with respect to other peer executives of
the Company its affiliates and their families, and (b) at the Company's sole expense as incurred, the outplacement
services provided to similarly situated executives of the Company but at a level no less favorable than provided to
similarly situated executives prior to the change in control, with a provider that is reasonably agreed between the
officer and the Company. Such benefits are "double trigger" and are provided only upon a qualifying termination of
employment in connection with the merger. The estimated value of these benefits is shown in the following table:

Named Executive Officer  
Welfare

Benefits ($)  Outplacement ($)  Total ($)  
Edward L. Doheny II   75,125  50,000  125,125 
James M. Sullivan   46,160  50,000  96,160

taxation that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in light of its particular circumstances, or that may apply to U.S. holders subject to special
treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, insurance companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign
currencies, traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, U.S.
holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, governmental agencies or instrumentalities,
tax-qualified retirement plans, banks and other financial institutions, mutual funds, certain expatriates, partnerships (or other entities or
arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes), S corporations, or other pass-through entities, or investors in
such partnerships, S corporations or other pass-through entities, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, U.S. holders
who hold shares of common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated transaction, U.S. holders
who will hold (actually or constructively) an equity interest in the surviving corporation immediately after the merger, and U.S. holders
who acquired their shares of common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements). This
discussion also does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of shares of common stock who exercise appraisal
rights in connection with the merger under the DGCL.

        If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
holds shares of Joy Global common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the
partners and the activities of the partnership. If you are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a partner in a partnership holding shares of
Joy Global common stock, you should consult your tax advisor.

        This summary of material U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is not tax
advice. Holders of Joy Global common stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax
consequences to them of the merger, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax, the unearned income
Medicare contribution tax and any other U.S. federal, or state, local, foreign or other tax laws.

Consequences to U.S. Holders

        The receipt of cash by U.S. holders in exchange for shares of Joy Global common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. holder who receives cash in
exchange for shares of Joy Global common stock pursuant to the merger will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if
any, between (1) the amount of cash received and (2) the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in its shares of Joy Global common stock.

        Any such gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if a U.S. holder's holding period in the shares of Joy Global common
stock surrendered in the merger is greater than one year as of the date of the merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate
holders, including individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is
subject to limitations. If a U.S. holder acquired different blocks of Joy Global common stock at different times or different prices, such
U.S. holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with respect to each block of Joy Global common stock.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

        Payments made in exchange for shares of Joy Global common stock pursuant to the merger may be subject, under certain
circumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%). To avoid backup withholding, a non-
corporate U.S. holder that does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return to the applicable withholding agent a
properly completed and executed IRS Form W-9, certifying under penalties of perjury that such U.S. holder is a

Table of Contents

"United States person" (within the meaning of the Code), that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct, and that such U.S.
holder is not subject to backup withholding.

        Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited
against a holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the IRS in a
timely manner.

Regulatory Approvals 

        Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the merger, may not be completed until notifications have been
given and information furnished to the FTC and the Antitrust Division and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied.
Completion of the merger is subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. In accordance
with the merger agreement, Company and Komatsu shall file, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of the merger agreement,
their respective Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the Antitrust Division.

        Completion of the merger is further subject to certain regulatory processes, including the receipt of antitrust clearance and/or approval
or the filing of notices in Austria, Australia, Botswana, Brazil, Canada, China, Chile, Colombia, the European Commission, in case of
referral, Poland, Russia, South Africa and Sweden.

        At any time before or after the expiration of the statutory waiting periods under the HSR Act the FTC or the Antitrust Division may
take action under the antitrust laws, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, to rescind the merger or to conditionally
permit completion of the merger subject to regulatory conditions or other remedies. In addition, non-U.S. regulatory bodies and U.S. state
attorneys general could take action under the antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without
limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may
also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under some circumstances. Although neither Joy Global nor Komatsu believes that
the merger will violate the antitrust laws, there can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or,
if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

        If necessary to obtain the agreed antitrust clearances, Komatsu has agreed, among other things, to take or commit to the sale,
divestiture, license, holding separate or other disposition of, or restriction on, the businesses, assets, properties, product lines or equity
interests of, or changes to the conduct of business of, Joy Global, Komatsu and their respective subsidiaries (including the surviving
corporation and its subsidiaries); provided, however, that Komatsu will not be required to (1) divest or dispose of any asset, product or line
of business of Joy Global, or undertake any limitation on the conduct of Joy Global, Komatsu or their respective affiliates, representing in
excess of $600 million in revenues or (2) offer or agree to the sale, divestiture, hold separate, licensing or disposition of any assets or
businesses of Komatsu or its affiliates or (3) offer or accept any remedies or divestitures consisting of or impeding the use of intellectual
property in the SR Drive Technology, unless Komatsu retains either ownership of or an unrestricted, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free
license to the SR Drive Technology. See the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—Regulatory Approvals."

        "SR Drive Technology" refers to the structure or methods of using or manufacturing any drive system making use of a switched
reluctance motor, as well as all hardware and software components and intellectual property necessary to use the system in operation in
heavy equipment, including but not limited to kinetic energy storage, controller, power source, power conversion and braking components.

        For purposes of the regulatory approvals provisions in the merger agreement, the calculation of revenues for any asset, product, line
of business, or conduct restriction of Joy Global will be made on the basis of revenues reflected in the audited Joy Global consolidated
accounts as of October 30, 2015. In the case of conduct restrictions on Komatsu and its affiliates, the calculation of revenues will be made
on the basis of the revenues of Komatsu's parent company, Komatsu Ltd., as reflected in the audited Komatsu Ltd. consolidated accounts
as of March 31, 2016.

Delisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock 

        If the merger is completed, the Company common stock will be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Certain Litigation Relating to the Merger 

        Several purported class action complaints relating to the merger have been filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Wisconsin on behalf of putative classes of Joy Global's public shareholders (the "federal cases"). The complaints name as
defendants Joy Global and its directors, and one of the complaints (Soffer) also names Komatsu America and Merger Sub. The federal
cases generally allege that Joy Global and its directors breached federal securities laws by failing to disclose material information in the
preliminary form of this proxy statement. The Soffer complaint also alleges that Joy Global's directors violated their fiduciary duties by
entering into the merger agreement after engaging in an unfair process resulting in an unfair price, by improperly seeking to benefit
themselves, and by agreeing to certain "deal protection" terms in the merger agreement. The Soffer complaint alleges that Joy Global,
Komatsu America and Merger Sub aided and abetted these alleged violations of fiduciary duties. The federal cases are: Oduntan v. Joy
Global Inc., et al., Civil Action No. 16-cv-1136, filed August 24, 2016; Soffer v. Doheny, et al., Civil Action No. 16-cv-1148, filed
August 26, 2016; and Gordon v. Joy Global Inc., et al., Case No. 16-cv-1153, filed August 26, 2016. Also on August 26, 2106, a putative
class action, Garfield v. Joy Global Inc., et al., 16CV006588, was filed in the Circuit Court of Wisconsin, Milwaukee County, naming Joy
Global, its directors, Komatsu America, Komatsu Ltd., Goldman Sachs and unnamed Goldman Sachs employees (the "state case"). The
state case alleges that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties by entering into the merger agreement and further that Joy
Global and the individual defendants have failed to disclose material terms concerning the merger. The complaint alleges that Komatsu
America, Komatsu Ltd. and the Goldman Sachs defendants aided and abetted the individual defendants' alleged breaches of fiduciary
duties. Each of the federal cases and the state case seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the merger,
damages and an award of plaintiff's expenses and attorneys' fees. Defendants believe that the claims respectively asserted against them are
without merit.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following is a summary of the material provisions of the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex A and which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. This summary does not purport to be complete and may not
contain all of the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. We encourage you to read carefully the merger
agreement in its entirety, as the rights and obligations of the parties thereto are governed by the express terms of the merger agreement
and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement 

        The following summary of the merger agreement, and the copy of the merger agreement attached as Annex A to this proxy statement,
are intended to provide information regarding the terms of the merger agreement and are not intended to provide any factual information
about Joy Global or modify or supplement any factual disclosures about Joy Global in its public reports filed with the SEC. In particular,
the merger agreement and the related summary are not intended to be, and should not be relied upon as, disclosures regarding any facts
and circumstances relating to Joy Global. The merger agreement contains representations and warranties by and covenants of Joy Global,
Komatsu and Merger Sub which were made only for purposes of that agreement and as of specified dates. The representations, warranties
and covenants in the merger agreement were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement, may be subject to
limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of
allocating contractual risk between the parties to the merger agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to
contractual standards of materiality or material adverse effect applicable to the contracting parties that generally differ from those
applicable to investors. In addition, information concerning the subject matter of the representations, warranties and covenants may change
after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Joy Global's public disclosures.
Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the merger agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants
or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties thereto or any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, the description of the merger agreement below does not purport to describe all of the terms of such
agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Annex A and
is incorporated herein by reference.

        Additional information about Joy Global may be found elsewhere in this proxy statement and Joy Global's other public filings. See
the section entitled "Where You Can Find Additional Information."

Structure of the Merger; Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers 

        At the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with and into Joy Global, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease.
Joy Global will be the surviving corporation in the merger and will continue its corporate existence as a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Komatsu. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub that are in effect immediately before the
effective time will become the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving corporation, although the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws will be amended to reflect the name of the surviving corporation as "Joy Global Inc."

        Except as otherwise determined by Komatsu prior to the effective time, the individuals holding positions as directors of Merger Sub
immediately before the effective time will become the initial directors of the surviving corporation, and the officers of Joy Global as of
immediately prior to the effective time shall be the initial officers of the surviving corporation.

When the Merger Becomes Effective 

        The closing of the merger will take place at 10:00 a.m. local time at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, 51 West
52nd Street, New York, New York, 10019, no later than on the third business day following the day on which the last of the conditions set
forth in the merger agreement to be satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of
the merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with the merger
agreement, or at such other place, date and time as Joy Global and Komatsu may agree in writing.

        On the closing date, Joy Global will file a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The merger will
become effective at such time as the certificate of merger has been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such
later time as is agreed between the parties and specified in the certificate of merger.

        As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to complete the merger in mid-2017. However, completion of the merger is subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the completion of the merger, which are described below and include various regulatory
clearances and approvals, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Joy Global or Komatsu could delay the completion of the
merger, or prevent it from being completed at all. There may be a substantial amount of time between the special meeting and the
completion of the merger. We expect to complete the merger promptly following the receipt of all required approvals.

Effect of the Merger on the Common Stock 

        At the effective time, each share of Joy Global common stock outstanding immediately before the effective time (other than shares
owned by Joy Global, Komatsu or Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries, which will be cancelled, and other than dissenting
shares) will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration. The merger consideration will be $28.30 per share in cash,
without interest, and subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

        At the effective time, each share of Joy Global common stock outstanding immediately before the effective time that is owned or held
in treasury by Joy Global or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries and any shares of Joy Global common stock owned, directly or
indirectly, by Komatsu or Merger Sub, will be cancelled, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange for such cancellation.

        Each share of Merger Sub common stock, $1.00 par value, issued and outstanding immediately before the effective time shall be
converted into one share of common stock, $1.00 par value, of the surviving corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the surviving corporation. From and after the effective time, all certificates representing the common stock of Merger Sub
shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation into which they were
converted.

Withholding Rights 

        Komatsu, Merger Sub, Joy Global, the surviving corporation, and the paying agent will each be entitled to deduct and withhold any
amounts due under applicable tax laws from the amounts that would otherwise become payable under the terms of the merger agreement,
and any such withheld amounts that are timely paid to the appropriate taxing authorities will be treated as having been paid to the person
from whom such amounts were originally deducted and withheld.

Treatment of Company Equity Awards; Stock Purchase Program 

        Stock Options.    At the effective time, each Joy Global stock option that is outstanding as of the effective time, whether vested or
unvested, will be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive a

Table of Contents

cash payment (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (a) the number of shares of Joy Global
common stock subject to such option as of immediately prior to the effective time and (b) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration
over the exercise price per share of such option as of immediately prior to the effective time.

        Company Restricted Share Unit Awards and Company Performance Share Awards.    At the effective time, each Joy Global restricted
share unit award that was granted prior to the date of the merger agreement, each Joy Global restricted share unit award that is held by a
non-employee director (whether granted to such director prior to or after the date of the merger agreement), and each Joy Global
performance share award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time will be cancelled in consideration for the right to
receive a cash payment (without interest and less applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Joy
Global common stock subject to such award as of immediately prior to the effective time and (2) the merger consideration. For each Joy
Global performance share award outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, the number of shares subject to the applicable award
shall be one hundred percent of the "Target Number of Performance Shares" set forth in the award at the time of grant.

        At the effective time, each Joy Global restricted share unit award granted after the date of the merger agreement (other than any such
award granted to a non-employee director), that is outstanding as of immediately before the effective time will be converted into a long-
term incentive award that entitles the holder to receive a fixed amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Joy
Global common stock underlying such award as of immediately prior to the effective time and (2) the merger consideration. Each resulting
long-term incentive award will be subject to the same vesting terms that applied to the corresponding Joy Global restricted share unit
award as of immediately prior to the effective time.

        Employee Stock Purchase Plans.    Joy Global's employee stock purchase plans will be terminated immediately prior to the closing
date. The offering periods under these plans that were ongoing as of the date of the merger agreement will be the final offering periods
under these plans, and will terminate, and all outstanding purchase rights will be exercised, on the earlier of the applicable regularly
scheduled purchase date and the trading date that is five business days prior to the closing date. Participants are prohibited from increasing
their payroll deductions for these plans from those in effect on the date of the merger agreement.

Payment for Common Stock in the Merger 

        Prior to the effective time, Komatsu will irrevocably deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company mutually agreed
upon by Komatsu and Joy Global to act as the paying agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Joy Global common stock, cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate merger consideration. Komatsu shall provide to Joy Global reasonably satisfactory written evidence of the
completion of such deposit. Promptly (and no later than the second business day) after the effective time, the paying agent will mail to
each holder of record of a certificate representing outstanding shares of Joy Global common stock immediately prior to the effective time
(a "certificate") and to each holder of uncertificated shares of Joy Global common stock represented by book entry immediately prior to
the effective time ("book entry shares"), in each case, whose shares were converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, (1) a
letter of transmittal and (2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of certificates or book-entry shares formerly representing shares
of the common stock in exchange for payment of the merger consideration. The letter of transmittal shall specify that the shareholder only
risks losing title to certificates or book entry shares upon delivery of the certificates or book entry shares to the paying agent in a form

shares formerly represented by the surrendered certificate or book entry share (less any amount that may be withheld with respect to any
applicable withholding taxes).

        From and after the effective time, the stock transfer books of Joy Global will be closed and there will be no further transfers thereafter
on Joy Global's records, and any certificates or book-entry shares presented to Joy Global for transfer thereafter shall be canceled against
delivery of the merger consideration payable in respect of the shares of Joy Global common stock represented by such certificate or book-
entry shares.

        The paying agent will invest the aggregate merger consideration deposited with it as directed by Komatsu; provided that such
investment shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations of issuers organized
under the law of a state of the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor's
Ratings Service, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers' acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $10,000,000,000 or in mutual funds investing in such assets. Any interest and other income resulting from any such
investments will be paid to and become income of Komatsu. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments, Komatsu
will promptly replace or restore the cash in the payment fund, so as to ensure that the payment fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient to promptly make such cash payments.

        Any portion of the aggregate merger consideration deposited with the paying agent that remains undistributed to holders of shares of
Joy Global common stock on the date that is six months after the effective time will be delivered to the surviving corporation, upon
demand. Thereafter, any former holder of certificates or book entry shares prior to the merger who has not complied with the exchange and
payment procedures described above may look only to the surviving corporation for payment of the merger consideration.

No Solicitation; Alternative Proposals 

        While the merger is pending, Joy Global has agreed that, subject to certain exceptions described below, Joy Global and its affiliates
and representatives will:

• not, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any company takeover proposal (as
defined below) or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a company takeover proposal; 

• not, directly or indirectly, participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person (other than
Komatsu and its affiliates and its and their respective representatives) any nonpublic information with respect to, or
cooperate in any way with any such person with respect to, any company takeover proposal or any inquiry or proposal that
would reasonably be expected to lead to a company takeover proposal; and 

• immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than Komatsu and its
affiliates and its and their respective representatives) that may be ongoing with respect to a company takeover proposal or
inquiry or proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a company takeover proposal, request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously provided to such persons and terminate all physical and electronic
data room access previously granted to any such persons or their representatives.

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, a "company takeover proposal" means any proposal, indication, interest or offer (whether or not in
writing), from any person (other than Komatsu and its subsidiaries) involving a (1) merger, consolidation, share exchange, joint venture,
other business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Joy Global or any of its subsidiaries
whose revenues, net income or assets, taken together, constitute 15% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of Joy
Global and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (2) sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of
merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity
interests in Joy Global Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of Joy Global or Joy Global subsidiaries representing 15% or
more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of Joy Global and Joy Global subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (3) issuance, sale or

Joy Global, (4) transaction (including any tender offer or exchange offer) in which any person (or the stockholders of any person) would
acquire (in the case of a tender offer or exchange offer, if consummated), directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire
beneficial ownership, or formation of any group that beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 15% or more of
any class of capital stock of Joy Global or (5) any combination of the foregoing.

Receipt of Company Takeover Proposals 

        Notwithstanding the provisions of the merger agreement described above, if at any time after July 21, 2016 and prior to obtaining the
required vote of the Company's stockholders to adopt the merger agreement, Joy Global receives a bona fide written company takeover
proposal from a third party (that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement), and if the Joy
Global board determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
company takeover proposal constitutes or could reasonably

be expected to lead to a superior company proposal (as defined below), then Joy Global and its representatives may take the following
actions:

• furnish, pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to Komatsu for
informational purposes within 24 hours), information (including non-public information) with respect to Joy Global and its
subsidiaries to the person that has made such company takeover proposal and its representatives; provided that Joy Global
must substantially concurrently provide to Komatsu any non-public information concerning Joy Global or any of its
subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its representatives, unless such non-public information has
been previously provided to Komatsu; and 

• participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such company takeover proposal and its representatives
regarding such proposal, including terms of a definitive agreement with respect thereto, and the negotiations of such terms
with the person making such company takeover proposal;

but in each case described in the two preceding bullet points, only if (A) the Joy Global board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to take such action could reasonably likely be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders under applicable law and (B) Joy Global shall have delivered to Komatsu a prior written notice
advising Komatsu that it intends to take such action.

        Joy Global must promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours) notify Komatsu orally and in writing of (1) any company takeover
proposal, any request outside the ordinary course of business for material non-public information relating to Joy Global or its subsidiaries,
and the identity of the person making such proposal or request, and (2) any company intervening event (as defined below) or any facts and
circumstances that would reasonably be expected to lead to a company intervening event. Joy Global must keep Komatsu reasonably
informed of the material terms and status of any company takeover proposal or of the facts and circumstances of any company intervening
event.

        If, at any time prior to obtaining the required vote of the Company's stockholders to adopt the merger agreement, the Joy Global
board determines in good faith, after consultation with independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that a written company
takeover proposal that did not result from a breach of the non-solicitation provision of the merger agreement constitutes a superior
company proposal, then the Joy Global board may terminate the merger agreement with Komatsu, provided that (1) Joy Global must have
given Komatsu at least three business days prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and have provided Komatsu the material
terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making, any such superior company proposal, (2) if requested by Komatsu, Joy
Global must have negotiated with Komatsu in good faith regarding any revision to the merger agreement committed to in writing by
Komatsu, and (3) at the end of such notice period, the Joy Global board must have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of
the merger agreement proposed in writing by Komatsu, and have determined, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that after taking into account any revisions to the merger agreement proposed by Komatsu, the failure to terminate
the merger agreement as a result of such superior company proposal would reasonably likely be inconsistent with the Joy Global board's
fiduciary duties under applicable law. If there are any subsequent changes to the superior company proposal, then the Joy Global board
must provide Komatsu written notice of such changes and the period set forth above is extended an additional two business days.

        The non-solicitation provisions of the merger agreement do not prohibit Joy Global or the Joy Global board from taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of Joy Global a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
or making any disclosure to the stockholders of Joy Global if the Joy Global board determines in good faith that failure to so disclose
would reasonably likely be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law.

Table of Contents

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, a "superior company proposal" means a bona fide written company takeover proposal (provided
that for purposes of this definition, the applicable percentage in the definition of company takeover proposal shall be "50.1%" rather than
"15% or more"), that did not result from, or arise in connection with, any material breach of the merger agreement's no solicitation
provision, and that the Joy Global board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor,
and taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory and other relevant aspects of such a proposal, is (1) reasonably capable of being
completed on the terms proposed and (2) more favorable to the holders of Joy Global Common Stock than the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement with Komatsu (after taking into account any proposed revisions to the terms of the merger agreement that are
committed to in writing by Komatsu).

        A "company intervening event" means a change or effect relating to the Joy Global that (A) is unknown to the Joy Global board as of
July 21, 2016, or if known to the Joy Global board as of such date, the material consequences of which were not known or reasonably
foreseeable to the Joy Global board as of such date, and (B) does not relate to any company takeover proposal or any consequence thereof.

Changes in Board Recommendation 

        The Joy Global board has unanimously recommended that Joy Global stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement. The merger agreement permits the Joy Global board to make a "company adverse recommendation change" in the event that
(i) a company intervening event occurs or (ii) Joy Global receives a superior company proposal that does not result from a breach of the
non-solicitation requirement, and, in each case, if the Joy Global board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor and after taking into account any changes to the terms of the merger agreement proposed by Komatsu during
the three business day period referred to in clause (3) below) that the failure to effect a company adverse recommendation change would
reasonably likely be inconsistent with the Joy Global board's fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        In addition, to make a change of recommendation, the Joy Global board must (1) provide three business days prior written notice to
Komatsu that it is prepared to effect a company adverse recommendation change, which notice shall identify the company intervening
event or describe the material terms and conditions of the superior company proposal; (2) if requested by Komatsu, during the three
business day period after delivery of the notice, negotiate in good faith with Komatsu and its representatives regarding any revisions to the
merger agreement committed to in writing by Komatsu and (3) at the end of such three business day period and taking into account any
changes to the terms of the merger agreement committed to in writing by Komatsu, determine in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that the failure to make such a company adverse recommendation change would reasonably
likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable law. If there are any subsequent changes to the superior
company proposal leading to a company adverse recommendation change, then the Joy Global board must provide Komatsu written notice
of such changes and the period set forth above is extended an additional two business days.

Stockholders' Meeting 

        Joy Global has agreed under the merger agreement to call a meeting of its stockholders to be held as soon as reasonably practicable
after the mailing of this proxy statement. Joy Global shall make an effort to (i) solicit from the stockholders proxies in favor of adopting
the merger agreement and (ii) take all other actions necessary to secure the vote of the stockholders required by applicable law to obtain
approval of the merger. Joy Global may adjourn or postpone the company stockholders meeting only if, as of the time for which such
meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of

Joy Global Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such
meeting, or if on the date of such meeting Joy Global has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to
obtain the required company stockholder approval. Joy Global has also agreed under the merger agreement for the Joy Global board to
recommend to Joy Global's stockholders the adoption of the merger agreement, subject to the provisions of the merger agreement
described above under the section of this proxy statement entitled "—No Solicitation" and "—Changes in Board Recommendation."

Financing 

        There is no financing condition to the merger. Komatsu has represented in the merger agreement that it will have, at the effective
time, immediately available sufficient funds to pay the merger consideration and make all other necessary payments by it in connection
with the merger.

Employee Matters 

        The merger agreement provides that, during the period commencing at the effective time and ending on the first anniversary of the
effective time (the "continuation period"), except as would be inconsistent with applicable law, Komatsu will provide, or will cause the
surviving corporation to provide, to each employee of Joy Global or its subsidiaries who continues to be employed by Komatsu or the
surviving corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries following the effective time (collectively, the "company employees"), and
who, in each case, is not represented by a union, labor organization or works council, (1) a base salary or wage rate that is no less
favorable than that provided to such company employee immediately prior to the effective time and (2) aggregate incentive compensation
opportunities and employee benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those cash-based and equity-based incentive
compensation opportunities and employee benefits provided to such company employee immediately prior to the effective time (but not
taking into account any retention program established pursuant to the merger agreement and recognizing that equity-based compensation
may be replaced with other forms of long-term compensation). Furthermore, during the one-year period immediately following the
effective time, Komatsu shall, and shall cause the surviving corporation to, provide each company employee in certain jurisdictions who
experiences a termination of employment other than for cause with the surviving corporation, Komatsu or any of their subsidiaries with
severance benefits that are no less favorable than those set forth in the severance plan applicable to such jurisdiction as in effect on the date
of the merger agreement.

        Following the effective time of the merger, subject to certain customary exclusions, Komatsu and the surviving corporation will:
(1) use commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause any preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under plans of
Komatsu, the surviving corporation or a subsidiary to be waived with respect to company employees to the extent such limitation would
have been waived or satisfied under the Joy Global benefit plan in which such company employee participated immediately prior to the
merger, and (B) credit each company employee under these plans for co-payments or deductibles incurred in the plan year in which such
company employee is first eligible to participate and cause such credited expenses to count toward any annual or lifetime limits, and
(2) recognize service with Joy Global and its subsidiaries (and any predecessors thereof) for all purposes under these plans, including
eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals.

        The merger agreement further provides that Joy Global may establish a cash-based retention program in the aggregate amount of
$5 million to promote retention, to incentivize efforts to consummate the closing and to provide for a transition for a reasonable period of
time following the closing (the "retention program"). Awards under the retention program may be allocated by the Chief Executive Officer
of Joy Global (or his designee(s)) among Joy Global employees; provided that no awards may be granted to an individual who is covered
by a change in control agreement and any

award in excess of $100,000 shall be subject to the prior approval by Komatsu, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
The merger agreement provides that each retention award will vest and be paid fifty percent immediately prior to the effective time,
twenty-five percent on the date that is ninety days after the effective time and twenty-five percent on the date that is one hundred eighty
days after the effective time, subject to continued employment through the applicable payment date, except that any unpaid portion of the
award will vest in full and be paid on an earlier qualifying termination, subject to the employee providing a general release of claims
against Joy Global and its affiliates. If a retention award under the retention program is forfeited by a participant prior to the effective time,
the Chief Executive Officer of Joy Global (or his designee(s)) may reallocate the retention award to existing employees or new hires of Joy
Global and its subsidiaries. Joy Global may enter into a retention letter agreement with each recipient of a retention award under the
retention program setting forth the amount and terms of such award.

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, Joy Global may pay to each employee of Joy Global and its subsidiaries actively employed on the
last day of Joy Global's 2016 fiscal year (ending October 28, 2016), a full bonus under the applicable annual bonus plan in respect of Joy
Global's 2016 fiscal year based on actual performance during such fiscal year, such payment to be made at the earlier of (1) immediately
prior to the effective time, and (2) in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. Joy Global may establish awards for
employees under the applicable annual bonus plan in respect of Joy Global's 2017 fiscal year (ending October 27, 2017) and the related
performance goals, in each case, in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice. If the effective time occurs during
Joy Global's 2017 fiscal year, Komatsu shall pay, or cause to be paid, to each company employee who participated in an annual bonus plan
immediately prior to the effective time and who experiences a qualifying termination at or following the effective time and prior to
payment of such bonus (subject to the employee providing a general release of claims against Joy Global and its affiliates, including Joy
Global personnel, in the form used by Joy Global in the ordinary course) a bonus equal to the product obtained by multiplying (a) the
company employee's full year bonus entitlement under all applicable annual bonus plans for Joy Global's 2017 fiscal year based on actual
performance, and (b) a fraction (not to exceed 1), the numerator of which equals the number of days that have elapsed during such fiscal
year through the date of the qualifying termination and the denominator of which equals 365, with such bonus being paid at the same time
as bonuses to company employees who remain in the employ of Joy Global, but in any event not later than the 15th day of the third month
following the later of (i) the end of calendar year of the qualifying termination and (ii) the end of Joy Global's fiscal year in which the
qualifying termination occurs.

Efforts to Complete the Merger 

        Joy Global, Komatsu and Merger Sub have agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the conditions to the closing
to be satisfied as promptly as reasonably practicable, including (i) making all necessary filings with governmental entities or third parties,
(ii) obtaining the required consents and all other third-party consents that are necessary to consummate the merger, (iii) obtaining the
required statutory approvals and all other consents of governmental entities that are necessary to consummate the merger, (iv) avoiding the
entry, enactment or application of any law, judgment, or other legal restraint that might impede or delay consummation of the merger and
(v) executing and delivering any additional instruments that are necessary to consummate the merger. Komatsu shall be responsible for
100% of the fees, costs and expenses (except for the fees, costs and expenses of Joy Global's advisors), including any filing fees,
associated with any filings or consents contemplated by the merger agreement.

        Joy Global and Komatsu must also, if necessary to obtain the required or advisable antitrust approvals, (1) defend through litigation
any claim asserted in any court that could impede the closing, but only through the completion of a preliminary or permanent injunction
hearing in the U.S., and, in

other jurisdictions, only until the time that continuing to do so would no longer reasonably likely lead to the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent to closing and (2) divest, license or otherwise dispose of any of Joy Global's assets, product lines or businesses, or agree to any
conduct restrictions, that produced revenues in the aggregate not exceeding $600 million. Komatsu is not required (a) to sell, divest or hold
separate any of Komatsu's assets or business (as opposed to Joy Global's assets and business) or (b) to divest intellectual property in the
SR Drive Technology, unless permitted to retain ownership of, or a worldwide royalty-free, unrestricted license to the SR Drive
Technology.

Indemnification and Insurance 

        Komatsu and Merger Sub have agreed that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the effective time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement), now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the
case may be, of Joy Global or any of its subsidiaries (which we refer to as the "indemnified parties") as provided in Joy Global's or any of
its subsidiaries' governing organizational documents, each as in effect on July 21, 2016, will survive the merger and continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of not less than six years after the effective time, Komatsu will cause the surviving
corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, the indemnified parties with respect to all acts or omissions
by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the effective time, to the fullest extent provided by the organizational documents of
Joy Global and its subsidiaries and applicable law.

        In addition, Komatsu will obtain, or cause the surviving corporation to obtain, for a period of not less than six years after the effective
time, for the indemnified parties who are insured under Joy Global's directors' and officers' insurance and indemnification policy, an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the effective time that is no less favorable
than the existing policy of Joy Global, with certain qualifications.

Coordination on Litigation 

        Joy Global, Komatsu, and Merger Sub have each agreed to promptly notify the other parties in writing of any stockholder litigation or
other litigation or proceedings arising from the merger agreement or the merger that is brought against such party or any of its Affiliates or
members of its board of directors ("Transaction Litigation"). Each party shall keep the other parties informed on the reasonably current
status of any Transaction Litigation (including by promptly furnishing to the other parties and their representatives such information
relating to such litigation or proceedings as may be reasonably requested). Joy Global shall give Komatsu the opportunity to participate in
the defense and settlement of any Transaction Litigation. No compromise or full or partial settlement of any Transaction Litigation shall be
agreed to by Joy Global or its affiliates or members of the Joy Global board without Komatsu's prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Other Covenants and Agreements 

        The merger agreement also contains additional covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to the filing of this proxy
statement, covenants relating to regulatory filings and approvals, reporting requirements under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the
treatment of certain indebtedness and delisting and deregistration of the Joy Global common stock, and public announcements with respect
to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

breach by such party of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement of such party set forth in the
merger agreement; or

Global stockholders meeting or at any adjournment or postponement of the Joy Global stockholders meeting; or

Parent Termination Fee 

        Komatsu will pay Joy Global a termination fee in an amount equal to $150 million in immediately available funds if the merger
agreement is terminated in the following circumstances:

• if either Komatsu or Joy Global terminates the merger agreement because the merger was not completed before the end
date and, at the time of the termination, the required regulatory approvals have not been received (and all other conditions
to closing are satisfied), or because the transaction is enjoined in connection with any required regulatory approval; or 

• if the merger agreement is terminated by Joy Global because Komatsu has breached certain of its covenants and obligations
under the merger agreement relating to seeking to obtain the required regulatory approvals and such breach results or
would be reasonably likely to result in the failure of the antitrust-related closing conditions to be satisfied.

Delisting and Deregistration of Company Common Stock 

        If the merger is completed, the Company common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), and
deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").

Limitation on Remedies 

        In the event of the termination of the merger agreement pursuant to the provisions described in the section entitled "—Termination,"
and if a termination fee is due and payable, from and after the termination of the merger agreement and payment of the termination fee in
full pursuant to the merger agreement, Joy Global, Komatsu and Merger Sub (as applicable) will have no further liability of any kind for
any reason in connection with the merger agreement or its termination, except for any liability arising from a willful breach of the merger
agreement. The payment of the termination fee will be considered liquidated damages and will be the recipient's sole and exclusive remedy
for any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses suffered or incurred by the
recipient. The parties expressly waive and relinquish any other right, remedy or recourse, provided that regardless of whether a party is
obligated to pay a termination fee, nothing in the merger agreement releases such a party from liability for a willful breach of the merger
agreement. In no event will any party be entitled to payment of a termination fee on more than one occasion.

Amendment and Modification 

        Any provision of the merger agreement may be amended by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. No
amendment shall be made after the effective time. Before the receipt of Joy Global stockholder approval, no amendment shall require the
approval of the stockholders of Komatsu or Joy Global. After the receipt of Joy Global stockholder approval, and before the effective time,
no amendment that by law requires further approval by Joy Global's stockholders is permitted to be made without the further approval of
such stockholders.

        At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant to the merger agreement, (c) waive compliance with any covenants and agreements contained herein, subject to stockholder
approval if after the receipt of company stockholder approval, or (d) waive the satisfaction of any of the conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such party. The failure of any party to the merger agreement to assert any of its rights under the merger agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

Jurisdiction; Specific Enforcement 

        The parties acknowledged and agreed that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of the merger
agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It was accordingly agreed that, at any time prior to the valid termination of the
merger agreement under the terms and subject to the limitations therein, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of the merger agreement,
including the right of a party to cause each other party to consummate the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, in certain agreed courts (and each party to the merger agreement waived any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties
further agreed not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason,
nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. If any party brings any claim to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of the merger agreement when expressly available to such party pursuant
to the terms of the merger agreement, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary therein, the end date shall automatically be extended
by the period of time between the commencement of such claim and the date on which such claim is fully and finally resolved. All claims
arising from, under or in connection with the merger agreement shall be raised to and exclusively determined by the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), to whose jurisdiction and venue the parties
irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit. Each party to the merger agreement irrevocably and unconditionally waived any
objection to the laying of venue of claim arising out of the merger agreement in such court and further irrevocably and unconditionally
waived and agreed not to plead or claim in any such court that any such claim brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each party further agreed that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the
respective addresses set forth in the merger agreement shall be effective service of process for any claim brought against such party in any
such court.

ADVISORY VOTE ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION
(PROPOSAL 2) 

        As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, the Company is providing its
stockholders with a separate advisory (non-binding) vote to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the
Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger, as described in the table entitled "Quantification of Potential
Payments and Benefits to the Company's Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger" under "The Merger (Proposal 1)—
Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger," including the footnotes to the table and related narrative
discussion.

        The Joy Global board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of the Company approve the following resolution:

"RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection
with the merger, and the agreement or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, in
each case as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the table in the section entitled "The Merger (Proposal 1)—
Interests of the Company's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to
the Company's Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Merger", including the footnotes to the table and the related
narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED."

        The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the named
executive officer merger-related compensation proposal and vice versa. Because the vote on the named executive officer merger-related
compensation proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either the Company or Komatsu. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is
adopted and the merger is completed, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto under the
applicable compensation agreements and arrangements, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of the Company's
stockholders.

        The above resolution approving the merger-related compensation of the Company's named executive officers on an advisory basis
requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present at the meeting (in person or represented by
proxy) and entitled to vote thereon.

        The Joy Global board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Joy Global vote "FOR" the named executive officer
merger-related compensation proposal.

VOTE ON ADJOURNMENT (PROPOSAL 3) 

        The Company's stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give the Joy Global board authority to adjourn the
special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement,
if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement or in the absence of
a quorum. If this adjournment proposal is approved, the special meeting could be adjourned by the Joy Global board to any date. In
addition, the Joy Global board could postpone the special meeting before it commences. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Joy Global
may only postpone or adjourn the Joy Global stockholders' meeting (1) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the
required vote of the Company's stockholders to adopt the merger agreement or (2) for the absence of a quorum. If the special meeting is
adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke
them at any time before their use. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you sign
and return a proxy and you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement but do not indicate a
choice on the adjournment proposal, your shares of common stock will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal.

        The Company does not anticipate calling a vote on this proposal if Proposal 1 is approved by the requisite number of shares of
common stock at the special meeting.

        The vote on the adjournment proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
Accordingly, you may vote to approve the proposal to approve and adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the adjournment
proposal and vice versa.

        Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present at
the meeting (in person or represented by proxy) and entitled to vote thereon.

        The Joy Global board unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Joy Global vote "FOR" the adjournment proposal,
if a vote on such proposal is called.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 

        The following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of August 4, 2016 by:
(1) each of our directors; (2) each of our named executive officers; (3) all of our directors and executive officers as a group; and (4) each
person, or group of affiliated persons, known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock. Unless otherwise indicated,
the persons or entities identified in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned
by them, subject to applicable community property laws.

        Information with respect to beneficial ownership has been furnished by each director and executive officer. With respect to beneficial
owners of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, information is based on information filed with the SEC. We have determined
beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons
who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities. In addition, the rules require inclusion of
shares of common stock issuable pursuant to Company equity awards within 60 days after August 4, 2016. These shares are deemed to be
outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding the Company equity awards for the purpose

ownership for other purposes.

Except as noted below, none of the shares shown as owned by directors or executive officers have been pledged as
collateral.

Named executive officers and directors also hold restricted stock units that are not included in the beneficial
ownership table because vesting will not occur within 60 days of August 4, 2016. The amounts of restricted stock
units held by named executive officers and directors are described elsewhere in this proxy statement.

The amounts above include the following number of shares such person or group may acquire upon (i) exercise of
stock options exercisable within 60 days of August 4, 2016, (ii) shares such person or group has a right to acquire
upon settlement of deferred stock units, and (iii) shares to be distributed to such person or group upon settlement of

APPRAISAL RIGHTS 

        Under the DGCL, you have the right to dissent from the merger and to receive payment in cash for the "fair value" of your shares of
common stock (exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger) as determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery, together with interest, if any, as determined by the Court, in lieu of the consideration you would otherwise be
entitled to pursuant to the merger agreement. These rights are known as appraisal rights. Stockholders electing to exercise appraisal rights
must comply with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL in order to perfect their rights. Strict compliance with the statutory
procedures is required to perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law.

        The following is intended as a brief summary of the material provisions of the Delaware statutory procedures required to be followed
by a stockholder in order to dissent from the merger and perfect appraisal rights. This summary, however, is not a complete statement of all
applicable requirements and is qualified in its entirety by reference to Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which appears in Annex C
to this proxy statement. Failure to precisely follow any of the statutory procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL may result in the
loss or waiver of your appraisal rights. All references in this summary to a "stockholder" are to the record holder of shares of common
stock of the Company unless otherwise indicated.

        Only a holder of record of shares of Company common stock on the record date for the Company special meeting is entitled to assert
appraisal rights for such shares of common stock registered in that holder's name. To be effective, a demand for appraisal by a stockholder
must be made by, or on behalf of, such stockholder of record. The demand should set forth, fully and correctly, the stockholder's name as it
appears, with respect to shares evidenced by certificates, on his or her stock certificate, or, with respect to book-entry shares, on the stock
ledger. Beneficial owners who do not also hold their shares of Company common stock of record may not directly make appraisal
demands to the Company. Beneficial owners of shares of common stock who do not also hold such shares of record may have the
registered owner, such as a broker, bank or other nominee, submit the required demand in respect of those shares. If shares of common
stock are owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, execution of a demand for appraisal should
be made in that capacity, and if the shares of common stock are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy
in common, the demand should be executed by or for all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more
joint owners, may execute the demand for appraisal on behalf of a stockholder of record; however, the agent must identify the record
owner or owners and expressly disclose the fact that, in executing the demand, he or she is acting as agent for the record owner. In the
event a record owner, such as a broker, who holds shares of common stock as a nominee for others, exercises his or her right of appraisal
with respect to the shares of common stock held for one or more beneficial owners, while not exercising this right for other beneficial
owners, we recommend that the written demand state the number of shares of common stock as to which appraisal is sought. Where no
number of shares is expressly mentioned, we will presume that the demand covers all shares held in the name of the record owner. If you
hold your shares of common stock in a brokerage account or in other nominee form and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should
consult with your broker or the other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by the
nominee.

        Section 262 of the DGCL requires that stockholders for whom appraisal rights are available be notified not less than 20 days before
the stockholders' meeting to vote on the merger in connection with which appraisal rights will be available. A copy of Section 262 of the
DGCL must be included with such notice. This proxy statement constitutes our notice to the Company's stockholders of the availability of
appraisal rights in connection with the merger in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and a copy of the full text
of Section 262 of the DGCL is attached hereto as Annex C. If you wish to consider exercising your appraisal rights, you should carefully
review the text of

Table of Contents

Section 262 of the DGCL contained in Annex C to this proxy statement and should consult your legal advisor since failure to timely and
properly comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights under the DGCL.

        If you elect to demand appraisal of your shares, you must satisfy each of the following conditions:

• You must deliver to us a written demand for appraisal of your shares before the vote with respect to the merger is taken. A
demand for appraisal will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the Company of the identity of the stockholder and that such
stockholder intends thereby to demand appraisal of such stockholder's shares of common stock. This written demand for
appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote abstaining from or voting against the adoption and
approval of the merger agreement and the merger. Voting against or failing to vote for the adoption and approval of the
merger agreement and the merger by itself does not constitute a demand for appraisal within the meaning of Section 262 of
the DGCL. The demand must reasonably inform us of the identity of the stockholder and the intention of the stockholder to
demand appraisal of his, her or its shares. A stockholder's failure to make a written demand before the vote with respect to
the merger is taken will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights. 

• You must not vote in favor of, or consent in writing to, the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the merger
If you sign and return a proxy card that does not contain voting instructions or submit a proxy by telephone or through the
internet that does not contain voting instructions, you will effectively waive your appraisal rights because such shares
represented by the proxy will, unless the proxy is revoked, be voted for the adoption of the merger agreement. Therefore, a
stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the merger agreement and
the merger or abstain from voting on the merger agreement and the merger. 

• You must continue to hold your shares of common stock from the date of making the demand through the effective date of
the merger. Therefore, a stockholder who is the record holder of shares of common stock on the date the written demand for
appraisal is made but who thereafter transfers the shares before the effective date of the merger will lose any right to
appraisal with respect to such shares.

        If you fail to comply with any of these conditions and the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive the merger
consideration, without interest thereon and less any withholding taxes, but you will have no appraisal rights with respect to your shares of
common stock. At any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has demanded an appraisal, and
who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party, has the right to withdraw such stockholder's
demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration specified by the merger agreement for his or her shares of common stock;
after this period, the stockholder may withdraw such demand for appraisal only with the consent of the surviving corporation.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed as to any stockholder without
the prior approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just;
provided, however, that any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party will
maintain the right to withdraw its demand for appraisal and to accept the merger consideration that such holder would have received
pursuant to the merger agreement within 60 days after the effective date of the merger.

        Within 10 days after the effective date of the merger, the surviving corporation (i.e., Joy Global) must give written notice that the
merger has become effective to each stockholder who has properly filed a written demand for appraisal and who did not vote in favor of
the merger agreement and the merger. Within 120 days after the effective time, but not thereafter, either the surviving corporation or

any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights
may file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders
entitled to appraisal. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of
such person may, in such person's own name, file the petition described in the previous sentence. Upon the filing of the petition by a
stockholder, service of a copy of such petition shall be made upon the surviving corporation. The surviving corporation has no obligation
to file such a petition in the event there are dissenting stockholders. Accordingly, the failure of a stockholder to file such a petition within
the period specified could nullify the stockholder's previously written demand for appraisal. There is no present intent on the part of the
Company to file an appraisal petition, and stockholders seeking to exercise appraisal rights should not assume that the Company will file
such a petition or that the Company will initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of such shares. Accordingly, stockholders
who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate any petitions necessary for the perfection of their appraisal rights within the time
periods and in the manner prescribed in Section 262 of the DGCL.

        The costs of the appraisal action may be determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and made payable by the parties as the Court
deems equitable. The Court also may order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with an
appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts utilized in the appraisal proceeding,
be charged pro rata against the value of all of the shares entitled to appraisal.

        If a petition for appraisal is duly filed by a stockholder and a copy of the petition is delivered to the surviving corporation, the
surviving corporation will then be obligated, within 20 days after receiving service of a copy of the petition, to provide the Delaware Court
of Chancery with a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares
and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving corporation. The Register in Chancery, if
so ordered by the Delaware Court of Chancery, must give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered
or certified mail to the surviving corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice must
also be given by one or more publications at least one week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published
in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems advisable. The forms of the notices by
mail and by publication must be approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and the costs thereof will be borne by the surviving
corporation. After notice to stockholders who demanded appraisal of their shares of Company common stock, the Delaware Court of
Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing upon the petition, and to will determine the stockholders who have complied with
Section 262 of the DGCL and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Delaware Court of Chancery may require the
stockholders who have demanded appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their stock certificates
to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; if any stockholder fails to comply with that
direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to that stockholder. If immediately before the merger or
consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed
on a national securities exchange, the Delaware Court of Chancery shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are
otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the
class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of
shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any stockholder who has complied with Section 262 of the DGCL will, upon
written request to the surviving corporation, be entitled to receive a written statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not
voted in favor of the merger

agreement and the merger and with respect to which demands for appraisal rights have been received and the aggregate number of holders
of such shares. A person who is the beneficial owner of shares of common stock held in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such
person may, in such person's own name, request from the corporation the statement described in the previous sentence. Such written
statement will be mailed to the requesting stockholder within 10 days after such written request is received by the surviving corporation or
within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later.

        After determination of the stockholders entitled to appraisal of their shares of common stock, the Delaware Court of Chancery will
appraise the shares, determining their fair value exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger, together with interest, if any. Unless the Delaware Court of Chancery in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,
and except as provided in this section, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment will be
compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to
time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of
judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case
interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the
surviving corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Delaware Court of Chancery may, in its
discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal before the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder
whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving corporation and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the
Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not
entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. When the fair value is determined, the Delaware Court of Chancery will direct
the payment of such value, with interest thereon, if any, by the surviving corporation to the stockholders entitled to receive the same, upon
surrender by such stockholders of their certificates and book-entry shares.

        In determining the fair value of the shares of common stock and, if applicable, interest, the Delaware Court of Chancery is required to
take into account all relevant factors. Accordingly, such determination could be based upon considerations other than, or in addition to, the
market value of the shares of Company common stock, including, among other things, market value, asset value, dividends, earnings
prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on
future prospects of the merged corporation. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated, among other things, that
"proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise
admissible in court" should be considered in an appraisal proceeding.

        Section 262 of the DGCL provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or
expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow
exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value," but rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from
such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Delaware Supreme Court also stated that "elements of future value, including the
nature of the enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be
considered."

        You should be aware that the fair value of your shares of common stock as determined under Section 262 of the DGCL could be more
than, the same as, or less than the value that you are entitled to receive under the terms of the merger agreement and that an opinion of an
investment banking firm as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the consideration payable in a sale transaction,

such as the merger, is not an opinion as to, and does not otherwise address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL.

        Moreover, we do not anticipate offering more than the per share merger consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights
and reserve the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that, for purposes of Section 262 of the DGCL, the "fair value" of a share of
common stock is less than the per share merger consideration.

        Any stockholder who has duly demanded and perfected an appraisal in compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not, after the
effective time, be entitled to vote shares subject to that demand for any purpose or to receive payments of dividends or any other
distribution with respect to those shares, other than with respect to payment as of a record date before the effective time; however, if no
petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, or if the stockholder delivers a written withdrawal of
his or her demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the terms of the merger within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
thereafter with the written approval of the Company, then the right of that stockholder to appraisal will cease. In view of the complexity of
Section 262 of the DGCL, stockholders who may wish to dissent from the merger and pursue appraisal rights should consult their legal
advisors.

MULTIPLE STOCKHOLDERS SHARING ONE ADDRESS 

        In accordance with Rule 14a-3(e)(1) under the Exchange Act, one proxy statement will be delivered to two or more stockholders who
share an address, unless the Company has received contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders. Each stockholder will
receive a separate proxy card. The Company will deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of the proxy statement to a
stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the proxy statement was delivered. Requests for additional copies of the proxy
statement should be directed to the Company in care of the Secretary at Joy Global Inc., 100 E. Wisconsin Avenue, Suite 2780,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202, or by calling (414) 319-8500. In addition, stockholders who share a single address, but receive multiple
copies of the proxy statement, may request that in the future they receive a single copy by contacting the Company at the address and
phone number set forth in the prior sentence.

SUBMISSION OF STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        Depending on if and when the merger is completed, we may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2017. If the merger is
completed, we will not hold an annual meeting of stockholders in 2018. If the merger is not completed, you will continue to be entitled to
attend and participate in our annual meetings of stockholders. If any such annual meeting is held, stockholder proposals will be eligible for
consideration for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy for such annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with Rule 14a-
8 under the Exchange Act and our bylaws.

        If you would like to submit a proposal for us to include in the proxy statement for our 2017 annual meeting, you must comply with
Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and the advance notice provisions of our bylaws. You must also make sure that we receive your
proposal at our executive offices (sent c/o Secretary) by October 6, 2016. Any stockholder proposal included in our proxy statement will
also be included on our form of proxy so that stockholders can indicate how they wish to vote their shares on the proposal.

        If you would like to recommend a person for consideration as a nominee for election as a director at our 2017 annual meeting, you
must comply with the advance notice provisions of our bylaws. These provisions require that we receive your nomination at our executive
offices (sent c/o Secretary) no earlier than November 8, 2016 and no later than December 8, 2016.

        If you would like to present a proposal at our 2017 annual meeting without including it in our proxy statement, you must comply with
the advance notice provisions of our bylaws. These provisions require that we receive your proposal at our executive offices (sent c/o
Secretary) no earlier than November 8, 2016, and no later than December 8, 2016.

State of the State of Delaware the certificate of merger relating to the Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") executed and acknowledged in

pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(ii):

        (1)   a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to

proper form for transfer or (B) the Book-Entry Share is properly transferred; and

        (2)   the Person requesting such payment shall (A) pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the

satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

        (vi)  At any time after the Effective Time until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share as
contemplated by Section 2.01(a)(ii). No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-

respect of all such funds) which remains undistributed to the former holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon expiration
of the period ending six (6) months after the Effective Time. Thereafter, any former holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares

losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall diminish the rights of any of the Company's stockholders to receive the
Merger Consideration or any other payment as provided herein. To the extent there are losses with respect to such investments or
the Payment Fund diminishes for any other reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate funds
required to be paid pursuant to the terms hereof, Parent shall reasonably and promptly replace or restore the cash in the Payment
Fund, so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.

        (f)    No Liability.    None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned

Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. Amounts so deducted and withheld shall be timely paid over to the

relevant, shall provide advance notice of any requirement to withhold and deduct Taxes.

        (h)    Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.    If any Certificate formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock has

underlying the Company Rollover RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Merger
Consideration. Each Cash LTI Award shall be subject to the same vesting terms that applied to the corresponding Company
Rollover RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The portion of each Cash LTI Award that becomes

Merger and who are entitled to demand and have properly demanded their rights to be paid the fair value of such shares of

converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01 and Section 2.02, and the holders of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any
such holder fails to perfect or otherwise effectively waives, withdraws or loses such right, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon

        SECTION 3.06    Company Reports; Financial Statements.     

        (a)   The Company has furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits and
other information incorporated therein) required to be furnished or filed by the Company with the SEC since January 1, 2013 (such
documents, together with all exhibits, financial statements, including the Company Financial Statements, and schedules thereto and
all information incorporated therein by reference, but excluding the Proxy Statement, being collectively referred to as the
"Company Reports"). Each Company Report (i) at the time furnished or filed, complied in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (including the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such
Company Report and (ii) did not at the time it was filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the date of
this Agreement, then at the time of such filing or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments
received in writing from the SEC with respect to any of the Company Reports, and, to the Company's Knowledge, none of the
Company Reports is the subject of any ongoing review by the SEC. Each of the consolidated financial statements of the Company
included in the Company Reports (the "Company Financial Statements") complied at the time it was filed as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited
quarterly financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods and as of
the dates involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated
financial position of the Company and the Company's consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments).

        (b)   Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability of any nature except liabilities (i) reflected or

Subsidiaries included in the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof, (ii) incurred in the ordinary course of business after
October 30, 2015, (iii) incurred in connection with the Merger or any other transaction or agreement contemplated by this
Agreement or (iv) that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

        (c)   The Company maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as
applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance
(i) regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures of Company and its Subsidiaries are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and the Board, and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of Company's and its Subsidiaries' assets that would reasonably be expected to have a material effect on Company's
financial statements.

        (d)   The Company maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange
Act that are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported in all material respects on a timely basis to the individuals

promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the good-faith
judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel) failure to so disclose would reasonably likely be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law.

        (g)   For purposes of this Agreement:

          (i)  "Company Takeover Proposal" means any proposal, indication, interest or offer (whether or not in writing), from
any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) involving a (1) merger, consolidation, share exchange, joint venture,
other business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries whose revenues, net income or assets, taken together, constitute 15% or more of the
consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (2) sale,
lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange,
other business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other equity interests in a Company
Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or assets of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries representing 15% or more
of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(3) issuance, sale or other disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) or group of
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities)

offer) in which any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) would acquire (in the case of a tender offer or exchange
offer, if consummated), directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or
formation of any group that beneficially owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 15% or more of any class
of capital stock of the Company or (5) any combination of the foregoing.

         (ii)  "Superior Company Proposal" means a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal (provided that for
purposes of this definition, the applicable percentage in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal shall be "50.1%"
rather than "15% or more"), that did not result from, or arise in connection with, any material breach of Section 5.02, and
that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor,
and taking into account the legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such Company Takeover Proposal, the
conditionality of and contingencies related to such proposal, the expected timing and risk of completion, the identity of the
Person making such proposal and such other factors that are deemed relevant by the Company Board, is (1) reasonably
capable of being completed on the terms proposed and (2) more favorable to the holders of Company Common Stock than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any proposed revisions to the terms of this
Agreement that are committed to in writing by Parent (including pursuant to Section 5.02(c) )).

inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Company's stockholders or at
the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

        (c)   The Company shall promptly notify Parent after the receipt of any comments from the SEC with respect to, or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to, the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Affiliates and Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand.

that the SEC has no further comments on the Proxy Statement.

         (ii)  The Company shall file the Proxy Statement in definitive form with the SEC and cause such definitive Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC advises the
Company that the SEC has no further comments on the Proxy Statement; and

the Company Board Recommendation in the preliminary and definitive Proxy Statements.

Prior to filing the Proxy Statement in preliminary form with the SEC, responding to any comment from the SEC with respect to, or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to, the Proxy Statement or mailing the Proxy Statement in definitive form to the
stockholders of the Company, the Company shall provide Parent with an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response and consider in good faith any of Parent's comments thereon. Each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the
SEC advise the Company, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement, that the SEC has no
further comments on the Proxy Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall also take any other action (except for qualifying to do
business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any

Effective Time.

release or other public statement that is consistent in all material respects with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by a Party in accordance with this Agreement, including in investor conference calls, SEC Filings, Q&As or other

shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment on, and consider any comments of
the other in good faith before issuing, any press release or any other written public statement with respect to this Agreement or the Merger
without the other's consent; provided, however, if a Party reasonably concludes such press release or written public statement may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system, such Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other Party before issuing
such press release or making any written public statement to the extent permitted by such applicable Law, court process or obligations. The
Company and Parent agree that the initial press release to be issued by each such Party (or in the case of Parent, by the Guarantor) with
respect to this Agreement or Merger shall be in a form mutually agreed to by the Parties. Nothing in this Section 6.07 shall limit the ability

or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Company Indemnified Party" and together,
the "Company Indemnified Parties") as provided in the Organizational Documents of the Company and each Subsidiary of the
Company shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of not
less than six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
and advance expenses to, the Company Indemnified Parties with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such
at any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent provided by the Organizational Documents of the Company or the
Organizational Documents for each Subsidiary of the Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement and applicable Law.

        (b)   Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.09(a), from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law: (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Company Indemnified Party from and against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, penalties, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement (including, in each case, any interest or assessments thereon) in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arises out of or pertains to any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Company Indemnified Party's
capacity as a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) pay the
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of any Company Indemnified Party incurred in connection with any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Company Indemnified Party to
repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified, in
each case, to the extent that such Persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of this
Agreement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the Company or the
Organizational Documents for each Subsidiary of the Company or applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
Indemnified Parties as a group may retain only one law firm to represent them (and local counsel in each necessary jurisdiction)
with respect to each such matter unless there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant
issue between the positions of any two or more Company Indemnified Parties.

        (c)   For a period of six years after the Closing and at all times subject to applicable Law, (i) the Organizational Documents of
the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification of and
advancement of expenses to Company Indemnified Parties for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth
in the Company Articles and the Company Bylaws and (ii) Parent shall not (and shall not cause or permit the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or any of Parent's other Subsidiaries or Affiliates to) amend or modify in any way adverse to
the Company Indemnified Parties, or to the beneficiaries thereof, the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expense
provisions set forth in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to make them less favorable

and its Subsidiaries. In addition, Parent shall provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than
six years after the Effective Time, the Company Indemnified Parties who are insured under the Company's directors' and officers'
insurance and indemnification policy with an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at

annual premium for the D&O Insurance in excess of 250% of the annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for
such insurance; provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage at any time exceed such amount, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy which, in its good faith determination, provides the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company may and at
Parent's request shall purchase a "tail" directors' and officers' insurance and indemnification policy; provided that payment for
insurance coverage provided by such "tail" directors' and officers' insurance policy shall not exceed 250% of the annual premium
paid as of the date hereof by the Company. Any such "tail" directors' and officers' insurance policy will satisfy Parent's obligations
under this Section 6.09(c) to provide D&O Insurance.

        (d)   The Company Indemnified Parties to whom this Section 6.09 applies shall be express third-party beneficiaries of this
Section 6.09. The provisions of this Section 6.09 are intended to be for the express benefit of each Company Indemnified Party and
his or her successors, heirs and representatives.

        (e)   This Section 6.09 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Company
Indemnified Parties and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such other Person or the successors and assigns of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to its obligations set forth in this Section 6.09.

        SECTION 6.10    Employee Matters.     

        (a)   During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the one year anniversary of the Effective Time (the
"Continuation Period"), except as would be inconsistent with applicable Law, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide each individual who is employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time, who remains employed thereafter by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries (each, a
"Company Employee"), and who, in each case, is not represented by a union, labor organization, or works council with respect to
such employment, with (i) a base salary or wage rate that is no less favorable than that provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) aggregate incentive compensation opportunities and employee benefits that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those cash-based and equity-based incentive compensation opportunities and
employee benefits provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (but not taking into account any
Retention Program established pursuant to Section 6.10(d) and recognizing that equity-based compensation may be replaced with
other forms of long-term compensation). During the one-year period immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each Company Employee in a jurisdiction identified on Section 6.10(a)(1) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule who experiences a termination of employment other than for cause with the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or any of their Subsidiaries with severance benefits that are no less favorable than those set forth in the severance plan
applicable to such jurisdiction as in effect on the date hereof, as identified on Section 6.10(a)(1) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

        (b)   With respect to all employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, including
any "employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans),
each Company Employee's service with the Company or any Company Subsidiary (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of the Company or any such Company Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Subsidiaries as applicable, for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting
and benefit accruals, except (i) for purposes of any defined benefit retirement plan, any retiree welfare benefit plan, any
grandfathered or frozen plan or any plan under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive
credit for prior service or (ii) to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of
service.

        (c)   With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries in
which Company Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time and that provides medical, dental or vision
insurance benefits, for the plan year in which such Company Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to
be waived with respect to such Company Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) credit each
Company Employee for any co-payments or deductibles incurred by such Company Employee in such plan year for purposes of
any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such Post-Closing Plan and (iii) cause such
credited expenses to count toward any annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply under the
terms of the applicable plan.

        (d)   The Company may establish a cash-based retention program in the aggregate amount of $5 million to promote retention,
to incentivize efforts to consummate the Closing and to provide for a transition for a reasonable period of time following the
Closing (the "Retention Program"). Awards under the Retention Program may be allocated by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Company (or his designee(s)) among employees of the Company; provided that no awards may be granted to an individual who is
covered by a change in control agreement and any award in excess of $100,000 shall be subject to the prior approval by Parent,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each retention award under the Retention Program will vest and be paid
fifty percent (50%) immediately prior to the Effective Time, twenty-five percent (25%) on the date that is ninety (90) days after the
Effective Time and twenty-five percent (25%) on the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time subject to
continued employment through the applicable payment date; provided, however, that any unpaid portion of an award will vest in
full and be paid upon an earlier Qualifying Termination subject, in the event of a Qualifying Termination, to the employee
providing a general release of claims against the Company and its affiliates (including Company Personnel) in the form used by the
Company in the ordinary course. If a retention award under the Retention Program is forfeited by a participant prior to the
Effective Time, the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (or his designee(s)) may reallocate (subject to the parameters set forth
in this Section 6.10(d)) the retention award to existing employees or new hires of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The
Company may enter into a retention letter agreement with each recipient of a retention award under the Retention Program setting
forth the amount and terms of such award. The Company has provided to Parent a schedule reflecting its good faith expectations
regarding grants under the Retention Program, it being understood that, subject to the parameters set forth in this Section 6.10(d),
there may be additional award recipients under the Retention Program and award amounts under the Retention Program may be
higher or lower than those set forth in the schedule.

        (e)   The Company may pay to each employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries actively employed on the last
day of the Company's 2016 fiscal year (ending October 28, 2016), a full bonus under the applicable Company Benefit Plan that is
an annual bonus plan (an "Annual Bonus Plan") in respect of the Company's 2016 fiscal year based on actual performance during
such fiscal year, such payment to be made at the earlier of (x) immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y) in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice. The Company may establish awards for employees of the Company under an
Annual Bonus Plan in respect of the Company's 2017 fiscal year (ending October 27, 2017) and the related performance goals, in
each case, in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice. If the Effective Time occurs during the Company's
2017 fiscal year, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to each Company Employee who participated in an Annual Bonus Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who experiences a Qualifying Termination at or following the Effective Time and
prior to payment of such bonus (subject to the employee providing a general release of Claims against the Company and its
Affiliates, including Company Personnel, in the form used by the Company in the ordinary course) a bonus equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the Company Employee's full year bonus entitlement under all such Annual Bonus Plans for the
Company's 2017 fiscal year based on actual performance, and (ii) a fraction (not to exceed 1), the numerator of which equals the
number of days that have elapsed during such fiscal year through the date of the Qualifying Termination and the denominator of
which equals 365, with such bonus being paid at the same time as bonuses to Company Employees who remain in the employ of
the Company, but in any event not later than the 15th day of the third month following the later of (A) the end of calendar year of
the Qualifying Termination and (B) the end of the Company's fiscal year in which the Qualifying Termination occurs.

        (f)    Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Company Benefit
Plans will occur at or prior to the Effective Time, as applicable.

        (g)   Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other service provider any right to continue in
the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or
terminate the services of any Company Employee or other service provider at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without
cause. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan or
any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
maintained or sponsored by Parent, Surviving Company, of any of their Affiliates or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation
or benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.10 shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Company Employee or
current or former service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

        SECTION 6.11    Merger Sub.     

        (a)   Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not engage in any activity of any nature, except for activities related to or in
furtherance of the Merger.

        (b)   Parent hereby (i) guarantees the due, prompt and faithful payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub of, and
compliance by Merger Sub with, all of the covenants and agreements of Merger Sub under this Agreement and (ii) agrees to take
all actions necessary, proper or advisable to ensure such payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub hereunder.

        SECTION 6.12    Takeover Statutes.     If any Takeover Statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement

ensure that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each Party and their respective

would require disclosure pursuant to this Section 6.14(a) and which (i) has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in,
any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder not being true and correct as if made at and as of the date of this
Agreement or at and as of the Effective Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such
earlier date) or (ii) has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.03 to be satisfied.

        (b)   Any disclosure pursuant to this Section 6.14 shall not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, including for purposes of the termination rights contained in this
Agreement or of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in Section 7.03 have been satisfied, and Parent's and/or Merger
Sub's receipt of information pursuant to this Section 6.14 shall not operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation,
warranty or agreement given or made by the Company in this Agreement.

        (c)   Except in the case of a material and willful breach of this Section 6.14, the failure to give any notice pursuant to this

provided, however, that if, prior to the End Date, all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VII have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing; provided, that such
conditions are reasonably capable of being satisfied prior to the End Date) other than the condition set forth in
Section 7.01(b) or, if solely relating to any Legal Restraint in respect of any Antitrust Law, Section 7.01(c), then either
Parent or the Company may extend the End Date by a total of two (2) three (3) month periods by written notice to the other
Party prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the End Date (and if so extended, such later date being the End Date);
provided, further, that neither the Company nor Parent may terminate this Agreement or extend the End Date pursuant to
this Section 8.01(b)(i) if it (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) is in breach of any of its covenants or agreements in this
Agreement and such breach has caused or resulted in either (1) the failure to satisfy the conditions to the obligations of the
terminating Party to consummate the Merger set forth in Article VII prior to the End Date or (2) the failure of the Closing to
have occurred prior to the End Date;

         (ii)  the condition set forth in Section 7.01(c) is not satisfied and (A) in the case of a Legal Restraint in respect of any
Antitrust Law of the United States giving rise to such nonsatisfaction, (1) a preliminary or permanent injunction in respect
of the applicable such Antitrust Law has been entered and (2) the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement has delivered

such Company Stockholders Meeting has been adjourned, in which case at the final adjournment thereof).

        (c)    Termination by the Company.    The Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement:

          (i)  if, prior to Company Stockholder Approval and in accordance with Section 5.02, the Company enters into a

Approval is obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting; or

         (ii)  if Parent or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform any of its covenants or agreements contained herein, or if
any of the representations or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub contained herein fails to be true and correct, which breach
or failure (1) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.01, Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(b), as
applicable, and (2) is not reasonably capable of being cured by Parent or Merger Sub by the End Date (as it may be

Securities Act, within ten (10) Business Days after such tender offer or exchange offer is first published, sent or given, a
statement reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation and recommending that stockholders reject such tender or
exchange offer (provided that the issuance by the Company of any "stop, look and listen" communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act prior to such statement and recommendation shall not give Parent
the right to terminate this Agreement); provided, however, that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 8.01(d)(ii) after the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting;

        (iii)  if the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its covenants or agreements contained herein, or if any of the
representations or warranties of the Company contained herein fails to be true and correct, which breach or failure
(1) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.01, Section 7.03(a) or Section 7.03(b), as applicable,
and (2) is not reasonably capable of being cured by the Company by the End Date (as it may be extended pursuant to
Section 8.01(b)(i)) or is not cured by the Company within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice from Parent of such
breach or failure; provided, however, that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.01(d)(iii) if Parent is then in breach of any covenant or agreement contained herein or any representation or
warranty of Parent contained herein then fails to be true and correct such that the conditions set forth in Section 7.02(a) or
Section 7.02(b), as applicable, could not then be satisfied.

        The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01 (other than pursuant to Section 8.01(a)) shall give written
notice of such termination to the other Party specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is being
effected.

        SECTION 8.02    Effect of Termination; Termination Fees.     

        (a)   In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 8.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of the Company or
Parent (or any stockholder, Affiliate or Representative thereof), whether arising before or after such termination, based on, arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution, performance or subject matter hereof (whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity), except for (i) Section 4.11, the last
sentence of Section 6.02(a) , Section 6.02(b), Section 6.08, this Section 8.02 and Article IX, which provisions shall survive such
termination and (ii) subject to Section 8.02(c), liability of any Party (whether or not the terminating Party) for any fraud or willful
breach of this Agreement prior to such termination but solely to the extent such liability arises out of fraud or willful breach by
such Party of any covenant or agreement set forth herein that gave rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII, in which
event such Party shall be liable for the actual damages of the other Party. The liabilities described in the preceding sentence shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

        (b)    Termination Fees.    

          (i)  If (A) either Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) and, at the time of
such termination, any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b) or, in connection with any Legal Restraint in respect of
any Antitrust Law, Section 7.01(c), shall have not been satisfied, (B) either Parent or the Company terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) in connection with any Legal Restraint in respect of any Antitrust Law, or (C) the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(ii) based on a failure by Parent to perform its covenants or
agreements under Section 6.03 (provided, that such failure results or would be reasonably likely to result in the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 7.01(b) or, to the extent relating to any Legal Restraint in respect of any Antitrust Law,
Section 7.01(c) to be satisfied), then Parent shall pay to the Company a fee of $150,000,000 in cash (the "Parent
Termination Fee"). Parent shall pay the Parent Termination Fee to the Company (to an account designated in writing by the
Company) within two (2) Business Days after the date of the applicable termination.

         (ii)  If the Company enters into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Company Proposal and
(A) substantially concurrently therewith the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i) or
(B) thereafter Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(i), then the Company shall pay to Parent a fee
of $75,000,000 in cash (the "Company Termination Fee") at or prior to such termination (in the case of the foregoing
clause (A)) or within two Business Days after such termination (in the case of the foregoing clause (B)).

        (iii)  If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii)(A), then the Company shall pay to Parent the
Company Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days after such termination.

        (iv)  If (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) or Section 8.01(b)(iii) or
(B) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(iii) as a result of a breach of the Company's covenants or
agreements under Section 5.02 or pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii)(B) or (C), and, in each case, prior to such termination, (I) a
Company Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed and not have been withdrawn, (II) within three hundred
fifteen (315) days after the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or consummated, a Company Takeover Proposal (whether or not the same Company Takeover Proposal referred
herein) and (III) at the time of such termination, the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b) and, to the extent relating to any
Legal Restraint in respect of any Antitrust Law, Section 7.01(c), shall have been satisfied or are reasonably expected to be
satisfied prior to the End Date, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee no later than the earlier
of the execution of any definitive agreement with respect to the relevant Company Takeover Proposal and the
consummation of the relevant Company Takeover Proposal.

         (v)  For purposes of this Section 8.01(b), the term "Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to
such term in Section 5.02(g)(i), except that the applicable percentage in the definition of "Company Takeover Proposal"
shall be "50.1%" rather than "15% or more".

        (c)   The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in Section 8.02(b) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. Without
limiting any rights of either Party under Section 9.10 prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, if this
Agreement is validly terminated under circumstances in which the Company is obligated to pay the Company Termination Fee or
Parent is obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee, upon payment of the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Termination
Fee, as applicable, the Company or Parent and Merger Sub (as applicable) shall have no further liability with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to the other Parties or any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, and
payment of the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee (as applicable) shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and
shall be Parent's or the Company's (as applicable) sole and exclusive remedy for any Claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, suffered or
incurred by Parent or the Company (as applicable), each Party's Subsidiaries and any other Person in connection with this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby (and the termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and Parent and Merger Sub or the Company (as applicable) shall not have, and each expressly waives and
relinquishes, any other right, remedy or recourse (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at
common law or by statute) or in equity); provided that, regardless of whether Parent or the Company pays or is obligated to pay the
Parent Termination Fee or Termination Fee (as applicable), nothing in this Section 8.02(c) will release any Party from liability for a
willful breach of this Agreement. While a Party may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with Section 9.10
and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee or Company Termination Fee (as applicable), under no circumstances shall a Party
be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the Closing and payment of any portion of
the Parent Termination Fee or Company Termination Fee (as applicable). The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall
the Company be required to

Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

        SECTION 8.03    Amendment.     This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time before or after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval; provided, however, that (a) after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment
that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company, without the further approval of such stockholders, (b) no
amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the Effective Time and (c) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement
shall require the approval of the stockholders of Parent or the stockholders of the Company. This Agreement may not be amended, except
by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

        SECTION 8.04    Extension; Waiver.     At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) subject to Section 8.03(a), waive compliance with any
covenants and agreements contained herein or (d) waive the satisfaction of any of the conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the
part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party.
The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights.

        SECTION 8.05    Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver.     A termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01, an amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to Section 8.04 shall, in order
to be effective, require, in the case of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, action by its respective board of directors or the duly authorized
designee of its board of directors. Termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall not require the approval of the
stockholders of the Company. The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 shall give written notice of such
termination to the other Parties in accordance with Section 9.02, specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such
termination is effected.

ARTICLE IX

        SECTION 9.03    Defined Terms.     For purposes of this Agreement, each capitalized term has the meaning given to it, or specified,
in Exhibit A.

        SECTION 9.04    Interpretation.     

        (a)    Time Periods.    When calculating the period of time before which, within which or following which any act is to be
done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, (i) the date that is the reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded
and (ii) if the last day of such period is not a Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business Day.

        (b)    Dollars.    Unless otherwise specifically indicated, any reference herein to $ means U.S. dollars.

        (c)    Gender and Number.    Any reference herein to gender shall include all genders, and words imparting the singular
number only shall include the plural and vice versa.

        (d)    Articles, Sections and Headings.    When a reference is made herein to an Article or a Section, such reference shall be to
an Article or a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings contained herein are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

        (e)    Include.    Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used herein, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation."

        (f)    Hereof.    The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used
herein shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.

        (g)    Extent.    The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends,
and such phrase shall not mean simply "if."

        (h)    Contracts; Laws.    Any Contract or Law defined or referred to herein means such Contract or Law as from time to time

incorporated and made a part hereof and are an integral part of this Agreement. The Company may, at its option, include in the
Company Disclosure Schedule items that are not material in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion, or any
references to dollar amounts herein or in the Company Disclosure Schedule, shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement or
representation that such items are material, to establish any standard of materiality or to define further the meaning of such terms
for purposes of this Agreement or otherwise. Any matter set forth in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be referred to and incorporated in any section to which it is specifically referenced or cross-referenced and also in all

determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

        SECTION 9.06    Counterparts.     This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts (including by means of facsimile or
email in .pdf format), all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties.

        SECTION 9.07    Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.     This Agreement, taken together with the Company Disclosure
Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, between or among the Parties with respect to the Merger. Except for Section 6.09, each Party agrees that (i) their
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the other Parties, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement and (ii) this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any
Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth
herein.

        SECTION 9.08    Governing Law.     This Agreement, and all Claims or causes of action of the Parties (whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity) that may be based on, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution, due diligence, performance or subject matter hereof, shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflict of laws thereof or of any other jurisdiction.

        SECTION 9.09    Assignment.     Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties.
Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

        SECTION 9.10    Specific Enforcement.     The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, at any time prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, subject to the limitations in Section 8.02(c), the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this
Agreement, including the right of a Party to cause each other Party to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in any court referred to in Section 9.11 (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties
further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason,
nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. If any Party brings any Claim to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly available to such Party pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the End Date shall automatically be extended by the period
of time between the commencement of such Claim and the date on which such Claim is fully and finally resolved.

        SECTION 9.11    Jurisdiction; Venue.     

        (a)   All Claims arising from, under or in connection with this Agreement shall be raised to and exclusively determined by the
Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of
Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), to whose
jurisdiction and venue the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit. Each Party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of Claim arising out of this Agreement in such court and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such Claim brought in
any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party further agree that service of any process, summons, notice
or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in Section 9.02 hereof shall be effective service of process
for any Claim brought against such Party in any such court.

        (b)   Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to submit itself, and hereby irrevocably submits itself, to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or, if neither
of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in the
event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) irrevocably agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and
agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying of venue in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii) irrevocably agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and
any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of the
State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, and (iv) irrevocably consents to service of process being made through the
notice procedures set forth in Section 9.02.

        SECTION 9.12    Waiver of Jury Trial.     EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
(A) THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO
ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVERS AND (C) THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12.

        SECTION 9.13    Construction.     Each of the Parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the Parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

GUARANTY 

        To induce the Company to enter into this Agreement, Komatsu Ltd. (the "Guarantor"), as primary obligor and not merely as a surety,
hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees full and timely payment and performance of the duties, obligations and
responsibilities of Parent and Merger Sub specified in this Agreement or arising out of or relating to this Agreement as and when required
to be performed hereunder, including the obligation of Parent, subject to the terms and satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, to, at or prior to the Effective Time, make available or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent cash in an amount equal
to the Payment Fund and to pay any fees and expenses of Parent or Merger Sub, any damages arising from the breach by Parent or Merger
Sub of their obligations under this Agreement and any other obligations of Parent or Merger Sub (collectively, the "Guaranteed
Obligations"), and shall be deemed to have made, and shall be liable for, all of the representations and warranties, covenants and other
agreements of Parent contained herein.

        The Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that this guaranty is a primary obligation of the Guarantor, and that the Company shall be
entitled to make any demand hereunder, and pursue all of its rights and remedies, against all or any of the Guarantor, Parent and Merger
Sub, whether or not the Company has made any demand or pursued any remedies against Parent or Merger Sub. This is a guarantee of
payment and performance, and not merely of collectability. The obligations of the Guarantor under this guaranty shall be enforceable
against the Guarantor to the same extent as if the Guarantor were the primary obligor (and not merely a surety) under this Agreement.

        The Guarantor hereby waives as to itself promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this guarantee and of the Guaranteed
Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of any Guaranteed
Obligations incurred, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or
hereafter in effect, and all suretyship defenses.

        The Guarantor agrees that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or
otherwise affected by (i) the failure or delay on the part of the Company to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy
against Parent or Merger Sub; (ii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any waiver,
compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement made in accordance
with the terms thereof or any agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(iii) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of the Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person interested in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) the adequacy of any other means the Company may have of obtaining payment
related to any of the Guaranteed Obligations, (v) any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets, marshalling of assets and liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of
creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition with creditors or readjustment, or other similar proceeding or any other inability to
pay or perform affecting the Guarantor, Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (vi) the existence of any claim, set-off or other right which Guarantor may have at any time against the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether in connection with such
transactions or otherwise; (vii) the adequacy of any other means the Company may have of obtaining payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations or (viii) the value, genuineness, validity, regularity, illegality or enforceability of this Agreement or any agreement or
instrument related to this Agreement; provided, however, that the Guarantor shall be entitled to all rights, defenses and counterclaims of
Parent and/or Merger Sub with respect to any Claim for enforcement of this Guaranty.

        This Guaranty may not be revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force and effect and shall be binding on Guarantor, its
successors and assigns until all amounts payable by Guarantor under this Guaranty with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations have been
indefeasibly paid in full.

        The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that the waivers by the Guarantor set forth in this Guarantee are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. For
the avoidance of doubt, if Parent or Merger Sub is obligated to consummate the Merger pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, no further act or thing need occur to establish the Guarantor's liability hereunder, and no act or thing, except full performance
of the Guaranteed Obligations, shall in any way exonerate or discharge the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder or modify, limit or
release the Guarantor's liability hereunder. The Company may, at any time, take any and all actions available hereunder or under applicable
law to enforce Guarantor's obligations hereunder, regardless of whether action is brought against Parent or Merger Sub or whether Parent
or Merger Sub is joined in any such action or actions.

        All payments by the Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty shall be made in lawful money of the United States in immediately available
funds. Guarantor promises and undertakes to make all payments hereunder free and clear of any deduction, offset, defense, claim or
counterclaim of any kind. In the event that any payment hereunder is rescinded or must otherwise be returned for any reason whatsoever,
Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder as if such payment had not been made.

        The Guarantor may not assign or delegate its rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any other person (by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the Company.

        The terms of Sections 9.02, 9.07 and 9.11 of this Agreement shall apply to this Guaranty mutatis mutandis.

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL 

July 21, 2016
Board of Directors
Joy Global, Inc.
100 East Wisconsin Ave., Ste. 2780
Milwaukee, WI 53202

Gentlemen:

        You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Komatsu Ltd. ("the Parent")
and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $1 per share (the "Shares"), of Joy Global, Inc. (the "Company") of
the $28.30 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 21, 2016 (the
"Agreement"), by and among Parent, the Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

        Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading,
research, investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman,
Sachs & Co. and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic
interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities,
derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Parent, any of their
respective affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the
Agreement (the "Transaction"). We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and have participated in certain of
the negotiations leading to, the Transaction. We expect to receive fees for our services in connection with the Transaction, a significant
portion of which is contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses
arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement. We have provided certain financial advisory
and/or underwriting services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time for which our Investment Banking division has
received, and may receive, compensation. We also have provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Parent and/or
its affiliates from time to time. We may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Parent
and their respective affiliates for which our Investment Banking Division may receive compensation.

        In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to stockholders and Annual
Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five fiscal years ended October 30, 2015; certain interim reports to stockholders and
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; certain other communications from the Company and Parent to their respective
stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company and Parent; and certain internal financial analyses and
forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for our use by the Company (the "Forecasts"). We have also held
discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current business
operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares;
compared certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the
securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the mining and industrial
equipment manufacturing industries and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other
factors, as we deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of
the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any
responsibility for independent verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been
reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We
have not made an independent evaluation, appraisal or geological or technical assessment of the assets and liabilities (including any
contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we have not been
furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Transaction
in any way meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the
Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our
analysis.

        Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative merits of
the Transaction as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory,
tax or accounting matters. We were not requested to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of,
or other business combination with, the Company or any other alternative transaction. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a
financial point of view to the holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the $28.30 in cash per Share to
be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or
aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or
entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including, the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration received in
connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the
fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company,
or class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the $28.30 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders
(other than Parent and its affiliates) pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the impact of the
Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company or Parent or the ability of the Company or Parent to pay their respective
obligations when they come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and
the information made available to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this
opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion expressed
herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the
Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote with respect to such
Transaction or any other matter. This opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman, Sachs & Co.

        Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the $28.30 in cash per Share to be paid to the
holders (other than Parent and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

Very truly yours,

/s/ GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.

Annex C 

SECTION 262 OF THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE 

§ 262 Appraisal rights [Effective Aug. 1, 2016] [For application of this section, see 79 Del. Laws, c. 72, § 22, 79 Del. Laws, c. 122, § 12
and 80 Del. Laws, c. 265, § 18]

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or
consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of
the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in
this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include
what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository
representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the
depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)
(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

        (1)   Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall
be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date
fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or
consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further
provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the
merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title.

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger
or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything
except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository
receipts in respect thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or
depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be
either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a.
and b. of this section; or

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional
depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or
§ 267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of
the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title,
appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set
forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the
words "merger or consolidation," and the word "corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or "surviving
or resulting corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in
which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of
incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance
with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this
section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice
a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each
stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the
vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if
it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A
stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the
effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each
constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or
consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within
10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to
appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the
constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or
consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the
case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by
§ 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice
did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such

constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the
holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the
merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or
within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the
sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the
consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second
notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder's
shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the
corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie
evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent
corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided,
that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If
no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day
next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder
who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an
appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such
stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw
such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this
section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the
consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to
which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be
mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or
resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this
section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such
stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition or request from
the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a
duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom
agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by
the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the
surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given
by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of
Wilmington, Delaware or such

publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the
costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have
become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold
stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the
appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such
stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to
which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders
of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for
such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance
with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the
Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the
merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair
value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,
and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall
be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time
to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of
judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case
interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair
value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion,
proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose
name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted
such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is
finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated
stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates
representing such stock. The Court's decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such
surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in
connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to
be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided
in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other
distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective
date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in
subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such
stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the
right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery
shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the
Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal
proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered
upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this
section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been
converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or
resulting corporation.
