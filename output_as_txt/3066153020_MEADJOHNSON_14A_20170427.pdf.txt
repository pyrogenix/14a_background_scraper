MEAD JOHNSON NUTRITION COMPANY
April 27, 2017

Dear Fellow Stockholder:

        We are pleased to invite you to attend our special meeting of stockholders (the "special meeting") to be held on May 31, 2017, at 1:00 p.m. Central
Daylight Time at the offices of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, 300 North LaSalle, Chicago, Illinois 60654.

        On February 10, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as may be amended from time to time, the "merger agreement") with
Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, a company incorporated in England and Wales ("Reckitt Benckiser") and Marigold Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser ("Merger Sub"), pursuant to which Reckitt Benckiser will indirectly acquire the Company by
means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity following the merger as a wholly
owned indirect subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser (the "merger"). At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon:

(1) a proposal to adopt the merger agreement; 

(2) a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at
the time of the special meeting to establish a quorum or adopt the merger agreement (the "Adjournment Proposal"); and 

(3) a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the payment of certain compensation and benefits to our named executive officers,
which they will or may be entitled to receive from the Company (or its successor) and as a consequence of the merger (the "Merger-Related
Compensation Proposal").

        If the merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $90.00 in cash, without interest and less any required tax withholding, for each share of our
common stock you own, unless you have properly exercised your appraisal rights with respect to such shares.

        After due consideration and discussion, our Board has unanimously (i) determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared advisable the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (iii) recommended adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders. Our
Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (2) "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal
and (3) "FOR" the non-binding, advisory Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.

        The enclosed proxy statement provides detailed information about the special meeting, the merger agreement and the merger. A copy of the merger
agreement is attached as Annex A to the accompanying proxy statement. The proxy statement also describes the actions and determinations of our Board in
connection with its evaluation of the merger agreement and the merger. We encourage you to read the proxy statement and its annexes, including the
merger agreement, carefully and in their entirety. You may also obtain more information about the Company from documents we file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") from time to time.

        YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. The merger cannot be completed unless the merger agreement is adopted by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock. EVEN IF YOU PLAN TO ATTEND THE SPECIAL MEETING IN
PERSON, WE

REQUEST THAT YOU AUTHORIZE YOUR PROXY TO VOTE YOUR SHARES BY EITHER MARKING, SIGNING, DATING AND
PROMPTLY RETURNING THE PROXY CARD OR SUBMITTING YOUR PROXY OR VOTING INSTRUCTIONS BY TELEPHONE OR
INTERNET. If you attend the special meeting and desire to vote in person, you may do so even though you have previously sent a proxy. The
failure to vote will have exactly the same effect as voting against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        If your shares are held in "street name," you should instruct your broker on how to vote your shares, following the procedures provided by
your broker. Your broker will be unable to vote your shares without instructions from you. The failure to instruct your broker on how to vote
your shares will have exactly the same effect as voting against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

information contained in this document or the accompanying proxy statement. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

proxy, will have exactly the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        If you attend the special meeting in person and fail to vote in person by ballot, that will be treated as an abstention. Abstentions will have the same
effect as voting "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. However, abstentions will have no effect on the result of the vote on the
Adjournment Proposal or the non-binding, advisory Merger-Related Compensation Proposal, although abstentions will be considered present for the
purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

        If your shares are held in "street name," you should instruct your broker on how to vote your shares, following the procedures provided by your
broker. Your broker will be unable to vote your shares without instructions from you. The failure to instruct your broker on how to vote your shares will

225 North Canal Street, 25th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60606, stating that you would like to revoke your proxy, (ii) completing and submitting a new proxy

bank or other agent, you must follow instructions received from such broker, bank or agent with this proxy statement in order to revoke your vote or to
vote in person at the special meeting.

        Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 13, 2017, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting or at any
postponement or adjournment thereof. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available in our offices located at 225 North

        Stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement will have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of the shares of
our common stock they own, if they deliver a demand for appraisal before the vote is taken on the adoption of the merger agreement and comply with all
the requirements of Delaware law, which are summarized herein and reproduced in their entirety in Annex D to this proxy statement.

• The Special Meeting (Page 25)

Time and Place of the Special Meeting (Page 25)

        The special meeting will be held on May 31, 2017, at 1:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time, at the offices of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, 300 North LaSalle,
Chicago, Illinois 60654. We intend to hold the special meeting on the same date as the general meeting of the stockholders of Reckitt Benckiser (the
"Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting").

Purpose of the Special Meeting (Page 25)

        The purpose of the special meeting is for our stockholders to consider and vote upon (1) a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (2) a proposal to
adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special
meeting to establish a quorum or adopt the merger agreement (the "Adjournment Proposal"); and (3) a proposal, on a non-binding, advisory basis, to
approve the payment of certain compensation to our named executive officers, which they will or may be entitled to receive from the Company (or its
successor) and which is based on or otherwise relates to the merger (the "Merger-Related Compensation Proposal", as described in the section entitled
"The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Potential Change in Control Payments to Named Executive Officers"
beginning on page 73).

Record Date, Notice and Quorum (Page 25)

        You are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting if you owned shares of our outstanding common stock at the close of business on
April 13, 2017, the record date for the special meeting. As of the record date, there were 183,635,708 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled
to be voted at the special meeting.

        A quorum is required for stockholders to conduct business at the special meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of our common stock is necessary to establish a quorum at the meeting. Abstentions are counted as present for the purpose of
determining whether a quorum is present, while broker non-votes are not counted as present unless instructions have been provided by the beneficial
owner to the applicable broker, bank or other agent with respect to at least one proposal. Each of "FOR", "AGAINST" and "ABSTAIN" categories will be
tabulated separately. In the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that the meeting will be postponed or adjourned to solicit
additional proxies, and the persons named as proxies may propose and vote for one or more postponements or adjournments of the special meeting;
however, no proxy voted against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will be voted in favor of the Adjournment Proposal.

Who Can Vote at the Special Meeting (Page 26)

        If on the record date, your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Shareowner Services, then you are a
stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record,

Table of Contents

you may vote in person at the meeting or vote by proxy. If on that date, your shares were held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, dealer or similar
organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by that organization.
The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the special meeting. As a beneficial owner of
shares held in street name, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent on how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend
the special meeting. However, if your shares are held in street name, you are not the stockholder of record, and you may not vote your shares in person at
the meeting unless you request and obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker or other agent.

Vote Required (Page 26)

        The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the close of business on the record date is
required to adopt the merger agreement. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock present at the
special meeting, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote at the special meeting is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal and the non-
binding, advisory Merger-Related Compensation Proposal. You will have one vote for each share of common stock you owned at the close of business on
the record date.

How You Can Vote (Page 26)

        You can vote shares you hold of record by voting in person at the special meeting, by mailing the enclosed proxy card, or by voting over the telephone
or over the Internet. If your shares are held in "street name," you should instruct your broker on how to vote your shares, following the procedures
provided by your broker. Your broker will be unable to vote your shares without instructions from you. The failure to instruct your broker on how to vote
your shares will have exactly the same effect as voting against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

How You May Revoke or Change Your Vote (Page 27)

        You can change your vote in one of three ways at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting, by (i) giving written notice to our
Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at 225 North Canal Street, 25th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60606, stating that you would like to revoke
your proxy, (ii) completing and submitting a new proxy card bearing a later date (in any of the permitted forms), or (iii) attending the special meeting and
voting in person. Simply attending the meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other agent,
you must follow instructions received from such broker, bank or agent with this proxy statement in order to revoke your vote or to vote in person at the
special meeting.

Proxy Solicitation (Page 27)

        We will pay for the cost of soliciting proxies and may reimburse brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding solicitation material to
beneficial owners. Solicitation will be made primarily through the use of the mail but our officers, directors and employees may, without additional
compensation, solicit proxies personally by telephone, facsimile, mail or the Internet or in person. We have retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated
("Innisfree") to assist us in soliciting proxies using the means referred to above. We will pay the fees of Innisfree, which we expect to be approximately
$25,000, plus reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses.

Adjournments of the Special Meeting (Page 28)

        We are asking our stockholders to consider and vote upon a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to establish a quorum or adopt the merger agreement, which we refer to
as the Adjournment Proposal.

        You should note that the chairman of the meeting may postpone or adjourn the special meeting to a specified date including, among other reasons, to
solicit additional proxies or to hold the special meeting on the same date and at the same time as the Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting.

        If the special meeting is postponed or adjourned for any reason, including to solicit additional proxies or to hold the special meeting on the same date
and at the same time as the Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting, stockholders who have already sent in their proxies will be able to revoke them at any
time prior to their use. No proxy voted against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will be voted in favor of the Adjournment Proposal. For more
information, see the section entitled "Adjournment Proposal" on page 101.

• The Merger (Page 29)

        We are asking our stockholders to consider and vote upon the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, pursuant to which Reckitt Benckiser will
indirectly acquire the Company by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity
following the merger as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser. Our Board is providing this proxy statement and the accompanying form
of proxy to holders of our common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies for use at the special meeting.

        The full text of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. We urge you to read the merger agreement carefully and in
its entirety. If our stockholders adopt the merger agreement and the merger is completed as contemplated by the merger agreement, you will be entitled to
receive $90.00 in cash, without interest and less any required tax withholding, for each share of our common stock you own, unless you have properly
exercised your appraisal rights with respect to such shares, and:

• you will no longer have any interest in our future earnings or growth; 

• we will no longer be a public company; 

• our common stock will no longer be traded on the New York Stock Exchange; and 

• we may no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC. 

• Merger Consideration (Page 29)

        At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding (i) share of our common stock (other than (x) shares held by the Company as treasury stock
(other than shares held for the account of clients, customers or other persons), (y) held by Reckitt Benckiser or by any subsidiary of either the Company or
Reckitt Benckiser and (z) held by a stockholder who perfects appraisal rights in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law) will
automatically be converted into the right to receive $90.00 in cash, without interest and less any required tax withholding, and (ii) vested and unvested
stock option, unvested performance stock unit ("PSU") and unvested restricted stock unit ("RSU") granted prior to execution of the merger agreement will
be cancelled and the holders will be entitled to receive the merger consideration of $90.00 per share in cash, less the applicable exercise price in the case of
stock options, and less any required tax withholding. Each outstanding unvested RSU granted after execution of the merger agreement will be converted
into a Converted Reckitt Benckiser RSU, which is a phantom restricted stock unit based on Reckitt Benckiser common stock and settled in cash. No such

shares of our common stock outstanding prior to the effective time of the merger will remain outstanding after such effective time of the merger and all
such shares will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist at the effective time of the merger. The price of $90.00 per share in cash was determined
through arm's-length negotiations between us and Reckitt Benckiser.

• Treatment of Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards (Page 29)

        Stock Options.    At the effective time of the merger, each stock option that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock
for which such stock option has not been exercised and (ii) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration of $90.00 per share over the exercise price per
share of such stock option. Each stock option with an exercise price equal to or greater than the merger consideration will be cancelled immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger without payment of any consideration.

        Restricted Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each RSU that was outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement (see "2017 Equity
Awards" below for treatment of RSUs granted after the date of the merger agreement) and remains outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger will vest and be cancelled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject
to such RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and (ii) the merger consideration of $90.00 per share.

        Performance Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each PSU that remains outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will vest and be cancelled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to
such PSU (the "PSU Amount") and (ii) the merger consideration of $90.00 per share. The PSU Amount equals the sum of (x) the number of shares of
common stock underlying such award based on actual performance for any completed one-year performance period ending prior to the effective time of
the merger, and (y) the number of shares of common stock underlying such award based on target performance for any one-year performance period that
has not been completed as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

        2017 Equity Awards.    The Company may grant equity awards after the date of the merger agreement, but prior to the effective time of the merger, in
connection with its annual practice of granting equity awards and as otherwise permitted by the merger agreement, and such awards shall consist solely of
RSUs. Each RSU that is granted after the date of the merger agreement and that remains outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
will, as of the effective time of the merger, convert into a phantom RSU award tied to shares of Reckitt Benckiser's common stock (with the cash value of
each RSU for conversion purposes equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such award and (ii) the merger
consideration of $90.00 per share) that will be settled in cash upon satisfaction of the applicable vesting conditions (such converted awards, the "Converted
Reckitt Benckiser RSUs"). Each Converted Reckitt Benckiser RSU will remain subject to the same terms and conditions as the RSU to which it relates
(including vesting).

• Reasons for the Merger (Page 39) and Recommendation of Our Board (Page 43)

        Our Board considered a number of factors in making its determination that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. Among others, the Board considered that that the merger consideration
will be paid in cash providing certainty, immediate value and liquidity to our stockholders and that a price of $90.00 per share in cash represents a
premium of approximately 29% to the closing price of our common stock on February 1, 2017, the last trading day before the Company and Reckitt
Benckiser publicly confirmed they were in discussions for the acquisition of the Company by Reckitt

Benckiser at a price of $90.00 per share. Our Board also identified and considered a number of countervailing factors and risks to the Company and our
stockholders relating to the merger and the merger agreement, including, among others, the possibility that the merger may not be completed and the
potential adverse consequences to the Company as a result and the fact that, if the merger is completed, our stockholders will not participate in any future
earnings or growth of the Company as an independent company and will not benefit from any future appreciation in the value of the Company. See the
section entitled "The Merger—Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 39 for detailed description of our Board's reasons for the merger.

        After due consideration and discussion of the factors described above, our Board unanimously (i) determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and
declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (iii) recommended adoption of the merger
agreement by our stockholders.

        Our Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (2) "FOR" the Adjournment
Proposal and (3) "FOR" the non-binding, advisory Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.

• Opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co. (Page 49)

        In connection with the merger, at the special meeting of our Board on February 9, 2017, Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("Goldman Sachs") rendered its oral
opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 10, 2017, to our Board that, as of such date and based upon
and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $90.00 per share in cash to be paid to the holders (other than Reckitt Benckiser and its
affiliates) of the outstanding shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

        The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated February 10, 2017, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of our Board in
connection with its consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of our common stock
should vote with respect to the merger or any other matter. Pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs, the
Company has agreed to pay Goldman Sachs a transaction fee of approximately $40 million, all of which is contingent upon completion of the
merger, and reimburse certain fees and expenses in accordance with the terms of the engagement letter.

• Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (Page 57)

        In connection with the merger, at the special meeting of our Board on February 9, 2017, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ("Morgan Stanley") rendered its
oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, to our Board that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set
forth therein, the $90.00 per share in cash merger consideration to be received by the holders (other than the Company, Reckitt Benckiser or their
respective affiliates) of the outstanding shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such
holders.

        The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley delivered to our Board, dated February 9, 2017, is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex C and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement. The opinion sets forth, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures
followed,

Table of Contents

matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion. Our
stockholders are urged to, and should, read the opinion carefully and in its entirety. Morgan Stanley's opinion is directed to our Board and
addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, to our stockholders of the $90.00 per share in cash merger consideration to be received
by such holders pursuant to the merger agreement as of the date of the opinion. Morgan Stanley's opinion does not address any other aspect of
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and does not constitute a recommendation to our stockholders as to how to vote at the
special meeting held in connection with the merger. The summary of Morgan Stanley's opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the full text of Morgan Stanley's opinion. Pursuant to an engagement letter between the Company and Morgan Stanley,
the Company has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a transaction fee of approximately $24 million, all of which is payable upon completion of the
merger, and reimburse certain fees and expenses regardless of the completion of the merger.

• Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (Page 66)

        In considering the recommendation of our Board that you vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, you should be aware that certain of
our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of the Company and our
stockholders generally. These interests may create a potential conflict of interest and may be perceived to have affected their decision to support or adopt
the merger agreement. Our Board was aware of these potential conflicts of interest during its deliberations on the merits of the merger and in making its
decision to adopt the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. These interests include, but are not limited to,
accelerated vesting of outstanding equity-based awards granted prior to execution of the merger agreement, conversion of outstanding equity-based awards
granted following execution of the merger agreement into Converted Reckitt Benckiser RSUs, the receipt of severance and other separation benefits in the
event of certain terminations of employment on or following the consummation of the merger, entitlement to receive a tax gross-up payment to make any
affected executive whole, on an after-tax basis, for any taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")
and continuation of indemnification rights and coverage under our directors' and officers' liability insurance policies. Our stockholders should be aware of
these interests when considering our Board's recommendation to adopt the merger agreement.

• Employee Matters (Page 94)

        Under the merger agreement, Reckitt Benckiser and Merger Sub are required to provide continuing employees of the Company, through
December 31, 2018, with (i) compensation, annual bonus opportunity and severance benefits that are no less favorable than the continuing employees'
current compensation, bonus opportunity and severance benefits, and (ii) other employee benefits that are, generally, no less favorable in the aggregate to
the continuing employees' current benefits provided by the Company. In addition, Reckitt Benckiser and Merger Sub are generally required to recognize
each such continuing employee of the Company's service with the Company for purposes of any new benefit plan implemented after the merger and take
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such continuing employees of the Company' coverage and benefits under any new health and welfare plans
implemented for the continuing employees are not adversely effected by the transition to the new health and welfare plans. The merger agreement provides
that the Company and Reckitt Benckiser acknowledge that the effect of the merger shall be a "change in control" or "change of control" of the Company
for purposes of any applicable Company employee benefit plan.

• No Solicitation of an Acquisition Proposal (Page 88)

        We have agreed in the merger agreement, between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time, to certain limitations on our ability to take
action with respect to alternative acquisition transactions. Notwithstanding these limitations, the merger agreement provides that, at any time prior to
obtaining the requisite Company stockholder vote for the adoption of the merger agreement, we may consider and discuss with a third party an acquisition
proposal if our Board determines in good faith, after considering advice from a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel, (i) that such acquisition proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal and (ii) that a failure to take such
action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with our directors' fiduciary duties under the Delaware General Corporation Law (as amended, the
"DGCL"), subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in the merger agreement and as further detailed in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement
—No Solicitation of an Acquisition Proposal; Company Adverse Recommendation Change" beginning on page 88.

        Our Board may (i) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Reckitt Benckiser, or publicly propose to fail to make, withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Reckitt Benckiser, a recommendation by our Board to our stockholders to adopt the merger agreement (the "Company
Board Recommendation"), (ii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in this proxy statement or (iii) recommend, adopt or approve or
publicly propose to recommend, adopt or approve the merger agreement (the "Company Adverse Recommendation Change"), whether in connection with
a superior proposal, or otherwise, if our Board determines in good faith, after considering advice from a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Delaware law. However, unless and until the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the merger agreement and the merger will be
submitted to our stockholders at the special meeting notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Additional limitations and
conditions to the Company Adverse Recommendation Change are described in detail in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of an
Acquisition Proposal; Company Adverse Recommendation Change" beginning on page 88.

• Conditions to the Merger (Page 95)

        The respective obligations of the Company, Reckitt Benckiser and Merger Sub to effect the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain
customary conditions, including the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders, the approval of the merger by Reckitt Benckiser's stockholders,
expiration (or earlier termination) of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"),
which was satisfied on March 24, 2017, when the waiting period was terminated, the receipt of certain other non-U.S. regulatory approvals, a majority of
which such approvals have been granted as of the date hereof, the absence of any legal prohibitions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the parties, compliance by the parties with their respective obligations under the merger agreement and the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect
(as defined in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger" beginning on page 95).

• Reckitt Benckiser Stockholder Approval (Page 79)

        In order to complete the merger, Reckitt Benckiser must obtain the affirmative vote of a majority of Reckitt Benckiser's stockholders present, in
person or by proxy, at the Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting approving the merger. The Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting is scheduled to be held
on May 31, 2017, subject to adjournment or postponement in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Under certain circumstances, Reckitt Benckiser may be required to pay the
Company a reverse termination fee of $480,000,000 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. More information can be found in the

proceeds of which, among other uses, will be used by Reckitt Benckiser to fund (i) all or a portion of the merger consideration, (ii) the refinancing of
existing indebtedness of the Company and its affiliates and (iii) the fees, costs and expenses in connection with the merger. The merger agreement
provides,

however, that obtaining such debt financing is not a condition to Reckitt Benckiser's or Merger Sub's obligations to close the merger.

• Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (Page 77)

        In general, your receipt of the merger consideration will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes if you are a U.S. Holder (as
defined in the section entitled "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 77). If you are a U.S. Holder, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received pursuant
to the merger and your adjusted basis in the shares surrendered. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled "The Merger—Material
U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 77), you will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange
of our common stock for cash in the merger unless you have certain connections with the United States. The tax consequences of the merger to you will
depend upon your own particular circumstances. You should consult your tax advisor in order to fully understand the tax consequences of the merger to
you.

• Legal Proceedings (Page 80)

        The Company, all of the members of our Board and, in some cases, Reckitt Benckiser and Merger Sub, were named as defendants in multiple putative
class action lawsuits brought by stockholders of the Company challenging the merger, including one complaint brought in the Circuit Court of Cook
County, Illinois and four complaints brought in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. In the complaint brought in the Circuit Court
of Cook County, Illinois, the plaintiff asserts claims that the members of the Board breached their fiduciary duties to the Company stockholders in
connection with the merger, and that the Company, Reckitt Benckiser and Merger Sub aided and abetted such breaches of fiduciary duties. In the
complaints brought in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, the plaintiffs challenge the proxy statement, bringing claims under
Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Among other things, these complaints generally seek
either to enjoin the proposed merger or to rescind the merger in the event it is consummated. The Company and its directors intend to defend vigorously
against the allegations in all five complaints.

• Anticipated Closing of the Merger (Page 81)

        We intend to complete the closing of the merger promptly after all of the conditions to consummation of the merger are satisfied or waived, including
the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders. We currently expect the merger to be completed in the third calendar quarter of 2017, although
we cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all. We will issue a press release and letters of transmittal for your use once the merger has been
completed.

• Appraisal Rights (Page 103)

        If the merger is consummated, our stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who properly demand appraisal
of their shares of our common stock will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL, which is attached to
this proxy statement as Annex D.

• Market Price (Page 108)

        Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "MJN." On February 1, 2017, the last full trading day before the
Company's and Reckitt Benckiser's public confirmation of advanced negotiations of the merger, our common stock closed at $69.50 per share.

MEAD JOHNSON NUTRITION COMPANY
PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE

SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER 

Q: Why am I receiving these materials? 

A: On February 10, 2017, the Company entered into the merger agreement with Reckitt Benckiser and Merger Sub. You are receiving this proxy
statement as a stockholder of the Company in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement and the other matters to be voted on at the special meeting described below under "—What am I voting on at the special meeting?" The
merger cannot be completed unless the merger agreement is adopted by stockholders holding at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our
common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. 

Q: What am I voting on at the special meeting? 

A: At the special meeting, you are voting on the following three proposals: 

• a proposal to adopt the merger agreement; 

• a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes at the time of the special meeting to establish a quorum or adopt the merger agreement (the "Adjournment Proposal"); and 

• a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the payment of certain compensation and benefits to our named executive
officers, which they will or may be entitled to receive from the Company (or its successor) and as a consequence of the merger (the
"Merger-Related Compensation Proposal", as described in the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of the Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger—Potential Change in Control Payments to Named Executive Officers" beginning on page 73). 

Q: How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote? 

A: Our Board unanimously recommends that you vote (i) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (ii) "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal
and (iii) "FOR" the non-binding, advisory Merger-Related Compensation Proposal. 

Q: What is the proposed merger and what effects will it have on the Company? 

A: If approved by our stockholders, pursuant to the merger agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company
continuing as the surviving entity following the merger as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser.

At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding (i) share of our common stock (other than (x) shares held by the Company as treasury stock
(other than shares held for the account of clients, customers or other persons), (y) held by Reckitt Benckiser or by any subsidiary of either the
Company or Reckitt Benckiser and (z) held by a stockholder who perfects appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware law) will automatically be
converted into the right to receive $90.00 in cash, without interest and less any required tax withholding, and (ii) vested and unvested stock option
and unvested RSU and PSU granted prior to execution of the merger agreement will be cancelled and the holders will be entitled to receive the
merger consideration of $90.00 per share in cash, less the applicable exercise price in the case of stock options, and less any required tax
withholding. Each outstanding unvested RSU granted after execution of the merger agreement will be converted into a Converted Reckitt
Benckiser RSU, which is a phantom restricted stock unit

based on Reckitt Benckiser common stock and settled in cash. At the effective time of the merger, no such shares of our common stock outstanding
prior to the merger will remain outstanding after the merger and all such shares will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist. The price of
$90.00 per share in cash was determined through arm's-length negotiations between us and Reckitt Benckiser.

For additional information about the merger, please review the merger agreement attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement. We encourage you to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, as it is the principal document
governing the merger.

Q: What will I receive in the merger? 

A: Upon completion of the merger, you will receive $90.00 in cash, without interest and less any required tax withholding, for each share of our
common stock you own (excluding common stock subject to forfeiture restrictions), unless you have properly exercised your appraisal rights with
respect to such shares. For example, if you own 1,000 shares of our common stock, you will receive $90,000.00 in cash in exchange for your
shares of common stock, less any required tax withholding. You will not own any shares in the surviving corporation. 

Q: Is the merger a taxable transaction to stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes? 

A: The exchange of shares of our common stock for cash pursuant to the merger generally will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax
purposes if you are a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section entitled "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences"). If you are a
U.S. Holder, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will generally recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the
amount of cash received pursuant to the merger and your adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered. If you are a Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in
the section entitled "The Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences"), you will generally not be subject to U.S. federal income tax
with respect to the exchange of our common stock for cash in the merger unless you have certain connections with the United States. Under certain
circumstances, we may be required to withhold a portion of your merger consideration under applicable tax laws. See the section entitled "The
Merger—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" beginning on page 77 for a more detailed discussion of the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the merger. Note that this proxy statement does not discuss the tax consequences to stockholders of selling shares of our common
stock prior to the completion of the merger. The tax consequences of the merger to you will depend on your own particular circumstances. You
should consult your tax advisor in order to fully understand the tax consequences of the merger to you. 

Q: Will the Company continue to pay distributions prior to the effective time of the merger? 

A: As permitted by the merger agreement and subject to the approval of our Board, we currently expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly dividend
of $0.4125 per share of our common stock per quarter, with record and payment dates consistent with the quarterly record and payment dates in
2016, until the last business day before the closing of the merger. On March 1, 2017, our Board declared a dividend of $0.4125 per share, which
was paid on April 3, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 13, 2017. 

Q: Where and when is the special meeting? 

A: The special meeting will be held on May 31, 2017, at 1:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time, at the offices of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, 300 North LaSalle,
Chicago, Illinois 60654.

Q: Do Reckitt Benckiser's stockholders have to approve the merger? 

A: Yes. In order to complete the merger, Reckitt Benckiser must obtain the affirmative vote of a majority of Reckitt Benckiser's stockholders present,
in person or by proxy, at the Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting approving the merger. The Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting is scheduled
to be held on May 31, 2017, subject to adjournment or postponement in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. 

Q: Who is entitled to vote and how do I vote? 

A: All stockholders of record at the close of business on April 13, 2017, the record date for the special meeting, will be entitled to notice of and to
vote at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, 183,635,708 shares of our common stock were outstanding. Each share
is entitled to one vote on each proposal presented at the special meeting.

Carefully read this document and indicate on the proxy card how you want to vote. Sign, date and mail your proxy card in the enclosed return
envelope as soon as possible. You may also vote electronically on the Internet or by telephone as instructed in the materials. To ensure that your
vote is recorded promptly, please vote as soon as possible, even if you plan to attend the special meeting in person. Submitting your vote now will
not prevent you from later canceling or revoking your proxy, right up to the day of the special meeting, and will ensure that your shares are voted if
you later find you cannot attend the special meeting. IF YOU DO NOT VOTE, THIS WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS VOTING
"AGAINST" THE PROPOSAL TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

Q: What if I submit a proxy and later change my mind? 

A: If you have given your proxy and later wish to revoke it, you may do so at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting, by (i) giving
written notice to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at 225 North Canal Street, 25th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60606, stating
that you would like to revoke your proxy, (ii) completing and submitting a new proxy card bearing a later date (in any of the permitted forms), or
(iii) attending the special meeting and voting in person. Simply attending the meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy. If your shares are held
in the name of a broker, bank or other agent, you must follow instructions received from such broker, bank or agent with this proxy statement in
order to revoke your vote or to vote in person at the special meeting. 

Q: What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in street name? 

A: Stockholder of Record. If, on the record date, your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Shareowner
Services, then you are a stockholder of record, and we sent the proxy materials directly to you. As a stockholder of record, you may vote in person
at the meeting or vote by proxy.

Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If, on the record date, your shares were held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, dealer or
similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and these proxy materials were forwarded to you by that
organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the special meeting. As a
beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent on how to vote the shares in your account. You are also invited to attend
the special meeting. However, if your shares are held in street name, you are not the stockholder of record and you may not vote your shares in
person at the meeting unless you request and obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker or other agent.

Q: If I hold shares through the Mead Johnson Nutrition Company Retirement Savings Plan, how do I vote? 

A: For voting purposes, the proxy card includes all shares credited to your account under the Mead Johnson Nutrition Company Retirement Savings
Plan held in custody by the plan trustee. In order to direct the plan trustee to vote the shares held in your account, you must vote the shares by
10:59 p.m. Central Daylight Time on May 25, 2017. If your voting instructions are not received by that time, the trustee will vote the shares
credited to your account in the same proportion as the plan shares for which voting instructions have been received, unless contrary to the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Please follow the instructions set forth above for voting of stockholders of record to cast your
vote. Although you may attend the special meeting, you may not vote shares held in your Mead Johnson Nutrition Company Retirement Savings
Plan account at the special meeting. 

Q: Will my shares held in "street name" or another form of ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares I hold of record? 

A: No. Because any shares you may hold in "street name" will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than any shares you hold of record, any
shares so held will not be combined for voting purposes with shares you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms,
such as jointly with your spouse, as trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy
card for those shares because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation or business entity must be voted
by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an IRA must be voted under the rules governing the account. If you receive more than one
proxy card because you are a holder of record and your shares of our common stock are registered in more than one name, please submit each
proxy and voting instruction card that you receive. 

Q: I share an address with another stockholder, and we received only one paper copy of the proxy materials. How may I obtain an additional
copy of the proxy materials? 

A: We have adopted a procedure approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission called "householding." Under this procedure, stockholders of
record who have the same address and last name and do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials will receive only one copy of the
proxy statement. This procedure is intended to reduce our printing costs and postage fees.

If you or another stockholder of record with whom you share an address wish to receive a separate proxy statement, we will promptly deliver it to
you if you request it by calling Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., toll-free in the United States at (866) 540-7095 or by writing to Broadridge
Financial Solutions, Inc., Attention: Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717. If you or another stockholder of
record with whom you share an address are receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement, you can request to receive a single copy of these
materials in the future by contacting Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. in the same manner as described above.

Q: What constitutes a quorum for the meeting? 

A: A quorum is required for stockholders to conduct business at the special meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of our common stock is necessary to establish a quorum at the meeting. On the record date, there were 183,635,708
shares of our common stock outstanding. Shares present, in person or by proxy, including shares as to which authority to vote on any proposal is
withheld, shares abstaining as to any proposal, and broker non-votes (where a broker submits a properly executed proxy but does not have
authority

Table of Contents

to vote a customer's shares on non-routine matters such as the proposal to adopt the merger agreement) on any proposal will be considered present
at the meeting and entitled to vote for purposes of establishing a quorum for the transaction of business at the meeting. Each of these categories
will be tabulated separately. In the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that the meeting will be postponed or
adjourned to solicit additional proxies, and the persons named as proxies may propose and vote for one or more postponements or adjournments of
the special meeting; however, no proxy voted against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will be voted in favor of the Adjournment
Proposal.

Q: How are votes counted? 

A: Each of "FOR", "AGAINST" and "ABSTAIN" categories will be tabulated separately. If you are a stockholder of record and vote your shares by
submitting a proxy, your shares will be voted at the special meeting as you indicated on your proxy card. If no instructions are indicated on your
signed proxy card, all of your shares of common stock will be voted "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, "FOR" the
Adjournment Proposal and "FOR" the non-binding, advisory Merger-Related Compensation Proposal. However, if your shares are held in street
name, and you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other agent on how to vote your shares, your shares will not be voted. It will have the same
effect as voting "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, but will not have any effect on the Adjournment Proposal or the non-
binding, advisory Merger-Related Compensation Proposal. 

Q: Who will count the vote? 

A: Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will tabulate votes and act as the Inspector of Election at the special meeting. 

Q: What is a proxy? 

A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote your shares of our common stock. The written document describing the matters to be
considered and voted on at the special meeting is referred to as this proxy statement. The document used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of
our common stock is referred to as a proxy card. 

Q: What does it mean to vote by proxy? 

A: It means that you give someone else the right to vote your shares in accordance with your instructions. In voting by proxy, you ensure that you vote
will be counted even if you are unable to attend the special meeting. 

Q: My shares are held in the "street name." Will my broker vote my shares? 

A: Your broker will be unable to vote your shares without instructions from you. If your shares are held in street name, you should have received a
vote instruction form with these proxy materials from your broker, bank or other agent rather than from the Company. Simply complete and return
the vote instruction form to your broker, bank or other agent to ensure your vote is counted. Alternatively, you may vote by telephone or over the
Internet as instructed by your broker, bank or other agent. To vote in person at the special meeting, you must obtain a valid legal proxy from your
broker, bank or other agent. Follow the instructions from your broker or agent included with these proxy materials, or contact your broker, bank or
agent to request a legal proxy form.

The failure to instruct your broker on how to vote your shares will have exactly the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement.

Table of Contents

Q: How are "ABSTAIN" votes counted? 

A: If you are a stockholder of record and abstain from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if you voted "AGAINST" the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement. If your shares are held in street name, and you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other agent on how to vote your
shares, your shares will not be voted, which will also have the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.
Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast in favor of or against the Adjournment Proposal or the non-binding, advisory
Merger-Related Compensation Proposal, but will count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. 

Q: What vote is required to adopt the merger agreement, the Adjournment Proposal and the non-binding, advisory Merger-Related
Compensation Proposal? 

A. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the close of business on the record date is
required to adopt the merger agreement. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 183,635,708 shares of our common stock
outstanding. This means that under Delaware law, 91,817,855 shares or more must vote in the affirmative to adopt the merger agreement.

The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock present at the special meeting, either in person or
by proxy, and entitled to vote at the special meeting, is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal and the non-binding, advisory Merger-
Related Compensation Proposal.

Q: What happens if I do not vote on the proposal to adopt the merger agreement? 

A: BECAUSE THE VOTE REQUIRED TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS BASED ON THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE
OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AS OF THE RECORD DATE, AND NOT JUST THE SHARES THAT ARE
ENTITLED TO VOTE OR ACTUALLY VOTED AT THE SPECIAL MEETING, IF YOU DO NOT VOTE (INCLUDING IF YOU
HOLD YOUR SHARES THROUGH A BROKER, BANK OR OTHER AGENT AND DO NOT RETURN YOUR VOTE
INSTRUCTIONS TO THE BROKER, BANK OR OTHER AGENT), IT WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS VOTING "AGAINST"
THE PROPOSAL TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT. If the merger is completed, whether or not you vote for the proposal to adopt
the merger agreement, you will receive the merger consideration for your shares of our common stock upon completion of the merger, unless you
properly exercise your appraisal rights. See the section entitled "Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 103 and Annex D to this proxy statement. 

Q: What happens if the merger is not completed? 

A: If the merger is not completed for any reason, you will not receive any payment for your shares of our common stock. We will remain an
independent public company and our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, so long as we continue
to meet the applicable listing requirements.

Under certain circumstances, upon termination of the merger agreement, we may be obligated to pay to Reckitt Benckiser a termination fee of
$480,000,000 and/or expense reimbursement of up to $20,000,000 of Reckitt Benckiser's expenses incurred in connection with the merger
agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. Under certain circumstances, Reckitt Benckiser may be required to pay us a
reverse termination fee of $480,000,000 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. More information can be found in the
section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees" beginning on page 99.

Table of Contents

Q: Will stockholders have appraisal rights? 

A: Yes. Under the laws of the State of Delaware, which is our state of incorporation, any stockholder who does not vote in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement and remains a holder of our common stock at the effective time of the merger may, by complying with the procedures set forth
in Section 262 of the DGCL and sending us a written demand for appraisal before the vote is taken on the adoption of the merger agreement, be
entitled to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares. Appraisal rights are contingent upon completion of the merger. See the section entitled
"Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 103 and Annex D to this proxy statement. 

Q: Why am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, the non-binding, advisory Merger-Related Compensation Proposal? 

A: Under the SEC rules, we are required to seek a non-binding, advisory vote with respect to the compensation and benefits that will or may become
payable to our named executive officers as a consequence of the merger. 

Q: What will happen if the Company's stockholders do not approve the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal? 

A: Approval of the merger-related compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive officers as a consequence of the merger is
not a condition to completion of the merger. The vote is an advisory vote and will not be binding on the Company or the surviving corporation in
the merger. Because the merger-related compensation to be paid to the named executive officers as a consequence of the merger is based on
contractual arrangements with the named executive officers, such compensation may be payable, regardless of the outcome of this advisory vote, if
the merger agreement is adopted and the merger is completed (subject only to the contractual obligations applicable thereto). 

Q: Do any of the Company's directors or executive officers have interests in the merger that may differ from or be in addition to my interests
as a stockholder? 

A: Our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally, as set
forth below. Our Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and in recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by our stockholders. These
interests include (i) the accelerated vesting and payment of our outstanding stock options, RSUs, and PSUs, in each case, granted prior to execution
of the merger agreement, (ii) the grant of 2017 equity-based awards, which will convert into Reckitt Benckiser equity-based awards upon the
closing of the merger, (iii) certain severance and other separation benefits that may be payable upon certain terminations of employment following
the effective time of the merger, (iv) entitlement to receive a tax gross-up payment to make any affected executive whole, on an after-tax basis, for
any taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, as amended, and (v) entitlement to continued indemnification and insurance coverage under the
merger agreement. 

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed? 

A: We intend to complete the closing of the merger promptly after all of the conditions to completion of the merger are satisfied or waived, including
the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders. We currently expect the merger to be completed in the third calendar quarter of 2017,
although we cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all. We will issue a press release and letters of transmittal for your use once the
merger has been completed. See the section

Q: When can I expect to receive the merger consideration for my shares? 

A: Once the merger is completed, you will receive in a separate mailing a letter of transmittal and other documents to be delivered to the exchange
agent in order to receive the merger consideration. Once you have submitted your properly completed letter of transmittal, stock certificates and
other required documents to the exchange agent, the exchange agent will send you a check for the merger consideration.

If you hold book-entry shares, you do not need to deliver a properly completed letter of transmittal or stock certificates to the exchange agent, since
stock certificates are not issued for such shares. Instead, following receipt of an "agent's message" from the exchange agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the exchange agent may reasonably request), you will be entitled to receive from the exchange agent the merger
consideration payable in respect of such book-entry shares.

Q: What happens if I sell my shares of common stock before the special meeting? 

A: The record date for stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting is earlier than the expected date of the merger. If you transfer your shares of
our common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain your right to vote at
the special meeting but will transfer the right to receive the merger consideration to the person to whom you transfer your shares. 

Q: Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies? 

A: We will pay for the cost of soliciting proxies and may reimburse brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding solicitation material to
beneficial owners. Solicitation will be made primarily through the use of the mail but our officers, directors and employees may, without additional
compensation, solicit proxies personally by telephone, facsimile, mail or the Internet or in person. We have retained Innisfree to assist us in
soliciting proxies using the means referred to above. We will pay the fees of Innisfree, which we expect to be approximately $25,000, plus
reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses. 

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the special meeting? 

A: We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the special meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed
with the SEC following the special meeting. All reports that we file with the SEC are publicly available when filed on the SEC's website at
www.sec.gov. 

Q: Where can I find out more information about the special meeting? 

A: You can find out information about the special meeting from the sources described in the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information"
on page 114. 

Q: Whom should I contact with questions? 

A: If you need additional copies of this proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, or if you have other questions about the proposals or how to vote
your shares, you may contact our proxy solicitor, Innisfree by telephone (toll free) at (888) 750-5834.

        This proxy statement contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the

"may," "project," "guidance," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion
of future operating or financial performance. You can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or
current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks, uncertainties, and assumptions including
factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are
likely to relate to, among other things, our goals, plans and projections regarding our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position,
product development, product approvals, sales efforts, expenses, capital expenditures, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the
outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and
uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years. Although we believe we have
been prudent in our plans and assumptions, we can give no assurance that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and we
caution readers not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to release publicly any
revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Actual results may differ materially from those
projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties. Certain risks associated with our business are discussed from time to time in the reports we file with
the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. In addition to
the other factors and matters contained or incorporated in this proxy statement, we believe the following factors could cause actual results to differ
materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements:

• the possibility that the merger will not be consummated or delays in consummating the merger; 

• The possibility that the closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement will not be satisfied, including among others, (i) receipt of the
required stockholder approvals, (ii) the absence of any change, circumstance, condition, state of facts, events or effect that constitutes a
material adverse effect (as further described in the merger agreement), or (iii) receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals required to
permit the merger; 

• the amount of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the merger, including the risk that the merger agreement may be terminated in
certain circumstances that would require us to pay Reckitt Benckiser a termination fee of $480,000,000 and/or expense reimbursement of
up to $20,000,000 of Reckitt Benckiser's expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by
the merger agreement the payment of which could cause significant liquidity and long-term financial viability issues for the Company; 

• adverse effects on the market price of our common stock and on our operating results because of a failure to complete the merger; 

• negative effects relating to the announcement of the merger or any further announcements relating to the merger or the entrance into or
consummation of the merger on the market price of our common stock; 

• unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the merger; 

• legal proceedings instituted against the Company and others in connection with the merger;

THE SPECIAL MEETING 

Time and Place of the Special Meeting 

        This proxy statement is being furnished to our stockholders as part of the solicitation of proxies by our Board for use at a special meeting of
stockholders to be held on May 31, 2017, at 1:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time, at the offices of Kirkland & Ellis LLP, 300 North LaSalle, Chicago,
Illinois 60654. We intend to hold the special meeting on the same date as the general meeting of the stockholders of Reckitt Benckiser.

Purpose of the Special Meeting 

        The purpose of the special meeting is for our stockholders to consider and vote upon:

• a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, pursuant to which Reckitt Benckiser will indirectly acquire the Company by means of a merger
of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity following the merger as a wholly owned
indirect subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser; 

• a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at
the time of the special meeting to establish a quorum or adopt the merger agreement (the "Adjournment Proposal"); and 

• a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the payment of certain compensation and benefits to our named executive officers,
which they will or may be entitled to receive from the Company (or its successor) and as a consequence of the merger (the "Merger-Related
Compensation Proposal", as described in the section entitled "The Merger—Interests of the Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
—Potential Change in Control Payments to Named Executive Officers" beginning on page 73).

        A copy of the merger agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. Our Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) "FOR"
the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (2) "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal and (3) "FOR" the non-binding, advisory Merger-Related
Compensation Proposal.

Record Date, Notice and Quorum 

        You are entitled to notice of and to vote at the special meeting if you owned shares of our outstanding common stock at the close of business on
April 13, 2017, the record date for the special meeting. As of the record date, there were 183,635,708 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled
to be voted at the special meeting.

        A quorum is required for stockholders to conduct business at the special meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of our common stock is necessary to establish a quorum at the meeting. Abstentions are counted as present for the purpose of
determining whether a quorum is present, while broker non-votes are not counted as present unless instructions have been provided by the beneficial
owner to the applicable broker, bank or other agent with respect to at least one proposal. Each of "FOR", "AGAINST" and "ABSTAIN" categories will be
tabulated separately. In the event that a quorum is not present at the special meeting, we expect that the meeting will be postponed or adjourned to solicit
additional proxies, and the persons named as proxies may propose and vote for one or more postponements or adjournments of the special meeting;
however, no proxy voted against the adoption of the merger agreement will be voted in favor of the Adjournment Proposal.

Who Can Vote at the Special Meeting 

        If on the record date, your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Shareowner Services, then you are a
stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the meeting or vote by proxy. If on that date, your shares were held in an
account at a brokerage firm, bank, dealer or similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and these proxy
materials are being forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of
voting at the special meeting. As a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent on how to vote the
shares in your account. You are also invited to attend the special meeting. However, if your shares are held in street name, you are not the stockholder of
record, and you may not vote your shares in person at the meeting unless you request and obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker or other agent.

Vote Required 

        The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the close of business on the record date is
required to adopt the merger agreement. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 183,635,708 shares of our common stock outstanding.
This means that under Delaware law, 91,817,855 shares or more must vote in the affirmative to adopt the merger agreement. The affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock present at the special meeting, either in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote at the
special meeting, is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal and the non-binding, advisory Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.

        BECAUSE THE VOTE REQUIRED TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT IS BASED ON THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THE
OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AS OF THE RECORD DATE, AND NOT JUST THE SHARES THAT ARE
ENTITLED TO VOTE OR ACTUALLY VOTED AT THE SPECIAL MEETING, IF YOU DO NOT VOTE (INCLUDING IF YOU HOLD
YOUR SHARES THROUGH A BROKER, BANK OR OTHER AGENT), IT WILL HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME EFFECT AS VOTING
"AGAINST" THE PROPOSAL TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

        If you are a stockholder of record and abstain from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if you voted "AGAINST" the proposal to
adopt the merger agreement. If your shares are held in street name, and you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other agent on how to vote your shares,
your shares will not be voted, which will also have the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement. Abstentions and
broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast in favor of or against the Adjournment Proposal or the non-binding, advisory Merger-Related
Compensation Proposal, but will count for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.

        Any stockholder who does not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and remains a holder of our common stock at the effective time
of the merger may, by complying with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and sending us a written demand
for appraisal, be entitled to seek appraisal of the fair value of their shares. Appraisal rights are contingent upon completion of the merger. See the section
entitled "Appraisal Rights" beginning on page 103 and Annex D to this proxy statement.

How You Can Vote 

        If your shares are held in record name, you may sign, date and mail your proxy card in the enclosed return envelope. IF YOU DO NOT VOTE,
THIS WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS VOTING "AGAINST" THE PROPOSAL TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

Table of Contents

        If your shares are held in street name, you should have received a vote instruction form with these proxy materials from your broker, bank or other
agent rather than from the Company. Simply complete and return the vote instruction form to your broker, bank or other agent to ensure that your vote is
counted. You may also vote electronically on the Internet or by telephone as instructed by your broker or other agent. YOUR BROKER, BANK OR
OTHER AGENT WILL BE UNABLE TO VOTE YOUR SHARES WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONS FROM YOU. THE FAILURE TO INSTRUCT
YOUR BROKER ON HOW TO VOTE YOUR SHARES WILL HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME EFFECT AS VOTING "AGAINST" THE
PROPOSAL TO ADOPT THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

        Your shares will be voted at the special meeting as you indicated on your proxy card. If no instructions are indicated on your signed proxy card, all of
your shares of our common stock will be voted "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal and "FOR" the
non-binding, advisory Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.

        You should indicate your vote now even if you expect to attend the special meeting and vote in person. Indicating your vote now will not prevent you
from later canceling or revoking your proxy, right up to the day of the special meeting, and will ensure that your shares are voted if you later find you
cannot attend the special meeting. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other agent and you wish to vote in person at the special
meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from your broker, bank or other agent. Follow the instructions from your broker, bank or agent included with these
proxy materials, or contact your broker, bank or agent to request a proxy form.

Stock Ownership and Interests of Certain Persons 

        As of April 13, 2017, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 1,109,082 shares of our
common stock, representing approximately 0.60% of the shares of our common stock outstanding on April 13, 2017. Our directors and executive officers
have informed us that they currently intend to vote (1) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (2) "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal and
(3) "FOR" the non-binding, advisory Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.

        Certain members of our management and Board have interests that are different from or in addition to those of stockholders generally. See the section
entitled "The Merger—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 66.

How You May Revoke or Change Your Vote 

        You can change your vote in one of three ways at any time before your proxy is voted at the special meeting, by (i) giving written notice to our
Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at 225 North Canal Street, 25th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60606, stating that you would like to revoke
your proxy, (ii) completing and submitting a new proxy card bearing a later date (in any of the permitted forms), or (iii) attending the special meeting and
voting in person. Simply attending the meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other agent,
you must follow instructions received from such broker, bank or agent with this proxy statement in order to revoke your vote or to vote in person at the
special meeting.

Proxy Solicitation 

        We will pay for the cost of soliciting proxies and may reimburse brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding solicitation material to
beneficial owners. Solicitation will be made primarily through the use of the mail but our officers, directors and employees may, without additional
compensation, solicit proxies personally by telephone, facsimile, mail or the Internet or in person. We have retained Innisfree to assist us in soliciting
proxies using the means referred to above. We will pay

the fees of Innisfree, which we expect to be approximately $25,000, plus reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses.

Adjournments of the Special Meeting 

        We are asking our stockholders to consider and vote upon a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to establish a quorum or adopt the merger agreement, which we refer to
as the Adjournment Proposal.

        You should note that the chairman of the meeting may postpone or adjourn the special meeting to a specified date including, among other reasons, to
solicit additional proxies or to hold the special meeting on the same date and at the same time as the Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting.

        If the special meeting is postponed or adjourned for any reason, including to solicit additional proxies or to hold the special meeting on the same date
and at the same time as the Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting, stockholders who have already sent in their proxies will be able to revoke them at any
time prior to their use. No proxy voted against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will be voted in favor of the Adjournment Proposal. In the event
of a postponement or adjournment of the special meeting, we will provide at least ten days' notice of the new date, time and place of the special meeting,
as required by our bylaws. See the section entitled "Adjournment Proposal" on page 101.

PROPOSAL NO. 1 

ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

THE MERGER 

        We are asking our stockholders to consider and vote upon a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, pursuant to which Reckitt Benckiser will
indirectly acquire the Company by means of a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity
following the merger as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser. Our Board is providing this proxy statement and the accompanying form
of proxy to holders of our common stock in connection with the solicitation of proxies for use at the special meeting.

        The full text of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. We urge you to read the merger agreement carefully and in
its entirety. If our stockholders adopt the merger agreement and the merger is completed as contemplated by the merger agreement, you will be entitled to
receive $90.00 in cash, without interest and less any required tax withholding, for each share of our common stock you own (excluding common stock
subject to forfeiture restrictions), unless you have properly exercised your appraisal rights with respect to such shares, and:

• you will no longer have any interest in our future earnings or growth; 

• we will no longer be a public company; 

• our common stock will no longer be traded on the New York Stock Exchange; and 

• we may no longer be required to file periodic and other reports with the SEC.

Merger Consideration 

        At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding (i) share of our common stock (other than (x) shares held by the Company as treasury stock
(other than shares held for the account of clients, customers or other persons), (y) held by Reckitt Benckiser or by any subsidiary of either the Company or
Reckitt Benckiser and (z) held by a stockholder who perfects appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware law) will automatically be converted into the
right to receive $90.00 in cash, without interest and less any required tax withholding, and (ii) vested and unvested stock option and unvested RSU and
PSU granted prior to execution of the merger agreement will vest (to the extent unvested) and be cancelled and the holders will be entitled to receive the
merger consideration of $90.00 per share in cash, less the applicable exercise price in the case of stock options, and less any required tax withholding.
Each outstanding unvested RSU and PSU granted after execution of the merger agreement will be converted (with such conversion determined based on
achievement of target performance for the PSUs) into a Converted Reckitt Benckiser RSU, which is a phantom restricted stock unit based on Reckitt
Benckiser common stock, subject to the same terms and conditions (exclusive of any performance-based vesting conditions) and settled in cash. No shares
of our common stock outstanding prior to the effective time of the merger will remain outstanding after the effective time of the merger and all such shares
will automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist at the effective time of the merger. The price of $90.00 per share in cash was determined through
arm's-length negotiations between us and Reckitt Benckiser. See "The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration" beginning on page 82 for more detailed
information.

Treatment of Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards 

        Stock Options.    At the effective time of the merger, each stock option that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock
for which such stock option has not been exercised and (ii) the excess, if any, of the merger

consideration of $90.00 per share over the exercise price per share of such stock option. Each stock option with an exercise price equal to or greater than
the merger consideration will be cancelled immediately prior to the effective time of the merger without payment of any consideration.

        Restricted Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each RSU that was outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement (see "2017 Equity
Awards" below for treatment of RSUs granted after the date of the merger agreement) and remains outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger will vest and be cancelled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject
to such RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and (ii) the merger consideration of $90.00 per share.

        Performance Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each PSU that remains outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will vest and be cancelled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the PSU Amount and (ii) the merger consideration
of $90.00 per share. The PSU Amount equals the sum of (x) the number of shares of common stock underlying such award based on actual performance
for any completed one-year performance period ending prior to the effective time of the merger, and (y) the number of shares of common stock underlying
such award based on target performance for any one-year performance period that has not been completed as of immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger.

        2017 Equity Awards.    The Company may grant equity awards after the date of the merger agreement, but prior to the effective time of the merger, in
connection with its annual practice of granting equity awards and as otherwise permitted by the merger agreement, and such awards shall consist solely of
RSUs. Each RSU that is granted after the date of the merger agreement and that remains outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
will, as of the effective time of the merger, convert into a Converted Reckitt Benckiser RSU, which is a phantom RSU based on Reckitt Benckiser
common stock and settled in cash (with the cash value of each RSU for conversion purposes equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common
stock subject to such award and (ii) the merger consideration of $90.00 per share). Each Converted Reckitt Benckiser RSU will remain subject to the same
terms and conditions as the PSU or RSU to which it relates (including vesting).

Background of the Merger 

        Our Board, together with our management, periodically reviews and assesses the Company's business plan and potential strategic opportunities
available to the Company with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. As part of this ongoing process, our Board and management have periodically
evaluated whether the continued execution of the Company's strategy as a standalone company or the sale of the Company to, or a combination of the
Company with, a third party offers the best avenue to maximize stockholder value.

        Beginning in December 2015 and continuing through fall 2016, we engaged in discussions with a company which we refer to as Company A
regarding various potential transactions, including potential joint ventures between the two companies or a potential merger with Company A. These
discussions included multiple meetings between the management teams of each party. At none of these meetings was a specific proposal or offer made for
the acquisition of the Company. Although the parties explored various potential transactions, they were unable to agree upon any transaction structure or
terms that were both feasible and sufficiently attractive to each party and, by the fall of 2016, although the parties remained intermittently in contact, no
further meetings or other substantive discussions took place.

        On June 9 and 10, 2016, our Board conducted its annual review of the Company's strategic plan, during which our Board considered three potential
strategic paths for the Company: (1) continuing as a stand-alone business, (2) acquiring or partnering with another business or (3) undertaking a change of
control transaction. At the meeting, our Board and management noted that the Company's growth was

being negatively impacted by a lack of distribution and marketing scale relative to its competitors, and discussed the potential merits of finding a partner
with greater scale or pursuing increased scale through a change of control transaction. Our Board also reviewed and approved financial projections
covering the period from 2017-2021 (the "June 2016 Projections"). Goldman Sachs was present at the meeting to assist our Board in its consideration of
strategic alternatives.

        Throughout 2016 Goldman Sachs continued to provide financial advisory services to us in connection with various potential strategic alternatives.
The Company selected Goldman Sachs, and later engaged it specifically in respect of a potential transaction with Reckitt Benckiser, because of its
qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of our business and affairs, and because Goldman Sachs was experienced and knowledgeable about our
industry, strategic positioning, future prospects, and potential strategic partners.

        Consistent with the June 2016 Board discussion, later in June 2016, Mr. Kasper Jakobsen, our Chief Executive Officer, requested and subsequently
held a meeting with the Chief Executive Officer of a company which we refer to as Company B regarding a potential transaction between the parties that
would involve a change of control of the Company. The discussion was general in nature and no specific proposals or offers were made. During that
meeting, the Chief Executive Officer of Company B informed Mr. Jakobsen that for various reasons Company B was not interested in pursuing a potential
transaction at such time.

        On September 30, 2016, we entered into an engagement letter with Morgan Stanley to serve as a co-advisor to us in connection with its evaluation of
potential strategic alternatives. The Company selected Morgan Stanley because of its qualifications, expertise, reputation and knowledge of our business
and affairs, and because Morgan Stanley was experienced and knowledgeable about our industry, strategic positioning, future prospects, and potential
strategic partners.

        On December 2, 2016, Mr. James M. Cornelius, the Chairman of our Board and Mr. Robert S. Singer, a member of our Board, had a meeting with
Mr. Rakesh Kapoor, the Chief Executive Officer of Reckitt Benckiser, and Mr. Peter Harf, senior partner of JAB Holdings B.V. ("JAB"), Reckitt
Benckiser's largest stockholder. Mr. Singer and Mr. Harf knew each other as Mr. Singer serves on the boards of certain entities controlled by JAB and
Mr. Harf was familiar with Reckitt Benckiser having served as a member of its board of directors from 1999 until 2015, and Mr. Singer and Mr. Harf
helped facilitate the introductory meeting. At such meeting, the parties discussed the Company's business generally, and Mr. Kapoor mentioned that
Reckitt Benckiser had previously analyzed the Company and the Company's business sector and could be interested in exploring a potential transaction
with the Company, noting that it fit with Reckitt Benckiser's strategic interest in expanding in the area of consumer health. Mr. Kapoor noted that, while
Reckitt Benckiser could be interested in pursuing a private discussion with the Company regarding a potential transaction, it was Reckitt Benckiser's view
that if the Company was to run an auction process it would significantly increase the risk that there would be a leak potentially leading to public
speculation relating to Reckitt Benckiser's involvement in such a process and that, as a U.K. listed company, Reckitt Benckiser would be required to
confirm or deny its involvement in the process in response to such a leak. Mr. Kapoor further conveyed that, given the fact that any acquisition of the
Company would constitute the entry into a new business line for Reckitt Benckiser and that Reckitt Benckiser might still be in the process of evaluating
such an initiative, depending on when in the process the leak occurred, Reckitt Benckiser would be likely to cease discussions with the Company regarding
a potential deal in the event of a leak. Mr. Kapoor stated that, as a result of the foregoing, Reckitt Benckiser believed that if the Company were to run an
auction process it would make it less likely that a deal would be ultimately consummated even if otherwise desired by the parties.

        On December 13, 2016, at an executive session of our Board, Mr. Cornelius and Mr. Singer reported to the other Board members on the meeting that
had taken place on December 2 with Reckitt

Benckiser, and our Board indicated its support for a follow-up meeting with Reckitt Benckiser that was subsequently scheduled for December 20.

        On December 15, 2016, our Board held a telephonic meeting, during which the upcoming meeting with Reckitt Benckiser and related matters were
discussed. As part of this meeting, representatives from Kirkland & Ellis LLP, our outside counsel ("Kirkland"), led a discussion related to a potential
transaction with Reckitt Benckiser or another party, including timing and process considerations and a review of our Board's fiduciary duties under
Delaware law in connection with its consideration of a potential transaction with Reckitt Benckiser or another party. At the meeting, Mr. Cornelius
observed that, consistent with the directors' discussion at the June 9 and 10 Board meetings, Reckitt Benckiser had the distribution and marketing scale that
would benefit the Company's business, and as such may be willing to offer compelling value to Company stockholders for the enhanced growth prospects
of the Company's business on Reckitt Benckiser's platform. As part of the discussion, our Board authorized management to enter into a confidentiality
agreement with Reckitt Benckiser in advance of the upcoming meeting. Our Board also discussed timing and process for formally engaging an investment
banking firm.

        On December 19, 2016, Reckitt Benckiser and the Company signed a customary confidentiality agreement, which included a standstill prohibiting
Reckitt Benckiser from purchasing shares of, or taking certain other actions with respect to, the Company for eighteen months following the date of the
agreement without the prior consent of the Company.

        On December 20, 2016, Mr. Cornelius, Mr. Jakobsen and Mr. Michel Cup, our Chief Financial Officer, met with Mr. Kapoor, Mr. Adrian Hennah,
Reckitt Benckiser's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Brian Robertson, Reckitt Benckiser's SVP of Corporate Development and Mr. Laurent Faracci, Reckitt
Benckiser's SVP of Global Marketing. At this meeting, Mr. Jakobsen and Mr. Cup made a presentation to Reckitt Benckiser regarding the Company's
overall business, strategy and organization. The Company also conveyed to Reckitt Benckiser that the Company would not be willing to provide detailed
information regarding the Company's outlook or long-range plan or other detailed diligence access absent a written indication of interest from Reckitt
Benckiser at a price that our Board determined was sufficiently attractive to merit further discussions and diligence. Reckitt Benckiser indicated that it
would evaluate the information the Company had provided and revert with its feedback.

        At Reckitt Benckiser's request, and as part of Reckitt Benckiser's evaluation of the information it had received at the December 20 meeting, on
December 30, 2016, a follow-up meeting was held between Mr. Cup, Mr. Hennah and Mr. James Tilley, a member of Reckitt Benckiser's finance team, in
Amsterdam to discuss the Company's 2016 and other historical financial results. This was followed by a meeting via video conference, also at Reckitt
Benckiser's request, between senior members of the companies' management teams, including Mr. Jakobsen and Mr. Kapoor, that took place on January 9,
2017 to address questions from Reckitt Benckiser regarding the operation and management of the Company's business. Consistent with what the Company
had previously conveyed to Reckitt Benckiser, our executive officers did not provide detailed information regarding the Company's outlook, long-range
plan or other detailed diligence information at these meetings.

        At the request of Mr. Kapoor, Mr. Cornelius and Mr. Kapoor had a breakfast meeting on January 13, 2017 in New York, during which Mr. Kapoor
presented Mr. Cornelius with a letter outlining a non-binding proposal from Reckitt Benckiser pursuant to which Reckitt Benckiser would acquire the
Company for $90.00 per share in cash. The letter noted that Reckitt Benckiser was unwilling to engage in a traditional back and forth negotiation with
respect to value and that the proposal fully reflected Reckitt Benckiser's view of the potential synergies and long-term value of a Company combination
with Reckitt Benckiser. Mr. Kapoor emphasized that, for the reasons he had communicated to Mr. Cornelius in their meeting on December 2, 2016, Reckitt
Benckiser was not willing to participate in a broad sales process. Mr. Kapoor also emphasized that the proposal was

subject to further due diligence, including a review of the Company's long-range plan. Mr. Cornelius informed Mr. Kapoor that he and the rest of our
Board would consider Reckitt Benckiser's proposal and revert in due course. On January 13, 2017, the Company's share price closed at $70.39 per share.

        Also on January 13, 2017, we contacted Goldman Sachs to request that Goldman Sachs provide advice to us in connection with Reckitt Benckiser's
proposal.

        On January 18, 2017, our Board held a telephonic meeting to discuss Reckitt Benckiser's non-binding proposal as well as various other matters
related to a potential transaction with Reckitt Benckiser or another party. Members of our senior management team, as well as representatives of Goldman
Sachs and Kirkland, also attended the meeting. At the meeting, Mr. Cornelius and Mr. Jakobsen provided a summary of recent events, including the
meeting that Mr. Cornelius, Mr. Jakobsen and Mr. Cup had with members of Reckitt Benckiser's management team in London, as well as the subsequent
meetings in Amsterdam and via videoconference. Representatives from Goldman Sachs then reviewed certain financial aspects of Reckitt Benckiser's
proposal based on a preliminary update to the June 2016 Projections that our management was still in the process of updating. Our Board noted that the
analysis provided by Goldman Sachs was based on a preliminary update to the June 2016 Projections and discussed process and timing for the finalization
of the updated projections. Representatives from Kirkland then provided our Board with an overview of certain legal considerations regarding the
Company's evaluation of a potential transaction with Reckitt Benckiser or another party. As part of this meeting, our Board discussed potential next steps
in response to Reckitt Benckiser's proposal. After discussion, which was informed by the review of Reckitt Benckiser's proposal by Goldman Sachs, our
Board determined the offer from Reckitt Benckiser was sufficiently attractive to warrant continuing to engage in preliminary discussions with Reckitt
Benckiser, and directed management to invite representatives of Reckitt Benckiser to Chicago the following week once the Company's long-range plan had
been finalized and approved so that our management team could educate Reckitt Benckiser on the Company's business plan and growth initiatives in an
effort to seek to persuade Reckitt Benckiser to increase its offer price. At the meeting, our Board also authorized the creation of an ad hoc committee of
our Board (the "Ad Hoc Committee") solely for the purposes of efficiency to assist the full Board in its consideration of any potential transaction. Our
Board appointed Mr. Peter Ratcliffe, Dr. Steven Altschuler, Dr. Elliott Sigal, Mr. Cornelius and Mr. Michael Grobstein, such directors constituting the
chairmen of each committee of our Board, as well as Mr. Jakobsen to the Ad Hoc Committee. The members of our Board agreed that the Ad Hoc
Committee would regularly report back to our Board, and that our Board would retain all decision making power related to a potential transaction with
Reckitt Benckiser or another party.

        Also on January 18, 2017, a press article was published electronically containing unsubstantiated reports that a third party had expressed an interest in
acquiring the Company, which reports were subsequently carried by other publications including The Chicago Tribune and Bloomberg. Consistent with its
long-standing policy, the Company declined to comment on such rumors and speculation.

        On January 20, 2017, management sent our Board a proposed final update to the June 2016 Projections (the "Long-Range Plan") and a proposed final
2017 budget.

        On January 21, 2017, we entered into an engagement letter with Goldman Sachs in connection with a potential transaction involving Reckitt
Benckiser or another party as part of an existing framework advisory agreement.

        On January 22, 2017, our Board held a telephonic meeting to review the Long-Range Plan, which our Board understood that its financial advisors
would use as the basis for their financial analysis of any potential transaction, as well as to discuss developments with respect to the Company's evaluation
of a potential transaction with Reckitt Benckiser. Members of our senior management team, as well as representatives of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland,
attended the meeting, other than for the portion of the meeting in which the Long-Range Plan was discussed, for which the representatives of Goldman

Sachs and Kirkland were not present, and with respect to an executive session at the end of the meeting, for which neither Goldman Sachs, Kirkland nor
members of the management team were present. Mr. Jakobsen and Mr. Cup presented the proposed Long-Range Plan to our Board, outlining key
assumptions set forth in the plan and comparing the current plan's projected growth rates and trends with those set forth in the June 2016 Projections.
Mr. Jakobsen and Mr. Cup also discussed how the projections included in the Long-Range Plan varied from the preliminary update to the June 2016
Projections that had been provided to Goldman Sachs for purposes of its financial analysis presented to our Board on January 18. Specifically,
Mr. Jakobsen discussed that the final Long-Range Plan included projections for 2021 (which the preliminary version had not), a $0.15 per share positive
impact in 2017 due to a potential one time tax benefit and an earnings per share figure in 2020 that was slightly lower as a result of higher other operating
expenses. In addition, our Board approved the proposed final 2017 budget. Following discussion and approval of the Long-Range Plan, our Board,
together with representatives from Goldman Sachs and Kirkland, engaged in a discussion regarding how to approach the upcoming meeting with Reckitt
Benckiser, including how to present the cost and revenue synergies available to Reckitt Benckiser as well as the Company's financial performance and
outlook, particularly in light of the Company's recent challenges and the fact that headwinds including the impact on net sales of a strengthening U.S.
dollar, slowing growth in certain markets and increased costs with respect to advertising and promotion spend remained in the business especially in 2017.
As part of such discussion, our Board communicated to management that the primary objective of the upcoming meeting was to seek to educate Reckitt
Benckiser on the Company's business plan and growth initiatives in an attempt to persuade Reckitt Benckiser to increase its offer price. Our Board also
asked Kirkland about our Board's fiduciary duties under Delaware law in connection with a potential transaction, and received an overview of such
obligations and considerations from Kirkland. Mr. Jakobsen also informed our Board of a phone call he had received from the Chief Executive Officer of
Company A prompted by unsubstantiated press reports that the Company was in discussions regarding a potential sale of the Company. Mr. Jakobsen
explained that, consistent with the Company's policy on such matters, he had declined to comment on the rumor on the call. Mr. Jakobsen noted that the
Chief Executive Officer of Company A indicated that they were considering whether to make an offer to acquire the Company, but did not request any
further information from the Company during the call or request to engage in discussions regarding a potential transaction with the Company.

        On January 24 and January 25, 2017, a two-day management presentation and due diligence session was conducted between the Reckitt Benckiser
and Company executive teams in Chicago, with Mr. Cornelius also attending the meetings. The meetings covered a broad range of topics relating to the
Company's business, including the Long-Range Plan, other financial and strategic matters and an overview of the Company's operations and key
commercial markets.

        On January 26, 2017, we announced our financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016, during which net sales were 7% below
the comparable quarter in the prior year on a reported basis, and announced that it expected 2017 GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.05 to $3.20 per
share, below the consensus of Wall Street research analysts' estimates. On January 26, 2017, our share price closed at $73.04 per share.

        On January 27, 2017, Mr. Cornelius called Mr. Kapoor in an attempt to persuade him to raise Reckitt Benckiser's offer on the basis of the further
information received and diligence conducted by Reckitt Benckiser in Chicago. Mr. Kapoor informed Mr. Cornelius that he would reply later that day or
the following day. Later that same day, Mr. Kapoor informed Mr. Cornelius that, while Reckitt Benckiser remained interested in pursuing a transaction at
$90.00 per share, nothing Reckitt Benckiser had learned through the two day management presentation and diligence session in Chicago had changed its
position on the transaction price and therefore Reckitt Benckiser was unwilling to raise its initial offer. However, Mr. Kapoor explained that, in light of the
fact that the Company's financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016 were lower than both Reckitt Benckiser's initial expectations
and the consensus of Wall Street research analysts' estimates, and that the

near-term outlook for the Company was more challenging than Reckitt Benckiser had assumed in its original proposal, although Reckitt Benckiser was
unwilling to raise its offer of $90.00 in cash per share, given these developments, the Company should view Reckitt Benckiser's continued interest in
proceeding at its original offer price as a de facto increase in the relative value of Reckitt Benckiser's offer.

        On January 29, 2017, our Board held a telephonic meeting at which Mr. Cornelius provided an update on the meetings in Chicago and the
conversation between Mr. Cornelius and Mr. Kapoor two days before, in which Mr. Kapoor had been unwilling to increase Reckitt Benckiser's initial offer
of $90.00 in cash per share. Members of our senior management team, as well as representatives of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland, also attended the
meeting. Mr. Jakobsen also informed our Board that, after Mr. Kapoor had declined to increase Reckitt Benckiser's initial offer, after consulting with
Mr. Cornelius, Mr. Jakobsen had called the Chief Executive Officer of Company A as a follow-up to the inquiry Mr. Jakobsen had received from Company
A's Chief Executive Officer the prior week and that Mr. Jakobsen inquired whether Company A had progressed its assessment of whether to make an offer
for the Company. Mr. Jakobsen relayed to our Board that the Chief Executive Officer of Company A had stated that Company A had been doing
preliminary work to evaluate whether it would have an interest in exploring a potential transaction and might be in a position to share the results of that
work in about two weeks. Mr. Jakobsen explained that he had indicated to the Chief Executive Officer of Company A that, if Company A wished to ensure
that any such proposal was given appropriate consideration, it should be submitted as soon as possible. Mr. Jakobsen and a representative of Goldman
Sachs also discussed with our Board certain characteristics of Company A that they thought could complicate an effort by Company A to put forth, and
ultimately consummate, a competing proposal, including potential timing, regulatory and financing issues. Our Board then engaged in an extensive and
detailed discussion regarding appropriate next steps, including whether to continue discussions with, and provide further diligence to, Reckitt Benckiser on
the basis of its current offer. Our Board noted that Reckitt Benckiser had been very firm in its refusal to increase its offer price above $90.00 per share and
that it was the sense of our Board and its advisors based on discussions with Reckitt Benckiser to date, in particular the issues that Mr. Kapoor had
conveyed in his discussions with Mr. Cornelius on January 13 and January 27, that further attempts to seek to convince Reckitt Benckiser to increase its
offer price would not be successful and risked causing Reckitt Benckiser to withdraw its current offer and walk away from its consideration of a potential
transaction. As part of this discussion, our Board discussed, with input from representatives of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland, various alternatives that were
available to the Company, including proceeding with transaction discussions with Reckitt Benckiser on the basis of its current offer, conducting a broader
sales process or continuing on a standalone basis. Our Board discussed both the benefits and risks associated with each option, including the attractiveness
of the current offer from Reckitt Benckiser, the challenges facing the Company and the risks inherent in the Long-Range Plan. Our Board also discussed
considerations associated with conducting a broader sales process, including the timing implications and the fact that Mr. Kapoor had made it clear
previously that Reckitt Benckiser would likely withdraw its current offer and refuse to participate in any broader process. As part of this, our Board and its
advisors also discussed the universe of parties that they believed could potentially be interested in a transaction with the Company, as well as potential
regulatory and other considerations associated with such parties. During the discussion, representatives of Kirkland discussed with our Board legal
considerations associated with our Board's consideration of Reckitt Benckiser's proposal and of other alternatives potentially available to the Company.
Our Board also considered advice from its advisors that a termination fee within a customary range for transactions of this type would be unlikely to be a
meaningful deterrent to alternative acquisition proposals. Following this discussion and after considering all relevant factors, our Board determined to
proceed with discussions with Reckitt Benckiser on the basis of its offer of $90.00 in cash per share.

        From the time of Mr. Jakobsen's call to the Chief Executive Officer of Company A referred to in the prior paragraph to the signing of the merger
agreement, Company A did not submit any proposals related to a potential transaction or otherwise communicate an intention to do so.

        On January 30, 2017, Reckitt Benckiser received access to a virtual data room containing due diligence information on the Company. Beginning on
that date and continuing for the remainder of the process, we and our advisors responded to requests for additional diligence materials by having diligence
calls and meetings with Reckitt Benckiser and its advisors and by providing additional documents in the data room. Later in the day on January 30, 2017,
Reckitt Benckiser provided a draft merger agreement to the Company.

        Also on January 30, 2017, we asked Morgan Stanley to also assist in providing advice to the Company and our Board in connection with a potential
transaction involving Reckitt Benckiser or another party.

        On January 31, 2017, the Ad Hoc Committee held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management team, as well as representatives of
Kirkland, also attended the meeting. At the meeting, management and representatives from Kirkland provided an update to the Ad Hoc Committee on the
status of discussions with Reckitt Benckiser regarding a potential transaction, including the key terms contained in the draft merger agreement provided by
Reckitt Benckiser's outside legal counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, or Davis Polk, as well as potential responses, and the members of the Ad Hoc
Committee provided feedback to Kirkland regarding such terms.

        On February 1, 2017, The Wall Street Journal published a story online after market close, which was published by the newspaper the next day in print
and subsequently carried by other print and electronic publications globally, reporting that the Company and Reckitt Benckiser were in discussions for the
acquisition of the Company by Reckitt Benckiser. Following such publication, Reckitt Benckiser informed us that it was required by the U.K. rules
governing listed companies to confirm that it was in discussions with us regarding a potential transaction, and that given the results of Reckitt Benckiser's
due diligence to date, Reckitt Benckiser remained interested in continuing to pursue a possible acquisition at a price of $90.00 per share and therefore
intended to publicly confirm that. Later that same night, both the Company and Reckitt Benckiser issued press releases confirming the parties were in
discussions with respect to Reckitt Benckiser's proposal to acquire the outstanding shares of our common stock for $90.00 per share in cash. On
February 2, 2017, following the leak of the potential transaction, the Company's share price closed up 21.4% at $84.38 per share.

        From February 1, 2017 through February 3, 2017, a series of due diligence calls and meetings were held both in person in London and telephonically
between members of our management and Reckitt Benckiser management, as well as both companies' advisors. The meetings covered topics including
external affairs, information technology, human resources, quality and research and development and regulatory matters, commercial matters, financial and
accounting matters, legal matters and supply chain matters.

        On February 3, 2017, the Ad Hoc Committee held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management team, as well as representatives of
Goldman Sachs and Kirkland, attended the meeting. Mr. Jakobsen provided an update on the status of negotiations with Reckitt Benckiser and discussed
the various workstreams that would need to be completed for the parties to be able to sign a definitive agreement, and a representative of Kirkland
discussed plans for upcoming negotiations on the merger agreement.

        Later in the day on February 3, 2017, Kirkland sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Davis Polk, which agreement, among other terms,
contained a "go-shop" provision and contemplated an irrevocable undertaking from JAB committing to vote its shares of Reckitt Benckiser in favor of the
transaction at Reckitt Benckiser's stockholder meeting.

        On February 4, 2017, Davis Polk, Linklaters LLP, U.K. counsel to Reckitt Benckiser ("Linklaters") and Kirkland held a telephonic meeting to discuss
certain open points in the merger agreement, and later that day, Davis Polk sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Kirkland. Also on February 4,
2017, we provided a series of proposals relating to the treatment of equity awards and other employee compensation and retention matters (collectively, the
"Compensation and Retention Issues") (see for example the sections entitled "—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on
page 66 and "—Employee Matters" on page 94). The Compensation and Retention Issues were subject to separate discussion by specialists from the
Company and Reckitt Benckiser teams throughout the negotiation. During the course of these negotiations, we focused on the Compensation and
Retention Issues in order to ensure the smooth continuity of operations from the Company's perspective to ensure closing of the transaction would occur,
whereas Reckitt Benckiser focused on retention as it was entering a new business and felt it was important to retain our employees and in order to preserve
the value of the Company it was acquiring.

        On February 5, 2017, Davis Polk and Kirkland held a telephonic meeting to further discuss the terms of the draft merger agreement.

        Later in the day on February 5, 2017, the Ad Hoc Committee held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management team, as well as
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland, also attended the meeting. A representative of Kirkland provided the Ad Hoc Committee with an
overview of certain open points in the merger agreement, including Reckitt Benckiser's refusal to accept a "go-shop" provision, the size of the termination
fee and/or expense reimbursement payable by the Company if the transaction were terminated under certain circumstances and the universe of such
circumstances and certain open points in the merger agreement related to the Compensation and Retention Issues in connection with the potential
transaction. In addition, the Ad Hoc Committee considered issues relating to deal certainty for our stockholders in light of the requirement for Reckitt
Benckiser's stockholders to approve the transaction, including the amount of the Reckitt Benckiser termination fee if Reckitt Benckiser's stockholders
failed to approve the transaction and whether JAB, as a Reckitt Benckiser's stockholder, would agree to sign an irrevocable undertaking committing to
support the transaction. The members of the Ad Hoc Committee asked questions of Kirkland and Goldman Sachs, which were answered, and provided
input to Kirkland and Goldman Sachs on such points.

        Still later in the day on February 5, 2017, Davis Polk provided Kirkland with a draft of the facilities agreement Reckitt Benckiser anticipated entering
into at signing in order to fund a portion of the purchase price. On February 6, 2017, Kirkland provided comments on the facilities agreement via email
and subsequent teleconferences.

        On February 6, 2017, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management team, as well as representatives of Goldman Sachs
and Kirkland, also attended the meeting. At the meeting, Mr. Jakobsen relayed to our Board that, as a result of the leak on February 1, Reckitt Benckiser
had indicated a strong desire, subject to satisfactory conclusion of due diligence, reaching agreement on transaction terms and to approval by both
companies' Boards of Directors, to accelerate the timetable of the potential transaction with a goal of signing and announcing the transaction as early as
February 8. Representatives from Kirkland also provided an update to our Board on the open points in the transaction documents, which included Reckitt
Benckiser's refusal to accept a "go-shop" provision, whether JAB would sign an irrevocable undertaking committing to support the transaction, the size of
the termination fee and/or expense reimbursement payable by either party in the event the merger agreement was terminated under certain circumstances
and the Compensation and Retention Issues in connection with the potential transaction. The members of our Board discussed these and other open issues,
asked questions of Kirkland and Goldman Sachs, which were answered, and provided direction to Kirkland and Goldman Sachs on the open issues in the
transaction documents, including to agree to forego the "go-shop" provision subject to Reckitt Benckiser agreeing to a lower

Company termination fee in the event the merger agreement was terminated in connection with a superior proposal for the Company.

        On February 7, 2017, Kirkland sent a revised draft of the merger agreement to Davis Polk. Later that same day, the Ad Hoc Committee held a
meeting in Chicago, which was attended telephonically by Mr. Cornelius and Dr. Altschuler. Members of our senior management team, as well as
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Kirkland, also attended the meeting. At the meeting, representatives of Kirkland and Goldman Sachs provided an
update regarding the Company's latest proposal on the remaining open points, which had been delivered to Reckitt Benckiser the day before based on input
provided by the Ad Hoc Committee on February 5 and our Board on February 6. As part of that update, a representative from Goldman Sachs provided a
summary of a call he had with a representative of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, a financial advisor to Reckitt Benckiser, the day before to reiterate the
Company's positions on certain open items. The Ad Hoc Committee then engaged in a discussion, which included questions of and responses from
Kirkland and Goldman Sachs regarding the open points in the transaction documents. Later in the meeting, representatives of Morgan Stanley joined to
preview the financial analysis that Morgan Stanley intended to present to the full Board the following day.

        From February 7, 2017 to February 10, 2017, Davis Polk and Kirkland continued to exchange drafts of, and hold telephonic meetings, which included
representatives of Goldman Sachs on behalf of the Company, as well as representatives from Linklaters, Robey Warshaw LLP, a financial advisor to
Reckitt Benckiser, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to discuss the terms of, the merger agreement, including the Compensation and Retention Issues.

        On February 8, 2017, our Board held a meeting in Chicago, which was attended telephonically by Dr. Altschuler, Ms. Kimberly A. Casiano,
Ms. Anna C. Catalano, Mr. Stephen W. Golsby and Mr. Singer. Members of our senior management team, as well as representatives of Goldman Sachs,
Morgan Stanley and Kirkland, also attended the meeting, other than an executive session at the end of the meeting, for which neither Goldman Sachs,
Morgan Stanley nor members of the management team were present. At the meeting, the Company's advisors updated our Board on the status of the
negotiation of the transaction with Reckitt Benckiser, and reported that among the open issues was whether JAB would provide an irrevocable undertaking
to support the transaction, the size of the termination fee and/or expense reimbursement payable by either party in the event the merger agreement was
terminated under certain circumstances and the Compensation and Retention Issues in connection with the potential transaction. Our Board provided
guidance to management and the Company's advisors on the remaining open points, including by directing Kirkland and Goldman Sachs to continue
requesting that JAB enter into an undertaking, but also to hold firm in requiring Reckitt Benckiser to agree to a termination fee payable in the event the
Reckitt Benckiser stockholders did not approve that would be sufficiently high to increase deal certainty for our stockholders. Our Board also discussed
other relationships of the financial advisors and members of our Board and whether any of them posed a potential conflict. For more information on
Goldman Sachs' and Morgan Stanley's relationships see the sections entitled "—Opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co." beginning on page 49 and "—Opinion
of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC" beginning on page 57. After discussion, our Board determined that none of the matters disclosed to our Board by Morgan
Stanley or Goldman Sachs would be material to such advisors' ability to serve as financial advisors to our Board. In addition, Mr. Singer reminded the
other members of our Board that he served on the board of directors of three companies controlled by JAB, in respect of which he received directors' fees,
and received consulting fees from an entity owned by JAB. After discussion, our Board determined Mr. Singer's relationship with JAB would not impair
his ability to exercise his duties as a director of the Company in the context of a potential transaction and therefore should not preclude Mr. Singer from
participating in our Board's determination of whether to proceed with the potential transaction or otherwise. Next Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
each reviewed the separate financial analyses they had prepared related to the potential transaction, highlighting key valuation methods and financial
metrics that had

been prepared and analyzed as part of each of Goldman Sachs' and Morgan Stanley's independent evaluation of the transaction.

        On February 9, 2017, our Board held a telephonic meeting. Members of our senior management team, as well as representatives of Goldman Sachs,
Morgan Stanley and Kirkland, attended the meeting. Representatives of Kirkland led a discussion regarding the proposed resolution of various open points
that had been discussed with the Board the prior day. Representatives of Goldman Sachs then delivered Goldman Sachs' oral opinion to our Board (which
opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 10, 2017), to the effect that, as of February 10, 2017, and based upon
and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth in its written opinion, the $90.00 in cash per share to be paid to holders (other than Reckitt Benckiser
and its affiliates) of outstanding shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley then delivered Morgan Stanley's oral opinion to our Board (which opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of
a written opinion, dated February 9, 2017), to the effect that, as of the date of the Board meeting and based upon and subject to the assumptions made,
procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in its written
opinion, the $90.00 in cash per share to be received by the holders (other than Reckitt Benckiser and its affiliates) of outstanding shares of our common
stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Our Board then unanimously determined, for the reasons
detailed in the section entitled "—Reasons for the Merger" below, that the merger was fair to and in the best interests of our stockholders, approved,
adopted and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and recommended the adoption of the merger agreement
by our stockholders.

        On February 10, 2017, the parties executed the merger agreement and Reckitt Benckiser simultaneously entered into the facilities agreement. For
more information, see the section entitled "—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 66.

        In the morning London time on February 10, 2017, Reckitt Benckiser and the Company each released separate press releases to announce the signing
of the merger agreement.

Reasons for the Merger 

        Our Board considered a number of factors in making its determination that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, including the following (not necessarily in the order of relative
importance):

        Merger consideration.    Our Board considered the $90.00 per share in cash to be paid as merger consideration in relation to our Board's estimate of
the current and future value of the Company as an independent entity, including that the total enterprise value of the transaction is approximately
$17.9 billion, representing a multiple of 17.4x 2016 non-GAAP EBITDA.

        Premium.    Our Board considered that the $90.00 per share in cash to be paid as merger consideration represents a premium of approximately 29% to
the closing price of our common stock on February 1, 2017, the last trading day before the Company and Reckitt Benckiser publicly confirmed they were
in discussions for the acquisition of the Company by Reckitt Benckiser at a price of $90.00 per share.

        Cash consideration.    Our Board considered the fact that the merger consideration would be paid solely in cash, which provides certainty and
immediate liquidity and value to our stockholders, enabling our stockholders to realize value that has been created at the Company while eliminating long-
term business and execution risk.

        Strategic alternatives.    Our Board considered the potential values, benefits, risks and uncertainties facing our stockholders associated with possible
strategic alternatives to the merger (including scenarios involving the possibility of remaining independent), and the timing and likelihood of
accomplishing certain alternatives, taking into account potential regulatory challenges with respect to an acquisition of the Company by certain
competitors of the Company in the infant nutrition industry. Based on the foregoing, our Board considered that none of these options, on a risk-adjusted
basis, was reasonably likely to create value for our stockholders greater than the merger consideration. Our Board also considered the Company's ability,
subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, to respond to, engage in discussions or negotiations regarding, and ultimately accept a
superior proposal from a person other than Reckitt Benckiser under certain circumstances and, in the case of accepting such a superior proposal, after
paying a termination fee, as more fully described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation of an Acquisition Proposal; Company
Adverse Recommendation Change" beginning on page 88.

        Fairness Opinion.    Our Board considered the financial analyses presented by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as:

• Goldman Sachs' oral opinion to our Board (which opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion), to the effect that,
as of February 10, 2017, and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the $90.00 in cash per share to be paid
to holders (other than Reckitt Benckiser and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The opinion of Goldman Sachs is more fully described in the section entitled "—
Opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co." beginning on page 49 and the full text of such opinion is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B;
and 

• Morgan Stanley's oral opinion to our Board (which opinion was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion), to the effect that,
as of February 9, 2017 and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications
and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth therein, the $90.00 in cash per share to be received by the
holders (other than Reckitt Benckiser and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement
was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The opinion of Morgan Stanley is more fully described in the section entitled "—
Opinion of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC" beginning on page 57, and the full text of such opinion is attached to this proxy statement as
Annex C.

        Negotiations with Reckitt Benckiser.    Our Board considered the beneficial terms that we and our advisors were able to obtain during extensive
negotiations with Reckitt Benckiser and that the merger agreement was the product of arm's-length negotiations and contained terms and conditions that
were, in our Board's view, advisable and favorable to the Company and our stockholders.

        Timing of Reckitt Benckiser's Offer.    The timing and the risk that if we did not accept Reckitt Benckiser's offer, which Reckitt Benckiser had
consistently indicated was the highest offer it would make, our Board may not have another opportunity to do so.

        Our Current Condition.    Our Board considered information with respect to our financial condition, results of operation, competitive position and
business strategy, on both historical and prospective bases, as well as current industry, regulatory, economic and market conditions, trends and cycles.

        Our Future Prospects.    Our Board considered our future prospects if we were to remain independent, including the competitive landscape and the
business, financial and execution risks, our relationship with clients, physicians, providers and suppliers, and the risk associated with continued
independence discussed below.

Table of Contents

        Risks Associated with Continued Independence.    While our Board remained supportive of our strategic plan and optimistic about our prospects on a
standalone basis, it also considered the risks associated with operating as a standalone company, including the potential execution risks associated with the
strategic plan, the achievability of financial projections and the potential risk the market may not reflect such execution in our stock price. Our Board also
considered continuing headwinds facing the business, including the impact on net sales of a stronger U.S. dollar and slowing economic growth in certain
markets. Our Board concluded that the merger consideration enabled our stockholders to realize the Company's potential future value without the market
or execution risks associated with continued independence.

        Merger Agreement.    Our Board considered, in consultation with counsel, the terms of the merger agreement, including:

• the right of the Company and our Board to respond to a competing superior proposal from any bidder prior to obtaining the our stockholder
approval if our Board determines in good faith, after considering advice from its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
acquisition proposal either constitutes a superior proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal, and that failure
to take such action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under Delaware law, as well as our
ability to terminate the merger agreement to accept a superior proposal, subject to certain notice requirements and "matching rights" in
favor of Reckitt Benckiser and provided that we pay Reckitt Benckiser the applicable termination fee; 

• our Board's belief that termination fee provisions are customary for transactions of this type, and its belief that the $480 million termination
fee with respect to terminations made for superior proposals was reasonable in the context of comparable transactions and the likelihood
that a fee of such sizes would not be a meaningful deterrent to alternative acquisition proposals; 

• our Board's right to change its recommendation whether in connection with a superior proposal, or otherwise, prior to obtaining our
stockholder approval if our Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and, in the case of a
superior proposal, its financial advisor, that the failure to make such change in recommendation would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware law, subject to certain notice requirements and "matching rights"; 

• the representations, warranties and covenants of the parties, the limited conditions to the parties' obligations to complete the merger and
their ability to terminate the merger agreement; 

• the fact that the consummation of the merger is not conditioned on Reckitt Benckiser's ability to obtain financing; 

• the fact that the Company has sufficient operating flexibility to conduct its business in the ordinary course between the execution of the
merger agreement and consummation of the merger; 

• the obligation of Reckitt Benckiser under certain circumstances to pay the Company a reverse termination fee of $480 million in the event
that Reckitt Benckiser stockholders do not approve the merger or the Reckitt Benckiser Board of Directors changes its recommendation; 

• the fact that the definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect" has a number of customary exceptions, as described in detail in the
section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Merger" beginning on page 95, and is generally a very high standard as applied
by the courts; and 

• the Company's right to specifically enforce Reckitt Benckiser's obligations under the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

        Financing.    Our Board considered the fact that Reckitt Benckiser has obtained committed debt financing for the transaction from reputable financial
institutions, and that Reckitt Benckiser had approximately £882 million in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and an
investment grade credit rating.

        Likelihood of Consummation.    Our Board considered the level of commitment by Reckitt Benckiser to obtain the applicable consents imposed by
regulators in connection with securing such approvals, as well as the likelihood that the merger would be completed, in light of, among other things, the
conditions to the merger and the absence of a financing condition, the relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals, and the remedies
available to us under the merger agreement.

        Reckitt Benckiser's reputation.    Our Board considered the business reputation and capabilities of Reckitt Benckiser and its management, and Reckitt
Benckiser's general ability to complete an acquisition transaction of this size.

        Appraisal Rights.    Our Board considered the fact that stockholders who do not vote to adopt the merger agreement and who comply with the
requirements of Delaware law will have the right to dissent from the merger and to demand appraisal of the fair value of their shares under Delaware law.

        Stockholders' Ability to Reject the Merger.    Our Board considered the fact that the merger is subject to the adoption of the merger agreement by the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote thereon.

        In the course of reaching its decision, our Board also considered a number of potentially negative factors with respect to the merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement including, among others, the following (not necessarily in the order of relative importance):

        Reckitt Benckiser Stockholders' Ability to Reject the Merger.    Our Board considered the fact that the merger is subject to the approval of the merger
by a majority of the Reckitt Benckiser stockholders. Our Board also considered that the Reckitt Benckiser's board of directors may change its
recommendation under certain circumstances.

        Participation in Future Gains.    Our Board considered the fact that, if the merger is completed, we will no longer exist as an independent public
company and our stockholders will forgo any future increase in the Company's value that might result from our earnings or possible growth as an
independent company. Our Board recognized the growth and profitability prospects for the Company on a standalone basis, but concluded that the
premium reflected in the merger consideration constituted fair compensation for the loss of the potential stockholder benefits that could be realized by our
strategic plan, particularly on a risk-adjusted basis.

        Regulatory Risk.    Our Board considered the risk that the necessary regulatory approvals, the receipt of which is beyond the Company's control, may
be delayed, conditioned or denied.

        Risks Associated with a Failure to Consummate the Merger.    Our Board considered the fact that there can be no assurance that all conditions to the
parties' obligations to consummate the merger will be satisfied and as a result the possibility that the merger might not be completed, and the fact that any
reverse termination fee may not fully compensate the Company for the costs of non-consummation in the circumstances in which it is payable. Our Board
noted the fact that, if the merger is not completed, (i) we will have incurred significant risk, transaction expenses and opportunity costs, including the
possibility of disruption to our operations, diversion of management and employee attention, employee attrition and a potentially negative effect on our
business and client relationships, (ii) depending on the circumstances that caused the merger not to be completed, it is likely that the price of our common
stock will decline, potentially significantly and (iii) the market's perception of our prospects could be adversely affected.

Table of Contents

        Restrictions on the Operation of Our Business.    Our Board considered the restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the
merger, including restrictions on realizing certain business opportunities or taking certain actions with respect to our operations we may otherwise take
absent the pending merger.

        Non-Solicitation Provision.    Our Board considered the fact that the merger agreement precludes us from actively soliciting alternative proposals.

        Termination Fee.    Our Board considered the possibility that the $480 million termination fee payable to Reckitt Benckiser with respect to
termination for a superior proposal might have the effect of discouraging alternative acquisition proposals or reducing the price of such proposals.

        Reckitt Benckiser Termination Fee.    Our Board considered the fact that, except in the case of fraud, the Company's sole monetary remedy in
circumstances in which the termination fee is payable and paid in connection with a breach of the merger agreement by Reckitt Benckiser or Merger Sub is
the amount of the $480 million termination fee plus any costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Company in connection with enforcing the payment of
such termination fee (plus interest at the prime rate if any such amounts are not paid when due), and may not be sufficient to compensate the Company for
losses suffered as a result of a breach of the merger agreement by Reckitt Benckiser or Merger Sub.

        Tax Treatment.    Our Board considered the fact that any gains arising from the receipt of the merger consideration would generally be taxable to our
stockholders that are U.S. holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        Stockholder Litigation.    Our Board considered the likelihood of distracting litigation from stockholder suits in connection with the merger.

        After considering potentially positive and potentially negative factors, our Board concluded that, overall, the potentially positive factors outweighed
the potentially negative factors. Accordingly, our Board unanimously determined that the merger, merger agreement and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.

        The foregoing discussion is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the information and factors considered by our Board in its consideration of the
merger, but includes the material positive factors and material negative factors considered by our Board in that regard. In view of the number and variety
of factors and the amount of information considered, our Board did not find it practicable to, nor did it attempt to, make specific assessments of, quantify,
or otherwise assign relative weights to, the specific factors considered in reaching its determination. In addition, individual members of our Board may
have given different weights to different factors. Based on the totality of the information presented, our Board reached the unanimous decision to approve,
adopt and declare advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, the merger, the merger agreement and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement in light of the factors described above and other factors that the members of our Board deemed were
appropriate.

        Portions of this explanation of our reasons for the merger and other information presented in this section are forward-looking in nature and, therefore,
should be read in light of the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" beginning on page 21.

Recommendation of Our Board 

        After due consideration and discussion of the factors that our Board deemed relevant to enable it to reach an informed decision as to the fairness and
advisability of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the factors discussed in the above subsection "—Reasons for the
Merger", our Board unanimously (i) determined that the merger agreement and the transactions

contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, (ii) approved, adopted and declared
advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and (iii) recommended adoption of the merger agreement by
our stockholders.

        Our Board unanimously recommends that you vote (1) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, (2) "FOR" the Adjournment
Proposal and (3) "FOR" the non-binding, advisory Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.

Unaudited Prospective Financial Information 

        Our management prepares projections of the Company's expected financial performance as part of its ongoing management of the business.
Other than guidance in connection with its regularly-scheduled earnings releases, these projections are not disclosed as a matter of course due to
the inherent unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, the Company is including in this proxy statement to provide
our stockholders access to a summary of certain unaudited prospective financial information that was prepared by our management and used by
our Board and Reckitt Benckiser in connection with their respective evaluations of the proposed merger and, following its review and approval by
our Board, by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the financial advisors to the Company, in providing financial advice to our Board. The
inclusion of this information should not be regarded as an indication that any of the Company, Reckitt Benckiser, Goldman Sachs, Morgan
Stanley, their respective representatives or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers, it necessarily to be predictive of
actual future results, or that it should be construed as financial guidance, and it should not be relied on as such. Our management prepared these
projections, which were reviewed and approved by our Board at its January 22, 2017 meeting and subsequently provided by the Company to
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for use in the preparation of the opinions of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley rendered orally to our
Board at its February 9, 2017 meeting (with such opinions subsequently confirmed by delivery of Goldman Sachs' and Morgan Stanley's written
opinions on February 10 and February 9, respectively). The only projections used by our Board in resolving to approve the transaction with
Reckitt Benckiser were the projections included in the Long-Range Plan, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley did not use or rely on any
projections other than those included in the Long-Range Plan to perform any of the financial analysis undertaken in connection with their
respective fairness opinions.

        Our management, as part of ordinary course strategic and operational planning for its business, develops multi-year financial projections based on its
evolving strategy, results and actions. As part of such process, our management prepared, and our Board approved at its June 9-10, 2016 meeting, the June
2016 Projections. In early December 2016, as a result of underperformance relative to the Company's 2016 budget since the June 2016 Board meeting, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer determined to update the 2017 budget and long-range projections that had been included in the June
2016 Projections to present to our Board for approval at its January 22, 2017 meeting. At the time the Company received Reckitt Benckiser's non-binding
January 13, 2017 proposal to acquire the Company, our management was in the process of preparing this update, and it was this near final update to the
June 2016 Projections that the Company provided to Goldman Sachs and instructed Goldman Sachs to use for purposes of the preliminary valuation
analysis Goldman Sachs delivered to our Board at its January 18, 2017 meeting. Our management then completed its work and sent a proposed Long-
Range Plan to our Board on January 20, 2017. Following review and approval by our Board at its January 22, 2017 meeting, the Long-Range Plan was
provided by the Company to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for use in the preparation of the opinions of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley
rendered orally to our Board at its February 9, 2017 meeting (with such opinions subsequently confirmed by delivery of Goldman Sachs' and Morgan
Stanley's written opinions on

February 10 and February 9, respectively). The primary differences between the projections included in the preliminary update to the June 2016
Projections that were utilized by Goldman Sachs at the January 18, 2017 Board meeting and the projections included in the Long-Range Plan are described
in footnote (7) to the first table set forth below. The primary differences between the June 2016 Projections and the Long-Range Plan are described in
footnote (8) to the first table set forth below.

        While presented with numeric specificity, the unaudited prospective financial information reflects numerous estimates and assumptions made with
respect to business, economic, market, competition, regulatory and financial conditions and matters specific to the Company's business, all of which are
difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company's control. The unaudited prospective financial information reflects both assumptions as to
certain business decisions that are subject to change and, in many respects, subjective judgment, and thus is susceptible to multiple interpretations and
periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The Company can give no assurance that the unaudited prospective financial
information or the underlying estimates and assumptions will be realized. In addition, since the unaudited prospective financial information covers
multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. Furthermore, the unaudited prospective financial
information should not be construed as commentary by our management as to how our management expects the Company's actual results to compare to
Wall Street research analysts' estimates, as to which the Company expresses no view.

        Actual results may differ materially from those set forth below, and important factors that may affect actual results and cause the unaudited
prospective financial information to be inaccurate include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the Company's business, industry
performance, general business and economic conditions, customer requirements, competition and adverse changes in applicable laws, regulations or rules.
For other factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"
beginning on page 21 and the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Statements" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and the other reports filed by the Company with the SEC. Given the proposed merger under the merger agreement
with Reckitt Benckiser and assuming that such merger is completed, the unaudited prospective financial information for the Company as a standalone
entity for the years 2018 to 2021 set forth below will no longer be applicable.

        The unaudited prospective financial information does not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date it was prepared. The
Company can give no assurance that, had the unaudited prospective financial information been prepared as of the date of this proxy statement, similar
estimates and assumptions would be used. The Company does not intend to, and disclaims any obligation to, make publicly available any update or
other revision to the unaudited prospective financial information to reflect circumstances existing since its preparation or to reflect the
occurrence of unanticipated events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the unaudited prospective financial
information are shown to be in error, or to reflect changes in general economic or industry conditions. The unaudited prospective financial
information does not take into account the possible financial and other effects on the Company of the merger and does not attempt to predict or suggest
future results of the combined company. The unaudited prospective financial information does not give effect to the merger, including the impact of
negotiating or executing the merger agreement, the expenses that may be incurred in connection with consummating the merger or the potential synergies
that may be achieved by the combined company as a result of the merger. Further, the unaudited prospective financial information does not take into
account the effect on the Company of any possible failure of the merger to occur. None of the Company, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley or their
respective affiliates, officers, directors, advisors or other representatives has made, makes or is authorized in the future to make any representation to any
Company stockholder or other person regarding the Company's ultimate performance compared to the information contained in the

(1) Amounts in this section were prepared based on exchange rates used by the Company for the purpose of its 2017 budget process. 

(2) Adjusted Operating Expenses represents operating expenses adjusted in 2017 to exclude an estimated $25 million of charges related
to Fuel for Growth and Real Estate Consolidation. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for additional information on these
charges. The most comparable GAAP measure is Operating Expenses. 

(3) Adjusted EBIT represents earnings before net interest expenses and income taxes adjusted in 2017 to exclude an estimated
$25 million of charges related to Fuel for Growth and Real Estate Consolidation. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for
additional information on these charges. The most comparable GAAP measure is Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes. 

(4) Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expenses, income taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted in 2017
for an estimated $25 million of charges related to Fuel for Growth and Real Estate Consolidation. See "Non-GAAP Financial
Measures" below for additional information on these charges. The most comparable GAAP measure is Earnings before Interest and
Income Taxes. 

(5) Adjusted EPS (Incl. One Time Tax Benefit) represents net earnings attributable to shareholders reduced by dividends and
undistributed earnings attributable to unvested shares divided by the weighted average shares outstanding adjusted for the effect of
dilutive stock options and performance share awards. In 2017, expected GAAP EPS has been adjusted to exclude an estimated
$0.09 of charges related to Fuel for Growth and Real Estate Consolidation. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for
additional information on these charges. 2017 also includes a potential one time tax benefit estimated to be $0.15. The most
comparable GAAP measure is diluted earnings per share. Adjusted EPS (Incl. One Time Tax Benefit) includes a $0.20 per share
negative currency impact. 

(6) Adjusted EPS (Excl. One Time Tax Benefit) represents net earnings attributable to shareholders reduced by dividends and
undistributed earnings attributable to unvested shares divided by the weighted average shares outstanding adjusted for the effect of
dilutive stock options and

performance share awards. 2017 expected GAAP EPS has been adjusted to exclude an estimated $0.09 of charges related to Fuel
for Growth and Real Estate Consolidation. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for additional information on these
charges. 2017 excludes a potential one time tax benefit estimated to be $0.15. The most comparable GAAP measure is diluted
earnings per share. Adjusted EPS (Excl. One Time Tax Benefit) includes a $0.20 per share negative currency impact.

(7) Unlevered Free Cash Flow represents Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes less unlevered income tax expense, plus
depreciation and amortization, less capital expenditures, and changes in net working capital accounts (in each case based on income
statement, balance sheet and cash flow data provided by the Company as part of the Long Range Plan). The most comparable
GAAP measure is Earnings before Interest and Income Taxes. Goldman Sachs used the internal projections provided by the
Company to calculate the following estimates of Unlevered Free Cash Flow that were approved by the Company for use by
Goldman Sachs in its analyses: $546 million for 2017, $743 million for 2018, $798 million for 2019, $825 million for 2020 and
$890 million for 2021. Morgan Stanley used the internal projections provided by the Company to calculate the following estimates
of Unlevered Free Cash Flow that were approved by the Company for use by Morgan Stanley in its analyses: $532 million for
2017, $738 million for 2018, $798 million for 2019, $825 million for 2020 and $890 million for 2021. The difference between the
Unlevered Free Cash Flow estimates calculated by Goldman Sachs and the Unlevered Free Cash Flow estimates calculated by
Morgan Stanley is attributable to differences in their calculation of changes in net working capital. Goldman Sachs, with the
approval of the Company, used the Company's internal projections for accounts receivable, inventory, other current operating
assets, accounts payable and other current operating liabilities to calculate changes in net working capital, while Morgan Stanley,
with the approval of the Company, used the Company's internal projections for accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable
to calculate changes in net working capital. 

(8) The preliminary update to the June 2016 Projections differed from the Long-Range Plan in three primary respects. First, the
preliminary update to the June 2016 Projections did not include figures for 2021. Second, the Long-Range Plan included a figure
for Adjusted EPS (Inc. One Time Tax Benefit) in 2017 that was 4.69% higher than such figure in the preliminary update to the June
2016 Projections, as well as certain variances that resulted in such increase. This difference was as a result of the preliminary
update to the June 2016 Projections not including a $0.15 per share positive impact due to the potential one time tax benefit
described in footnotes (4) and (5) above. Third, the Long-Range Plan included a figure for Adjusted EPS (Inc. One Time Tax
Benefit) in 2020 that was 1.56% lower than the figure included in the preliminary update to the June 2016 Projections, as well as
certain variances that resulted in such decrease. This difference was as a result of the preliminary update to the June 2016
Projections including a lower assumption with respect to operating expenses in 2020 than was included in the Long-Range Plan. 

(9) The Long-Range Plan differs from the June 2016 Projections in certain material respects. The primary differences were driven by,
among other things, updates to the June 2016 Projections to reflect a decrease in 2016 actual performance versus budgeted
performance, a downward revision to the Company's projected financial performance for 2017 and anticipated costs in connection
with the launch of new products and anticipated changes in the business model in certain geographies. As a result of these
developments, the Adjusted EPS (Inc. One Time Tax Benefit) figures for 2017, 2018 and 2021 that are set forth in the Long Range
Plan were 14.84%, 17.51% and 11.02% lower, respectively, than the Adjusted EPS (Inc. One Time Tax Benefit) figures set forth in
the June 2016 Projections, with associated decreases in other line items that form a part of Adjusted EPS (Inc. One Time Tax
Benefit).

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

        Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS (Incl. One Time Tax Benefit) and Adjusted EPS (Excl. One Time
Tax Benefit) are non-GAAP financial measures. Our management uses these measures to evaluate the underlying performance and efficiency of its
operations. Our management believes these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful additional information about the operating performance of the
Company's business and facilitate a meaningful comparison of its results because these non-GAAP measures exclude certain items that may not be
indicative of the Company's core operating results and business outlook. Reconciliation of Profit, Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EPS (Incl. One Time Tax Benefit) and Adjusted EPS (Excl. One Time Tax Benefit) to their respective most comparable GAAP
measure are as follows:

        Non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance
with GAAP, including net income. The Company's calculations of these non-GAAP measures may differ from others in its industry and are not necessarily
comparable with information presented under similar sounding captions used by other companies.

        The unaudited prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor was it prepared with a view toward
compliance with GAAP, published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for
preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, nor any other
independent accountants, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the unaudited prospective financial information contained
herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability. The independent registered public
accountant reports incorporated by reference into this proxy statement relate to the Company's historical financial information. They do not extend to the
unaudited prospective financial information and should not be read to do so.

        In light of the foregoing, and considering that the Company's special meeting will be held after the unaudited prospective financial information was
prepared, as well as the uncertainties inherent in any forecasted information, Company stockholders are cautioned not to place unwarranted reliance on
such information, and the Company urges all Company stockholders to review the Company's most recent SEC filings for a description of the Company's
reported financial results. See the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information" on page 114.

Opinion of Goldman, Sachs & Co. 

        We retained Goldman Sachs to act as our financial advisor in connection with a possible business transaction involving the Company. In connection
with the merger, at the special meeting of our Board on February 9, 2017, Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion dated February 10, 2017, to our Board that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set
forth therein, the $90.00 per share in cash to be paid to the holders (other than Reckitt Benckiser and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of our common
stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

        The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated February 10, 2017, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B.
Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of our Board in connection with its consideration of the merger. The
Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any holder of our common stock should vote with respect to the merger, or any other
matter.

        In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other
things:

• the merger agreement;

(5) One-Time Tax Benefit per Share related to our management's expectation of tax savings in 2017 associated with a lower effective
tax rate.

• annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the Company for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2015; 

• certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company; 

• certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders; 

• certain publicly available research analyst reports for the Company; and 

• certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by our management discussed in the section entitled "—
Unaudited Prospective Financial Information" beginning on page 44, as approved for Goldman Sachs' use by our Board, which are
referred to as the "Forecasts."

        Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of our senior management regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations,
financial condition, and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for our common stock; compared certain
financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded;
reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the infant nutrition and food and beverage industries; and performed such other
studies and analyses, and considered such other factors, as it deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of rendering this opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the Company's consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all
of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility
for independent verification thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the Company's consent that the Forecasts were reasonably prepared on a
basis reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of our management. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or
appraisal of the assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and it was not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents
and approvals necessary for the completion of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the merger in any way
meaningful to its analysis. Goldman Sachs also assumed that the merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the
waiver or modification of any term or condition, the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.

        Goldman Sachs' opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the merger or the relative merits of the
merger as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters.
Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination
with, the Company or any other alternative transaction. Goldman Sachs' opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date of
the opinion, of the $90.00 per share in cash to be paid to the holders (other than Reckitt Benckiser and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of our
common stock pursuant to the merger agreement.

        Goldman Sachs' opinion does not express any view on, and does not address, any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the merger or any
term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the merger,
including the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or
other constituencies of the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers,
directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons in connection with the merger, whether relative to the $90.00 per share in cash to be paid
to the holders (other than Reckitt

Benckiser and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. In addition, Goldman Sachs
does not express any opinion as to the impact of the merger on the solvency or viability of the Company or Reckitt Benckiser or the ability of the
Company or Reckitt Benckiser to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs' opinion was necessarily based on economic,
monetary, market and other conditions, as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed
no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of its opinion.
Goldman Sachs' opinion was approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs.

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to our Board in connection with rendering the opinion
described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Goldman Sachs,
nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a
complete description of Goldman Sachs' financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based
on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before February 1, 2017, the last trading day before the Company's and Reckitt Benckiser's
public confirmation of advanced negotiations of the merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

        Historical Stock Trading Analysis.    Goldman Sachs reviewed the historical trading prices and volumes for our common stock for the 52-week period
through the close of trading on February 1, 2017. In addition, Goldman Sachs analyzed the consideration to be paid to holders of our common stock
pursuant to the merger agreement in relation to the high and low intra-day trading prices per share of our common stock for the 52-week period through
the close of trading on February 1, 2017 (the "52-week high" and the "52-week low"), the volume weighted average intra-day trading prices per share of
our common stock for the 30 trading-day and 60 trading-day periods through the close of trading on February 1, 2017 (the "30-day VWAP" and the "60-
day VWAP"), and the closing trading price per share of our common stock on February 1, 2017 (the "undisturbed price").

        This analysis indicated that the price per share to be paid to the Company stockholders pursuant to the merger agreement represented:

• a discount of 4.7% to the 52-week high of $94.40 per share; 

• a premium of 35.0% to the 52-week low of $66.66 per share; 

• a premium of 24.6% to the 30-day VWAP of $72.23 per share; 

• a premium of 24.4% to the 60-day VWAP of $72.32 per share; and 

• a premium of 29.5% to the undisturbed price of $69.50 per share.

        Selected Companies Analysis.    Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial information for the Company to corresponding financial
information, ratios and public market multiples for the following publicly traded corporations in the food and beverage industry (collectively referred to as
the "selected companies" for purposes of this section entitled "Selected Companies Analysis"):

• Campbell Soup Company; 

• Coca-Cola Company;

• Nestlé Group; 

• PepsiCo, Inc.; and 

• Unilever plc.

        Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to the Company, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly
traded companies with operations that Goldman Sachs considered, based on its professional judgment and for purposes of this analysis, to be similar to
certain operations of the Company.

        Goldman Sachs calculated and compared financial multiples and ratios for the selected companies and for the Company using information it obtained
from SEC filings, estimates from the Institutional Brokers' Estimate System, which we refer to as "IBES" estimates, and median estimates of 14 research
brokers that published research reports between the release of the Company's fourth quarter financial results and February 1, 2017, which we refer to as
"Consensus" estimates, and market data as of February 1, 2017. With respect to each of the selected companies and the Company, Goldman Sachs
calculated the applicable company's implied price to estimated earnings ratios, which we refer to as the "P/E Multiple," by dividing the price per share of
the relevant company (calculated using the closing price per share of the applicable company's common stock as of February 1, 2017 and, in the case of
the Company, $90.00 per share) by the estimated earnings per share of the relevant company for 2017 per IBES estimates for each of the selected
companies and per Consensus estimates for the Company. In addition, Goldman Sachs calculated the applicable company's enterprise value, which we
refer to as "EV" (calculated using the closing price of shares of the applicable company's stock as of February 1, 2017 and, in the case of the Company,
$90.00 per share), as a multiple of estimated earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which we refer to as "EV/EBITDA
Multiple", for the calendar year 2017 per IBES estimates for each of the selected companies and per Consensus estimates for the Company. The results of
this review are summarized in the following tables:

        Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis.    Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the
future value per share of our common stock (including the present value of projected dividends), which is designed to provide an indication of the present
value of a theoretical future value of a company's equity as a function of such company's estimated future earnings, projected dividends and assumed price
to future earnings per share multiple. For this analysis, Goldman Sachs used the Forecasts for each of the fiscal years 2018 to 2021. Goldman Sachs first
calculated the implied future values per share of our common stock as of the end of each of the fiscal years 2017 to 2020 by applying price to forward
earnings per share multiples of 20.0x to 22.0x earnings per share of our common stock estimates for each of the fiscal years 2018 to 2021, which multiples
were selected based upon Goldman Sachs' professional judgment and experience, and then discounted these future values per share and projected
dividends to determine the implied present values as of February 1, 2017, using an illustrative discount rate of 8.8%, reflecting Goldman Sachs' estimate of
the Company's cost of equity. This analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of $67.50 to $82.00 per share of our common stock (rounded to
the nearest $0.25).

        Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis.    Using the Forecasts, Goldman Sachs performed an illustrative discounted cash flow analysis on the
Company. Using discount rates ranging from 7.75% to 8.25%, reflecting estimates of the Company's weighted average cost of capital, Goldman Sachs
discounted to present value as of December 31, 2016, (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow, for the years 2017 through 2021, as reflected in the
Forecasts and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for the Company, which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.75%
to 3.25%, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow to be generated by the Company, as reflected in the Forecasts. The calculation of
unlevered fresh cash flows, as used by Goldman Sachs in its analysis, is described in the section entitled "—Unaudited Prospective Financial Information"
beginning on page 44.

        Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for the Company by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman
Sachs then subtracted from this range of illustrative enterprise values the $1.23 billion of net debt and non-controlling interest of the Company as of
December 31, 2016, as provided by our management, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for the Company. Goldman Sachs then divided the
range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted shares of our common stock, as provided by the our management to derive a
range of illustrative present values per share ranging from $75.50 to $92.50 (rounded to the nearest $0.25).

        Selected Transactions Analysis.    Goldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to the following selected transactions in the infant nutrition
industry since January 1, 2000:

• Nestlé Group/Pfizer Nutrition (announced April 2012); 

• Groupe Danone S.A./Royal Numico N.V. (announced July 2007); 

• Nestlé Group/Gerber (announced April 2007);

• Royal Numico N.V./EAC Nutrition (announced November 2005); and 

• Royal Numico N.V./Mellin S.p.A. (announced February 2005).

        Goldman Sachs also analyzed certain information relating to the following selected transactions in the food and beverage industry involving
consideration greater than $5 billion since January 1, 2000:

• Groupe Danone S.A./Whitewave Foods Co. (announced July 2016); 

• Anheuser-Busch InBev NV/SAB Miller plc (announced July 2016);

• Unilever plc/Bestfoods Corporation (announced June 2000).

        For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared EV/EBITDA based on the target's EBITDA for the last 12 months
(LTM EBITDA) as most recently disclosed publicly at the time of the announcement of the transaction, except, due to the unavailability of LTM EBITDA,
Goldman Sachs used actual 2011 EBITDA for Pfizer Nutrition, estimated 2007 EBITDA for Gerber, estimated 2006 EBITDA for Novartis Medical
Nutrition, actual 2004 earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) for Mellin S.p.A, annualized third quarter 2005 EBITA for EAC Nutrition
and actual calendar year 2006 EBITDA for Danone Biscuits. The foregoing estimated EBITDA and EBITA figures were calculated using information
Goldman Sachs obtained from public filings.

        While none of the target companies in the selected transactions are directly comparable to the Company, the target companies in the selected
transactions are companies with operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of the Company's results, market size
and product profile.

Table of Contents

        The following tables present the results of the analysis relating to the selected transactions in the food and beverage industry:

 

        Goldman Sachs identified an illustrative range of EV/LTM EBITDA Multiples of 15.5x to 20.7x using the median EV/EBITDA Multiples of the food
and beverage and infant nutrition industries. Goldman Sachs then applied the 15.5x to 20.7x range of EV/ EBITDA Multiples to the Company's estimated
EBITDA for calendar year 2016 (adjusted to take into account certain non-recurring items/charges as identified by the Company), as provided by our
management, which resulted in a range of illustrative prices per share of our common stock of $79.50 to $108.00 (rounded to the nearest $0.25).

        Selected Historical Premia Analysis.    Goldman Sachs reviewed and analyzed, using publicly available data, those acquisition premia for all-cash
acquisition transactions announced during the time period from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2016, involving a public company based in the United
States as the target where the disclosed enterprise values for the transaction exceeded $5.0 billion. Announced premia were calculated relative to the
target's closing share price one day prior to announcement. The analysis excluded transactions with premia greater than 200%. The analysis indicated a
first quartile, median and third quartile one-day stock premia of 20.2%, 28.9% and 41.3%, respectively. Goldman Sachs then multiplied the 20.2%—
41.3% range of premia by the closing price of $69.50 per share of our common stock as of February 1, 2017, which resulted in an illustrative range of
prices per share of our common stock of $83.50 to $98.00 (rounded to the nearest $0.25).

        The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting
portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes
underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not
attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather, Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its
experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the above analyses as a
comparison is directly comparable to the Company or the merger.

        Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs' providing its opinion to our Board as to the fairness from a financial point of
view to the holders of the outstanding shares

(other than Reckitt Benckiser and its affiliates) of our common stock of the $90.00 per share in cash to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger
agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold.
Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable
than suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the
control of the parties or their respective advisors, none of the Company, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are
materially different from those forecast.

        The $90.00 per share merger consideration was determined through arm's-length negotiations between the Company and Reckitt Benckiser and was
unanimously approved by our Board. Goldman Sachs provided advice to the Company during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however,
recommend any specific amount of consideration to the Company or our Board or that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only
appropriate consideration for the merger.

        As described above, Goldman Sachs' opinion to our Board was one of many factors taken into consideration by our Board in making its determination
to adopt the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman Sachs in
connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement.

        Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment
management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees,
and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase,
sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial
instruments of the Company, Reckitt Benckiser, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in
the merger. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with, and participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the
transaction contemplated by the agreement. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company and its
affiliates from time to time. Goldman Sachs also has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Reckitt Benckiser and its affiliates
from time to time. During the two year period ended February 10, 2017, Goldman Sachs has not received any compensation for financial advisory and/or
underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to the Company, Reckitt Benckiser and/or their respective affiliates. Goldman Sachs
may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company, Reckitt Benckiser and their respective affiliates for which
the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation.

        Our Board selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because Goldman Sachs is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has
substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated January 21, 2017, the Company engaged Goldman Sachs
to act as its financial advisor in connection with the merger. The engagement letter between the Company and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction
fee that is estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $40 million, all of which is contingent upon
consummation of the merger. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse Goldman Sachs for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including
attorneys' fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various liabilities, including certain liabilities under the
federal securities laws.

        In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
information that was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to it by the Company, and formed a substantial basis for its opinion. With
respect to the Forecasts, Morgan Stanley assumed that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgment of our management of the future financial performance of the Company. In addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger would be
consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the draft merger agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions,
including, among other things, that Reckitt Benckiser would obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the draft credit facilities agreement,
and that the definitive merger agreement would not differ in any material respect from the draft that was furnished to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley
assumed that, in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the merger, no
delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions would be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be
derived in the merger. Morgan Stanley is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and relied upon, without
independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. Morgan
Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to any of our officers, directors or employees, or any
class of such persons, relative to the $90.00 per share in cash merger consideration to be received by the holders of the outstanding shares of our common
stock in the merger. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company, nor was it furnished
with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley's opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect
on, and the information made available to it, as of February 9, 2017. Events occurring after such date may affect Morgan Stanley's opinion and the
assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion.

        In arriving at its opinion, Morgan Stanley was not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any party with respect to the acquisition,
business combination or other extraordinary transaction involving the Company, nor did Morgan Stanley negotiate with any party with respect to a
possible acquisition of the Company or any of its constituent businesses.

Table of Contents

        As described in the sections entitled "—Unaudited Prospective Financial Information" beginning on page 44 and "—Background of the Merger"
beginning on page 30, the Company developed and provided certain management forecasts to Morgan Stanley in connection with its analysis of the
merger, including the Forecasts. Our Board directed Morgan Stanley to utilize the Forecasts in connection with its presentation made to our Board at its
meeting on February 9, 2017. In addition, Morgan Stanley constructed an estimate of consensus forecasts (the "Consensus Case") based on research
reports of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Berenberg, BMO Capital Markets, Citigroup, CLSA, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan
Stanley, Société Générale, Susquehanna International Group LLP, UBS, Wells Fargo and William Blair & Company. As agreed with our Board, Morgan
Stanley referred to the Forecasts and the Consensus Case in connection with its presentation made to our Board at its meeting on February 9, 2017, at
which our Board approved the merger agreement.

Historical Trading Range Analysis

        Morgan Stanley reviewed the historical unaffected trading range of our common stock for the 52-week period ended February 1, 2017, which was the
last trading day prior to public announcements by the Company and Reckitt Benckiser confirming discussions regarding a potential merger. Morgan
Stanley noted that, during such period, the six-month high intra-day price for our common stock was $89.98, the maximum intra-day price for our
common stock was $94.40 and the minimum intra-day price for our common stock was $66.66, as compared to the $90.00 per share merger consideration.

Research Price Targets

        Morgan Stanley reviewed publicly available equity research analysts' share price targets as of February 1, 2017, which was the last trading day prior
to public announcements by the Company and Reckitt Benckiser confirming discussions regarding a potential merger at $90.00 per share, on an
undiscounted basis for our common stock. Morgan Stanley noted that the price targets issued by those research analysts with publicly available price
targets ranged from $65.00 to $84.00 per share, as compared to the $90.00 per share merger consideration, but when discounted at the Company's cost of
equity of 7.8%, implied a range of $60.27 to $77.89.

        The public market trading price targets published by securities research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for our
common stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial performance of the Company and future financial market
conditions.

Selected Comparable Trading Analysis

        Morgan Stanley reviewed certain financial information, valuation multiples and market trading data relating to the Company and selected publicly
traded companies that Morgan Stanley believed, based on its experience with companies in the food and beverage industry, to be similar to the Company's
current operations for purposes of this analysis. Financial data of the selected companies were based on S&P Capital IQ's Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S
Estimates, public filings and other publicly available information. Financial data of the Company was based on the Forecasts and the Consensus Case, as
appropriate. "AV" refers to aggregate enterprise value, calculated as equity value, plus book value of total debt, plus non-controlling interest (as
appropriate for the company being analyzed), less cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. "EBITDA," as used herein, refers to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Certain of the foregoing terms are used throughout this summary of financial analyses.

        Morgan Stanley reviewed data, including AV as a multiple of the estimated calendar year 2017 EBITDA and the ratio of the price of a share of
common stock to estimated earnings (which we refer to as the P/E ratio), for the calendar year 2017 of the Company and for each of the following selected

earnings per share for calendar year 2017 contained in the Forecasts and in the Consensus Case. For calendar year 2017, estimated EBITDA and earnings
per share for the Company was $966 million and $3.21, respectively, in the Consensus Case and $996 million and $3.35, respectively, in the Forecasts.

        Based on the number of outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully-diluted basis and the Company's net debt, the analysis indicated the
following implied per share reference ranges for our common stock, in each case as compared to the $90.00 per share merger consideration:

        No company utilized in the selected comparable trading analysis is identical to the Company. In evaluating selected companies, Morgan Stanley made
judgments and assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the Company's and Morgan Stanley's control. These include, among other things, selected company growth, profitability and customer
concentration, the impact of competition on the Company's businesses and the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material
change in the Company's financial condition and prospects or the industry, or in the financial markets in general. Mathematical analysis (such as
determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using selected company data.

Discounted Equity Value Analysis

        In connection with the delivery of Morgan Stanley's fairness opinion, Morgan Stanley also performed a discounted equity value analysis, which is
designed to provide insight into a theoretical estimate of future implied value of a company's common equity as a function of such company's estimated
future earnings and a theoretical range of trading multiples. The resulting estimated future implied value is subsequently discounted back to the present
day at the company's cost of equity in order to arrive at an illustrative estimate of the present value for the company's theoretical future implied stock price.

        For this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated a theoretical future value range of implied share prices for the Company as of January 1, 2019, and
subsequently discounted such theoretical future value range including expected dividends to be received between January 1, 2017 and January 1, 2019, as
reflected in the Forecasts, to arrive at an illustrative present value range of implied share prices for the Company as of January 1, 2017. To calculate the
theoretical future implied aggregate value range, Morgan Stanley applied the Company's next twelve month ("NTM") EBITDA multiple to the NTM
EBITDA for the 2019 calendar year (which we refer to as the "NTM 2019 EBITDA Multiple"). Morgan Stanley then adjusted the theoretical future
implied aggregate value range by the Company's total debt, non-controlling interest and cash and cash equivalents based on the estimated consolidated
balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2018, while capitalized lease obligations for future periods were assumed to equal capitalized lease
obligations as of December 31, 2016, in each case, as reflected in the Forecasts. Morgan Stanley also reviewed the P/E ratio for the 2019 calendar year
(which we refer to as the "NTM 2019 EPS Ratio") for the Company, and upon the application of its professional judgment and experience, Morgan Stanley
then applied a selected range of earnings multiples to the estimates of earnings for calendar year 2019. To calculate the present value range as of January 1,
2017, Morgan Stanley applied a cost of equity of 7.8%, which was selected based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment.

consideration:

        Morgan Stanley observed that the discounted equity analysis was an illustrative analysis only and not a prediction of future trading.

Precedent Transactions Analysis

        Morgan Stanley performed a precedent transactions analysis, which is designed to imply a value of a company based on publicly available financial
terms of selected transactions that involve companies in the food and beverage and nutrition industries. Selected comparable transactions were selected

Table of Contents

        Based on the results of this analysis and its professional judgment, Morgan Stanley applied an AV/EBITDA multiple range of 15.0x to 20.0x to the
Company's 2016 EBITDA of $1.03 billion, which resulted in an implied per share reference range for our common stock of $76.73 - $104.24.

        No company or transaction utilized as a comparison in the precedent transactions analysis is identical to the Company, nor are the transactions
identical to the merger. In evaluating the transactions described above, Morgan Stanley made judgments and assumptions with regard to industry
performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, such
as the impact of competition on the business of the Company or the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in
the financial condition or property of the Company or the industry or in the financial markets in general. Accordingly, mathematical analysis, such as
determining the average or median, is not in itself a meaningful method of using comparable transaction data.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Morgan Stanley conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the purpose of determining an implied equity value per share for our common stock. A
discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using estimates of the future unlevered free cash flows generated by the asset and taking
into consideration the time value of money with respect to those future cash flows by calculating their present value. The "unlevered free cash flows" or
"free cash flows" refer to a calculation of the future cash flows of an asset without including, in such calculation, any debt servicing costs. For purposes of
the foregoing calculation, stock-based compensation is treated as a cash expense.

        Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company using information contained in the Forecasts and Consensus Case, as
appropriate, and public filings to calculate ranges of the implied value of the Company, assuming the merger closes on January 1, 2017.

        Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied values per the Company share based on the estimated future cash flows contained in the Forecasts and
Consensus Case, as appropriate, during the calendar years 2017 through 2021. Using the definition of unlevered free cash flows set forth above, Morgan
Stanley then calculated terminal values based on a terminal exit multiple of NTM EBITDA ranging from 12.0x to 15.0x. These values were then
discounted to present values, as of January 1, 2017, assuming a range of discount rates of 6.2% to 7.8%, which was selected based on Morgan Stanley's
professional judgment and by taking into consideration, among other things, a weighted average cost of capital calculation and the Company's assumed
cost of equity calculated using a capital asset pricing model. The calculation of unlevered free cash flow, as used by Morgan Stanley in its analysis, is
described in the section entitled "—Unaudited Prospective Financial Information" beginning on page 44.

        In order to calculate an implied per share equity value reference range for our common stock, Morgan Stanley then adjusted the total implied
aggregate value ranges by the Company's total debt, non-controlling interest and cash and cash equivalents based on the consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and divided the resulting implied total equity value ranges by the Company's fully diluted shares outstanding (calculated using the treasury stock
method), all as provided by our management.

        Based on the foregoing analysis, Morgan Stanley derived the following range of implied equity values per our common stock as of January 1, 2017,
in each case as compared to the $90.00 per share merger consideration:

General 

        The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily
susceptible to summary description. Morgan Stanley arrived at its opinion based on the results of all analyses undertaken and assessed as a whole, and it
did not ascribe a specific range of values to our common stock or draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to, and did not attribute any particular
weight to, any one factor or method of analysis, but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor
relative to all other analyses and factors performed and considered by it and in the context of the circumstances of the particular transaction. Accordingly,
the summary set forth above does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying the
opinion of, Morgan Stanley, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those financial
analyses by Morgan Stanley. The analyses listed in the tables and described above must be considered as a whole; considering any portion of such analyses
and of the factors considered, without also considering all analyses and factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying
Morgan Stanley's opinion. In addition, in rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley may have given various analyses and factors more or less weight than
other analyses and factors and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of implied
valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to be Morgan Stanley's view of the actual value of the Company.

        In performing its financial analyses, Morgan Stanley considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions
and other matters existing as of the date of its opinion, many of which are beyond Morgan Stanley's and the Company's control. The assumptions and
estimates contained in the financial analyses and the ranges of implied valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of
actual values or future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by such analyses. In addition, financial analyses
relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold.
Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

        The type and amount of consideration payable in the merger was determined by Reckitt Benckiser and the Company, rather than by any financial
advisor, and was approved by our Board. The decision by the Company to enter into the merger agreement was solely that of our Board. As described in
the section entitled "—Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 39, Morgan Stanley's analyses were only one of the many factors considered by our
Board in its evaluation of the merger and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of our Board or management with respect to the merger or
the $90.00 per share merger consideration.

        Morgan Stanley's opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance with its
customary practice. No limitations were imposed by our Board upon Morgan Stanley with respect to the investigations made or procedures followed by it
in rendering its opinion. Morgan Stanley did not recommend any specific amount or form of consideration to the Company or that any specific amount or
form of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.

        We retained Morgan Stanley based upon Morgan Stanley's qualifications, experience and expertise. Morgan Stanley is an internationally recognized
investment banking and advisory firm. Morgan Stanley, as part of its investment banking and financial advisory business, is continuously engaged in the
valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated

other purposes.

        As compensation for its services relating to its engagement, the Company has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a fee of approximately $24 million in the
aggregate, all of which is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. The Company may, at the sole discretion of our Board, increase the fee paid to
Morgan Stanley based on the overall services performed by Morgan Stanley. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse Morgan Stanley for its
reasonable expenses including, without limitation, professional and legal fees and disbursements, plus any sales, use or other taxes related to such fees and
disbursements, regardless of whether the merger is consummated. In addition, the Company has agreed to indemnify Morgan Stanley and its affiliates,
their respective directors, officers, agents and employees and each person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or any of its affiliates against certain
liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, related to or arising out of Morgan Stanley's engagement. Morgan
Stanley or an affiliate thereof currently is a lender to the Company. In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley's opinion, in addition to the current
engagement, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have received aggregate fees of between $1 million and $2 million for financial advisory and financing
services provided to the Company. Morgan Stanley or an affiliate thereof currently is a lender to Reckitt Benckiser and acts as administrative agent for one
of its revolving credit facilities, and also acts as joint corporate broker to Reckitt Benckiser since November 2013. In the two years prior to the date of
Morgan Stanley's opinion, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have received aggregate fees of between $4 million and $5 million for financial advisory and
financing services provided to Reckitt Benckiser. Since April 2017, Morgan Stanley has been engaged to serve as financial advisor to Reckitt Benckiser
with respect to a review by Reckitt Benckiser of strategic alternatives relating to its Food business, which is unrelated to the acquisition of the Company,
and for which Morgan Stanley would receive customary fees. Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and/or financing services to
Reckitt Benckiser and/or its affiliates on unrelated matters, subject to the terms of Morgan Stanley's engagement letter with the Company, in the future and
expects to receive fees for the rendering of any such services.

        Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth management businesses.
Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime
brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at
any time invest on a principal basis or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and
effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of the Company, Reckitt Benckiser or any
other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in the merger, or any related derivative instrument.

Debt Financing 

        Concurrently with entering into the merger agreement, Reckitt Benckiser entered into a term and revolving facilities agreement with certain financial
institutions pursuant to which Reckitt Benckiser would be provided debt financing (the "Debt Financing") on the terms and conditions set forth in the
facilities agreement, the proceeds of which, among other uses, will be used by Reckitt Benckiser to fund (i) all or a portion of the merger consideration,
(ii) the refinancing of existing indebtedness of the Company and its affiliates and (iii) the fees, costs and expenses in connection with the merger. Reckitt
Benckiser and Merger Sub are obligated to use their reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to obtain the Debt Financing at or prior to the
effective time of the merger. The merger agreement provides, however, that obtaining the Debt Financing is not a condition to Reckitt Benckiser's or
Merger Sub's obligations to close the merger.

Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        Our directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally. In
considering the recommendations of our Board, including that you vote to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware of these interests. In reaching
its decision to make such recommendations and to adopt the merger agreement, our Board was aware of these interests and considered them, along with
other matters described in the section entitled "—Reasons for the Merger" beginning on page 39. As described in more detail below, these interests
include:

• the accelerated vesting of each unvested stock option and cancellation of such stock option outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the merger in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to
such stock option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration of $90.00 per share over the exercise price per share of such stock
option; provided that each stock option with an exercise price equal to or greater than the merger consideration will be cancelled
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger without payment of any consideration; 

• the accelerated vesting and cancellation of each RSU outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, other than any RSU
granted after the date of the merger agreement (the treatment of which is described below), in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal
to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and
(ii) the merger consideration of $90.00 per share; 

• the accelerated vesting and cancellation of each PSU outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and for which the
performance period is complete as of the effective time of the merger, in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of
(i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such PSU based on actual performance for the completed performance period and
(ii) the merger consideration of $90.00 per share; 

• the accelerated vesting and cancellation of each PSU outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, and for which the
performance period is incomplete as of the effective time of the merger, in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of
(i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such PSU based on target performance for the incomplete performance period and
(ii) the merger consideration of $90.00 per share; 

• the grant of equity awards after the date of the merger agreement in connection with our annual practice of granting equity awards, but
prior to the effective time of the merger, which will, as of the effective time of the merger, convert into Converted Reckitt Benckiser RSUs
(with the cash value of each RSU for conversion purposes equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such
award and (ii) the merger consideration of $90.00 per share) subject to the same terms and conditions as the equity awards to which they
relate (including with respect to vesting); 

• the receipt of certain payments and benefits under the Third Amended and Restated Mead Johnson & Company, LLC Executive Change in
Control Severance Plan (the "Executive Change in Control Plan") in the event of certain terminations of employment that occur following
the effective time of the merger, as described in more detail in the section entitled "—Executive Change in Control Plan" beginning on
page 70; 

• entitlement to receive a tax gross-up payment to make any affected executive whole, on an after-tax basis, for any taxes imposed under
Section 4999 of the Code, notwithstanding the treatment provided in the Executive Change in Control Plan;

$90.00 per share in cash (less the applicable exercise price in the case of stock options); each outstanding unvested RSU granted after execution of the
merger agreement will be converted (with the cash value of each RSU for conversion purposes equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common
stock subject to such award and (ii) the merger consideration of $90.00 per share) into a Converted Reckitt Benckiser RSU, which is a phantom RSU
based on Reckitt Benckiser's common stock and settled in cash. The treatment of equity-based awards held by our directors and executive officers is the
same as the treatment of equity-based awards held by our employees generally.

Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers 

        For not less than six years from the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will indemnify and hold harmless the present and former
officers, employees and directors of the Company and each of its subsidiaries, in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of
the merger, against any resulting claims, losses, liabilities and reasonable fees and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, if such
officer, employee or director is or is threatened to be made a party to any actual or threatened claim. Additionally, for not less than six years from the
effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will maintain provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws which provide for
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for directors, officers and employees with respect to any matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the effective time of the merger and that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the provisions in place on the date of the
merger agreement for the Company.

        Prior to the effective time of the merger, we may purchase, and if we do not purchase then Reckitt Benckiser will cause the surviving corporation to
purchase, a six year prepaid "tail" policy of directors and officers liability insurance to cover claims related any period of time at or prior to the effective
time of the merger, with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as the coverage provided under our existing
policies in effect on the date of the merger agreement, and in each case regarding any matter existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time (and,
with respect to any claims made prior to or during such period, until final resolution of such claims). If the aggregate annual cost of such insurance
coverage exceeds 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company, the surviving corporation must instead obtain a directors' and officers' tail
policy with the best available coverage for an aggregate annual cost of 300% of the current annual premium.

Consideration Payable for Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards 

        Upon the effective time of the merger, each outstanding stock option, PSU, and RSU granted prior to execution of the merger agreement will be
converted into the right to receive the per share merger consideration (less the applicable exercise price in the case of stock options), and each outstanding
RSU granted after execution of the merger agreement will be converted into a Converted Reckitt Benckiser RSU, which is a phantom RSU based on
Reckitt Benckiser common stock and settled in cash, in each case, as described in the section entitled "—Treatment of Stock Options and Other Equity-
Based Awards" beginning on page 84. In connection with approving the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, our
Board approved the disposition of shares of common stock, stock options, RSUs and PSUs held by our directors and executive officers, so that such
dispositions in the merger and the conversion into the right to receive the merger consideration, if applicable, is exempt from liability under Section 16(b)
of the Exchange Act.

        The table below sets forth: (i) the number of outstanding unvested stock options expected to be held by our executive officers and directors as of
June 1, 2017, (ii) the number of outstanding unvested RSUs expected to be held by our executive officers and directors as of June 1, 2017, and (iii) the
number of outstanding unvested PSUs expected to be held by our executive officers and directors as of June 1, 2017, determined based on (a) actual
achievement of the performance goals applicable to PSUs for which the performance period has concluded as of June 1, 2017 and (b) target achievement
of the

performance goals applicable to PSUs for which the performance period has not concluded as of June 1, 2017. The table (x) includes the RSUs grants to
executive officers and directors made on February 28, 2017 and (y) excludes RSUs and PSUs that were previously granted to executive officers and
directors and that are expected to vest in the ordinary course before June 1, 2017, in accordance with the existing terms of the applicable award
agreements. The table set forth below does not include nor attempt to forecast any grants or additional issuances of equity-based awards following
April 24, 2017, the latest practicable date before filing of this proxy statement, nor do they forecast any dividends or forfeitures of equity-based awards
following the date of this proxy statement. Depending on when the closing date occurs, certain RSUs and PSUs shown in the table may vest prior to the
closing date in accordance with their terms.

        The table below also sets forth, for each individual, the total amount, based on the number of equity-based awards determined as described above,
payable in respect of such equity-based awards on the closing date, assuming the closing date occurs on June 1, 2017 for these purposes. The amounts are
calculated: (i) in the case of an accelerated stock option, by multiplying the number of shares of common stock subject to such stock option by the excess,
if any, of the merger consideration of $90.00 per share in cash over the exercise price per share of such stock option, and (ii) in the case of a RSU and PSU,
by multiplying the number of shares subject to such RSU or PSU by the merger consideration of $90.00 per share in cash.

        The Company's executive officers also hold vested stock options, which, provided they remain unexercised as of the effective time of the merger, will
be cancelled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the excess, if any, of the merger consideration of $90.00 per share in cash over the
exercise price per share of such stock option. However, the number and corresponding value of such vested stock options held by the Company's executive
officers are not included in the table below.

Company Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards
(As of June 1, 2017) 

Executive Change in Control Plan 

        Each of our executive officers, including our named executive officers, participates in the Executive Change in Control Plan. The Executive Change
in Control Plan provides enhanced severance and other separation benefits in the event an executive officer experiences a qualifying termination (as
defined below) in connection with the completion of a corporate transaction, such as the merger discussed herein. Treatment of outstanding equity-based
awards in the event of a qualifying termination under the Executive Change in Control Plan is governed by the terms of the applicable equity-based award
agreements.

        The Executive Change in Control Plan provides that, in the event an executive officer is terminated by the Company other than for "cause" (as
defined below) or by the executive for "good reason" (as defined below) (each, a "qualifying termination") during the two-year period following
completion of the merger, subject to the executive officer's execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of the Company and one-year non-
competition and non-solicitation restrictive

covenant obligations (as further described below), such executive officer will be paid or provided with the following severance payments and benefits:

• a lump-sum cash payment equal to three times, for Mr. Jakobsen, or two times, for each of our other executive officers, the sum of the
executive officer's (i) annual base salary and (ii) target annual bonus; 

• a lump-sum cash payment equal to a pro-rata portion of the executive officer's target bonus opportunity for the year in which the qualifying
termination occurs; 

• a lump-sum cash payment equal to the actuarial present value of the executive officer's supplemental retirement savings plan benefits under
the Company's benefit equalization plans, with the benefits calculated as if the executive officer's employment had continued with the
Company until the third anniversary of the qualifying termination date, in the case of Mr. Jakobsen, or until the second anniversary of the
qualifying termination date, in the case of each of our other executive officers, with the cash severance received under the Executive
Change in Control Plan counted as "wages" for purposes of such plans; 

• continued Company-subsidized medical, dental and life insurance coverage and participation in the employee assistance program, in each
case, until the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of the qualifying termination date, in the case of Mr. Jakobsen, or the second anniversary
of the qualifying termination date, in the case of each of our other executive officers, and (ii) the date on which the executive officer begins
new employment, with medical and dental insurance coverage subject to earlier termination to the extent required by COBRA; 

• financial planning assistance up to a maximum of $15,000 and outplacement services for up to one year (with the cost of such
outplacement services not to exceed ten percent of the executive officer's base salary as of the qualifying termination date); and 

• repatriation benefits in accordance with applicable Company policy for three months following the qualifying termination date for
executive officers who are expatriates, plus tax support for trailing liabilities in relevant countries related to overseas assignments, which is
provided pursuant to the Company's repatriation policy (with Mr. Urbain the only named executive officer currently on overseas
assignment).

        For purposes of the Executive Change in Control Plan, "good reason" means the occurrence of any of the following events without the executive
officer's express written consent: (i) assignment of any duties materially inconsistent with the executive officer's status as an officer of the Company or a
substantially adverse alteration in the nature or status of the executive officer's authorities, duties or responsibilities for the Company and its affiliates from
those in effect immediately prior to the merger; (ii) a material adverse change in the executive officer's reporting relationships; (iii) a material reduction by
the Company, the employing affiliate or any of their affiliates in the executive officer's base salary or bonus from the levels in effect immediately prior to
the merger or as the same may be increased from time to time after the merger; (iv) the relocation of the executive officer's principal place of employment
to a location more than 50 miles from the location of such place of employment immediately prior to the merger, except for required travel on the
Company's business to an extent substantially consistent with the executive officer's business travel obligations prior to the merger or, if the executive has
consented to a relocation, the failure by the Company to provide the executive officer with all of the benefits of the relocation policy of the Company or its
affiliates, as applicable, as in operation immediately prior to the merger; (v) the failure of the Company, the employing affiliate or any of their affiliates to
pay the executive officer any material amount or portion of the executive officer's compensation or to pay to the executive officer any portion of an
installment of deferred compensation under any deferred compensation program of the Company or its affiliates within seven days of the date on which
such compensation was due; or (vi) the failure of the Company, the

employing affiliate or any of their affiliates to continue in effect any compensation or benefit plan which is material to the executive officer's compensation
and in which the executive officer participated immediately prior to the merger, unless an equitable arrangement has been made with respect to such plan,
or the failure by the Company, the employing affiliate or any of their respective affiliates, as applicable, to continue the executive officer's participation
therein on a basis not materially less favorable, both in terms of the amounts of benefits provided and the level of executive officer's participation relative
to other participants, as existed at the time of the merger. The Company believes that the completion of the merger will constitute "good reason" to
terminate employment for each of Messrs. Jakobsen, Cup, Sheller and Ormesher, due to the adverse change in each such executive officer's duties
resulting from the Company becoming a subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser. The Company may enter into a letter agreement with each of these executive
officers that provides that the completion of the merger will constitute "good reason" (or term or concept of similar import) under the terms of any
Company benefit plans in which such executive officer participates, including under the Executive Change in Control Plan. Pursuant to these letter
agreements, such executive officers will have the right to terminate their employment and receive the payments and benefits provided under the applicable
Company benefit plans, including the Executive Change in Control Plan, in connection with a termination of employment for "good reason"; provided that
each such executive officer agrees to remain an employee of the Company until the 30-day anniversary, in the case of Mr. Jakobsen, or the 90-day
anniversary, in the case of each of Messrs. Cup, Sheller and Ormesher, of the effective time of the merger.

        For purposes of the Executive Change in Control Plan, "cause" means the executive officer's: (i) willful and continued failure to substantially perform
his or her duties with the Company, the employing affiliate or any of their affiliates (except where the failure results from incapacity due to disability) for a
period of 30 consecutive days after written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the executive officer, which demand specifically identifies
the manner in which our Board believes the executive officer has not substantially performed his or her duties; (ii) willful engagement in conduct that is
demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates, monetarily or otherwise; or (iii) felony conviction, or entry of plea of
nolo contendere to, a felony. For purposes of clauses (i) and (ii), no act, or failure to act, on the executive officer's part will be deemed "willful" unless
done, or omitted to be done, by the executive officer not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the executive officer's act, or failure to act, was in
the best interest of the Company and its affiliates.

        Payments under the Executive Change in Control Plan are subject to non-competition and non-solicitation restrictive covenant obligations for a
period of one year following the executive officer's termination of employment, which restrict the executive officer from (i) directly or indirectly accepting
any employment, consulting for or with, or otherwise providing or performing any services of any nature to, for or on behalf of anyone in the business of
manufacturing, distributing, selling or marketing infant formula, children's nutrition or any other product which the Company manufactures, distributes,
sells or markets at the time of the executive officer's termination of employment (a "Product"), including but not limited to Abbott Laboratories, Danone,
Heinz, Nestle S.A., Pfizer, and their affiliates; (ii) directly or indirectly permitting any business, entity or organization which the executive officer,
individually or jointly with others, owns, manages, operates, or controls, to engage in the manufacture, production, distribution, sale or marketing of any of
the Products in the territory, region or country where the Company sells any Products at any time during the one year period following the executive
officer's termination of employment; or (iii) directly or indirectly employing or soliciting the employment of (whether as an employee, officer, director,
agent, consultant or independent contractor) any person who is or was an officer, director, representative, agent or employee of the Company at any time
during the one year period prior to the executive officer's last day of employment.

Table of Contents

        For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would become payable under the Executive Change in Control Plan to
the Company's named executive officers, see the subsection entitled "—Potential Change in Control Payments to Named Executive Officers" below. The
aggregate value of the payments and benefits that would become payable to the Company's other executive officers, assuming that the effective time of the
merger is June 1, 2017 and that each of our other executive officers experiences a qualifying termination on such date, is $5,367,441. This estimate is
based on compensation and benefit levels that will be in effect as of June 1, 2017; therefore, if compensation and benefit levels are changed after such date,
the actual value of the severance payments and benefits payable to the Company's other executive officers may be different from those set forth in this
proxy statement.

Section 4999 Excise Tax 

        Certain of our executive officers may be subject to excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. In contemplation of the merger and notwithstanding
the treatment provided in the Executive Change in Control Plan, our Board has decided to provide each affected executive officer with a gross-up payment
to make such executive officer whole, on an after-tax basis, for any excise taxes imposed on such executive officer under Section 4999 of the Code (such
payment, the "Section 4999 Gross-Up").

        For estimated values of the Section 4999 Gross-Ups payable to our named executive officers, see the subsection entitled "—Potential Change in
Control Payments to Named Executive Officers" below. The aggregate value of the Section 4999 Gross-Ups that would become payable to the Company's
other executive officers, assuming that the effective time of the merger is June 1, 2017 and that each of our other executive officers experiences a
qualifying termination on such date, is $623,866. This estimate is based on compensation and benefit levels that will be in effect on June 1, 2017; and
takes into account a reasonable estimation of the value associated with the executive's post-termination non-competition and non-solicitation covenants, as
further described above in the subsection entitled "—Executive Change in Control Plan"; therefore, if compensation and benefit levels are changed after
such date, the actual values of the Section 4999 Gross-Ups payable to our other executive officers may be different from those set forth in this proxy
statement.

Potential Change in Control Payments to Named Executive Officers 

        The table below, entitled "Potential Change-in-Control Payments to Named Executive Officers," along with its footnotes, sets forth the information
required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K regarding the compensation payable to our named executive officers, which compensation is subject to a non-
binding, advisory vote of our stockholders, as described below in the section entitled "Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Compensation Proposal" on
page 102. The table assumes that the completion of the merger occurs on June 1, 2017 and that each named executive officer incurs a qualifying
termination on such date. The value of any equity-based awards was calculated by multiplying (i) the number of the named executive officer's outstanding
unvested stock options by the excess, if any, of the merger consideration of $90.00 per share in cash over the exercise price per share of such stock option,
and (ii) the number of shares of common stock subject to the named executive officer's RSUs and PSUs by the merger consideration of $90.00 per share in
cash.

        The calculations in the table below do not include amounts the named executive officers were already entitled to receive or amounts in which the
named executive officers were vested, in each case, as of the date hereof, nor amounts under contracts, agreements, plans or arrangements to the extent
they do not discriminate in scope, terms or operation in favor of executive officers and that are available generally to all the salaried employees of the
Company.

(1) Cash Severance. As described above in the subsection entitled "—Executive Change in Control Plan" beginning on page 70, the
lump-sum cash severance payments payable to each of Messrs. Jakobsen, Cup, Urbain, Sheller and Ormesher consist of (a) two
times (three times, in the case of Mr. Jakobsen) the sum of the named executive officer's (i) base salary in effect immediately prior
to the date of the qualifying termination and (ii) target annual cash bonus payable in respect of the year in which the qualifying
termination occurs; and (b) a pro-rata portion of the named executive officer's target annual cash bonus for the year in which the
qualifying termination occurs. 

The cash severance payments described in the preceding paragraph are "double-trigger" in nature, as they only will be payable in
the event of a named executive officer's qualifying termination during the two-year period following the completion of the merger,
as described above. The amounts shown in this column are based on the named executive officers' compensation and benefit levels
that will be in effect on June 1, 2017, the assumed date of the completion of the merger for purposes of this proxy statement;
therefore, if compensation and benefit levels are changed after such date, actual payments to the named executive officers may be
different from those provided above. The cash severance payments are subject to the executive officer's execution and non-
revocation of a release of claims in favor of the Company and one-year non-competition and non-solicitation restrictive covenant
obligations (collectively, the "Change in Control Plan Payment Obligations").

(2) Equity. As described above in the section entitled "—Treatment of Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards" on page 84, the
equity amounts consist of the accelerated vesting and payment of outstanding and unvested stock options, RSUs and PSUs, with the
value of the PSUs determined based on (a) actual achievement of the performance goals applicable to PSUs for which the
performance period has concluded as of June 1, 2017 and (b) target achievement of the performance goals applicable to PSUs for
which the performance period has not concluded as of June 1, 2017. The amounts shown are based on the number of such equity-
based awards that will be held by each named executive officer as of June 1, 2017, the assumed date of the completion of

the merger for purposes of this proxy statement. The amounts shown do not attempt to forecast any grants, additional issuances,
dividends, additional deferrals or forfeitures of equity-based awards following the date of this proxy statement. Depending on when
the closing date occurs, certain equity-based awards may have vested prior to the closing date in accordance with their terms.

The equity payments described in the preceding paragraph generally are "single-trigger" in nature, as they will become payable
immediately upon the completion of the merger, whether or not the named executive officer's employment is terminated in
connection with the merger, with the exception of the payment attributable to the accelerated vesting of any Converted Reckitt
Benckiser RSUs, as such accelerated payment is "double-trigger" in nature, as it will be made only in the event of a named
executive officer's qualifying termination or termination due to death or disability, in each case, following the effective time of the
merger.

Ian E. Ormesher  $ 550,585 $ 475,200 $ 987,570 $ 557,190 $ 2,570,545 

(3) Supplemental Retirement Benefits. As described above in the subsection entitled "—Executive Change in Control Plan" beginning
on page 70, the supplemental retirement benefits to the named executive officers consist of a lump-sum cash payment equal to the
actuarial present value of the named executive officer's supplemental retirement savings plan benefits under the Company's benefit
equalization plans, with the benefits calculated as if the named executive officer's employment had continued with the company
until the third anniversary of the qualifying termination date, in the case of Mr. Jakobsen, or until the second anniversary of the
qualifying termination date, in the case of each of our other named executive officers, with the cash severance received under the
Executive Change in Control Plan counted as "wages" for purposes of such plans. 

The supplemental retirement benefit payment described in the preceding paragraph is considered "double-trigger" in nature, as it
will be made only in the event of a named executive officer's qualifying termination following the effective time of the merger. The
amounts shown in this column are based on the compensation and benefit levels that will be in effect on June 1, 2017, the assumed
date of the completion of the merger for purposes of this proxy statement; therefore, if compensation and benefit levels are changed
after such date, actual payments to the named executive officers may be different from those provided above. The supplemental
retirement benefits are subject to the executive officer's Change in Control Plan Payment Obligations.

(4) Health and Welfare Benefits. As described above in the subsection entitled "—Executive Change in Control Plan" beginning on
page 70, the health and welfare benefits to the named executive officers consist of continued Company-subsidized medical, dental
and life insurance coverage and participation in the employee assistance program, in each case, until the earlier of (a) the third
anniversary of the qualifying termination date, in the case of Mr. Jakobsen, or the second anniversary of the qualifying termination
date, in the case of each of our other named executive officers, and (b) the date on which the named executive officer begins new
employment, with

medical and dental insurance coverage subject to earlier termination to the extent required by COBRA.

The health and welfare benefits described in the preceding paragraph are considered "double-trigger" in nature, as they will only be
provided in the event of a named executive officer's qualifying termination following the completion of the merger. The amounts
reflected in the column above reflect health and welfare benefit rates in effect for 2017; therefore, if benefit level rates change
between the date of this proxy statement and the closing of the merger, actual benefits provided to the named executive officers
may be different from those provided above. The continuation of health and welfare benefits (other than COBRA continuation
coverage) is subject to the executive officer's Change in Control Plan Payment Obligations.

(5) Tax Gross-Up Payments. (a) As described above in the subsection entitled "—Executive Change in Control Plan" beginning on
page 70, pursuant to the Company's repatriation policy, executive officers who are expatriates (only Mr. Urbain at this time) are
entitled to tax support for trailing liabilities in relevant countries related to overseas assignments. The tax support is "single-trigger"
in nature, as it will become payable immediately upon the completion of the merger, whether or not the named executive officer's
employment is terminated in connection with the merger. Mr. Urbain is entitled to this benefit regardless of whether the merger is
consummated. However, the amount of the tax support may be increased as a result of the payments and benefits provided to the
named executive officer in connection with a qualifying termination under the Executive Change in Control Plan. Due to the nature
of the tax support benefit provided to Mr. Urbain, we are unable to calculate the approximate value associated with this benefit at
this time. 

(b) As described above in the subsection entitled "—Section 4999 Excise Tax" on page 73, the Section 4999 Gross-Up is equal to an
amount sufficient to make the named executive officer whole, on an after-tax basis, for any excise taxes imposed on such named
executive officer under Section 4999 of the Code. The Section 4999 Gross-Up is "double-trigger" in nature, as it will be payable
only in the event of a named executive officer's qualifying termination following the completion of the merger. The amounts shown
in this column are based on the compensation and benefit levels that will be in effect on June 1, 2017, the assumed date of the
completion of the merger for purposes of this proxy statement, and takes into account a reasonable estimation of the value
associated with the executive's post-termination non-competition and non-solicitation covenants, as described above in the
subsection entitled "—Executive Change in Control Plan" beginning on page 70; therefore, if compensation and benefit levels are
changed after such date, actual payments to the named executive officers may be different from those provided above.

(6) Other. As described above in the subsection entitled "—Executive Change in Control Plan" beginning on page 70, upon a
qualifying termination, the named executive officers are entitled to (a) financial planning assistance up to a maximum of $15,000
and (b) outplacement services for up to one year (with the cost of such outplacement services not to exceed ten percent of the
named executive officer's base salary as of the qualifying termination date). 

The financial planning and outplacement benefits described in the preceding paragraph are considered "double-trigger" in nature, as
they will only be payable in the event of a named executive officer's qualifying termination following the completion of the merger.

(7) Total. The amounts in this column represent the total of all compensation and benefits provided in columns (1) through (6). 

The "single-trigger" and "double-trigger" components of the aggregate total compensation amounts, respectively, for each named
executive officer are set forth below. The double trigger benefits are payable upon a termination by the Company without cause or
by the executive for good reason within two years following the merger, subject to the executive officer's execution and

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences 

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger 

        The following discussion is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger that are relevant to holders of shares of our
common stock whose shares are converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the merger. This discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury
Regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the IRS, and other
applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with
retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their shares of our common stock as "capital assets" within the meaning of Section 1221
of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This summary does not describe any of the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state,
local or foreign tax jurisdiction and does not consider any aspects of U.S. federal tax law other than income taxation (e.g., estate, gift or alternative
minimum tax or the Medicare net investment income surtax). In addition, this summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to
holders of shares who exercise appraisal rights under Delaware law. For purposes of this discussion, a "holder" means either a U.S. Holder or a Non-U.S.
Holder (each as defined below) or both, as the context may require.

        This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their
particular circumstances, including:

• Holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, such as: financial institutions, tax-exempt
organizations, S corporations or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, insurance companies, mutual funds, dealers in stocks and securities, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market
method of accounting for their securities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, or certain expatriates or former
long-term residents of the United States; 

• Holders holding the shares as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle or other risk reducing transaction; 

• Holders that received their shares of our common stock in a compensatory transaction pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or
otherwise; or 

• U.S. Holders whose "functional currency" is not the U.S. dollar.

77

non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of the Company and observance of one-year non-competition and non-solicitation
restrictive covenant obligations. It is expected that the Company will acknowledge that Messrs. Jakobsen, Cup, Sheller and
Ormesher will have good reason as a result of the merger and, assuming that these executives terminate their employment following
the merger, they will be entitled to both the single- and double-trigger benefits below.

Table of Contents

        If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of shares of
our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the
partnership. Partnerships holding the shares of our common stock and partners therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the consequences of the
merger.

        THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE TO
ANY STOCKHOLDER. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN LIGHT OF YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES
ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAXING JURISDICTION.

U.S. Holders

        For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock who or that is for U.S. federal income tax
purposes:

• An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 

• A corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or
the District of Columbia; 

• An estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

• A trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons, as defined in
section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under
applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the merger will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder's gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received by such U.S.
Holder and the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the merger. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of our common
stock at different times or at different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine gain or loss separately for each block of shares exchanged for cash pursuant
to the merger. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss generally will
be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder's holding period in such shares is more than one year at the time of the
completion of the merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder. There are
limitations on the deductibility of capital losses.

Non-U.S. Holders

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "Non-U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock who or that is neither a U.S.
Holder nor a partnership (or an entity taxable as a partnership) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

        Special rules not discussed below may apply to certain Non-U.S. Holders subject to special tax treatment such as "controlled foreign corporations" or
"passive foreign investment companies." Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax
consequences that may be relevant to them in light of their particular circumstances.

Table of Contents

        Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

• The gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States, or in the case of
an individual, a fixed base in the United States maintained by such non-U.S. Holder), in which case such gain generally will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be
subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty); or 

• Such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the merger, and
certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or
a lower rate under an applicable tax treaty), but may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder (even though the
individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided that the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax
returns with respect to such losses.

Backup Withholding

        Payments due to U.S. Holders, other than U.S. Holders who are exempt recipients (such as corporations), pursuant to the merger may be subject to
federal "backup withholding" (currently at a rate of 28%) unless certain requirements are satisfied. In order to avoid backup withholding with respect to
cash received pursuant to the merger, a non-corporate U.S. Holder should provide an accurate taxpayer identification number (generally on an IRS
Form W-9). Non-U.S. Holders are generally exempt from backup withholding and should furnish the required certification as to their non-U.S. status, such
as by providing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN (or W-8BEN-E) or IRS Form W-8ECI, or otherwise establish an exemption. Non-corporate U.S. Holders who
fail to provide their correct taxpayer identification numbers may be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS. Amounts withheld, if any, under the backup
withholding rules are not an additional tax and may be refunded or credited against the holder's federal income tax liability, provided that the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Delisting and Deregistration of Our Common Stock 

        If the merger is completed, our common stock will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we
will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC on account of our common stock.

        If our stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement or if the merger is not completed for any other reason, our stockholders will not receive any
payment for their shares in connection with the merger. Instead, we will remain an independent public company and our common stock will continue to be
listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange, so long as we continue to meet the applicable listing requirements.

Reckitt Benckiser Stockholder Approval 

        In order to complete the merger, Reckitt Benckiser must obtain the affirmative vote of a majority of Reckitt Benckiser's stockholders present, in
person or by proxy, at the Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting approving the merger. The Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting is scheduled to be held
on May 31, 2017, subject to adjournment or postponement in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

Table of Contents

Governmental and Regulatory Approvals 

        Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Company and Reckitt Benckiser cannot complete the merger until they notify and
furnish information to the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, and specified waiting period
requirements are satisfied. The Company and Reckitt Benckiser filed the notification and report forms under the HSR Act with the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission and the Antitrust Division on February 27, 2017 and received the termination of the waiting period effective as of March 24, 2017.

        The Company and Reckitt Benckiser must also file for and receive certain non-U.S. regulatory approvals prior to completing the merger. The
Company and Reckitt Benckiser have made all relevant filings prior to March 10, 2017. As of the date hereof, the Company and Reckitt Benckiser have
received a majority of the non-U.S. regulatory approvals.

Legal Proceedings 

        On February 14, 2017, a stockholder of the Company filed a purported stockholder class action lawsuit in Cook County, Illinois, captioned Kirkham v.
Altschuler, et al., 2017-CH-02109. The defendants are the Company, the individual members of our Board, Reckitt Benckiser and Merger Sub. The lawsuit
alleges that the members of our Board violated their fiduciary duties and that the Company, Reckitt Benckiser and Merger Sub aided and abetted such
breaches, in each case in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, to enjoin
consummation of the merger. On March 28, 2017, the plaintiff stockholder filed an amended complaint. In addition to the allegations of the original
complaint, the amended complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to disclose certain information in the preliminary proxy statement, filed with
the SEC on March 13, 2017. The plaintiff alleges that this omitted information is material for stockholders to vote on the Merger. The amended complaint
alleges the same causes of actions against the same defendants and seeks the same relief as did the original complaint. The Company and its directors
intend to vigorously defend against the allegations in the complaint.

        On March 21, 2017, a stockholder of the Company filed a purported stockholder class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware, captioned Steinberg v. Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, et al., 1:17-cv-00304. The defendants are the Company, the individual
members of our Board, Reckitt Benckiser and Merger Sub. The lawsuit alleges that the Company's preliminary proxy statement, filed with the SEC on
March 13, 2017, is false and misleading with respect to the merger and thus the Company and the individual defendants violated Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act as well as SEC Rule 14a-9 and Reckitt Benckiser and the individual defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The lawsuit
seeks, among other things, to enjoin consummation of the merger. The Company and its directors intend to vigorously defend against the allegations in the
complaint.

        On March 27, 2017, a stockholder of the Company filed a purported stockholder class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware, captioned Rubin v. Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, et al., 1:17-cv-00325. The defendants are the Company, the individual
members of our Board, Reckitt Benckiser and Merger Sub. The lawsuit alleges that the Company's preliminary proxy statement, filed with the SEC on
March 13, 2017, is false and misleading with respect to the merger and thus all defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act as well as SEC
Rule 14a-9 and the individual defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, to enjoin consummation of
the merger. The Company and its directors intend to vigorously defend against the allegations in the complaint.

members of our Board, Reckitt Benckiser and Merger Sub. The lawsuit alleges that the Company's preliminary proxy statement, filed with the SEC on
March 13, 2017, is false and misleading with respect to the merger and thus the Company and the individual defendants violated Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act as well as SEC Rule 14a-9 and all defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, to enjoin
consummation of the merger. The Company and its directors intend to vigorously defend against the allegations in the complaint.

        On March 30, 2017, a stockholder of the Company filed a purported stockholder class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware, captioned Walters v. Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, et al., 1:17-cv-00344. The defendants are the Company and the individual
members of our Board. The lawsuit alleges that the Company's preliminary proxy statement, filed with the SEC on March 13, 2017, is false and
misleading with respect to the merger and thus all defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the individual defendants violated
Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The lawsuit seeks, among other things, to enjoin consummation of the merger. The Company and its directors intend to
vigorously defend against the allegations in the complaint.

Anticipated Closing of the Merger 

        We intend to complete the closing of the merger promptly after all of the conditions to consummation of the merger are satisfied or waived, including
the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders and the absence of any legal prohibitions to the merger. We currently expect the merger to be
completed in the third calendar quarter of 2017, although we cannot assure completion by any particular date, if at all. We will issue a press release and
letters of transmittal for your use once the merger has been completed.

        At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of our common stock (other than (x) shares held by the Company as treasury stock (other
than shares held for the account of clients, customers or other persons), (y) held by Reckitt Benckiser or by any subsidiary of either the Company or
Reckitt Benckiser and (z) held by a stockholder who perfects appraisal rights in accordance with Delaware law will automatically be converted into the
right to receive $90.00 in cash, without interest and less any required tax withholding (the "merger consideration"). The price of $90.00 per share was
determined through arm's-length negotiations between us and Reckitt Benckiser. No shares of our common stock outstanding prior to the effective time of
the merger (other than excluded shares) will remain outstanding after the effective time of the merger and all such shares will automatically be cancelled
and will cease to exist at the effective time of the merger. Shares held by stockholders who have properly made and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal
rights under Delaware law (which we refer to as "dissenting shares") will not be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration unless and
until such holder has effectively withdrawn, failed to perfect or otherwise lost such holder's rights to appraisal or payment under Delaware law, at which
time such shares will be treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the effective time, the merger
consideration, without interest and less any required tax withholding. The Company will give Reckitt Benckiser prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of shares and Reckitt Benckiser will have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to all such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Reckitt Benckiser, the Company will not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands. Each of
the exchange agent, the Company, the surviving corporation and Reckitt Benckiser, any of their respective affiliates, will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration or any payment otherwise payable to any person pursuant to the merger agreement such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of applicable law. Any such withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of the merger agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of whom the exchange agent, the Company, the surviving corporation or
Reckitt Benckiser, or such affiliates, as the case may be, made such deduction and withholding. See the section entitled "The Merger—Material U.S.
Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger" beginning on page 77 and consult your tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of the merger to you in your particular circumstances, as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

Closing; Effective Time of the Merger 

        The closing of the merger will occur as soon as possible, but in any event, no later than three (3) business days after all of the closing conditions have
been met or waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit thereof. The merger will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of merger with
the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later date or time as is agreed upon by Reckitt Benckiser and the Company and specified in the certificate of
merger. The filing of the certificate of merger will occur at the closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger

agreement and in accordance with Delaware law, at the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser
and a party to the merger agreement, will merge with and into the Company and the Company will survive the merger as a wholly-owned indirect
subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser.

Procedures for Exchange of Certificates 

        Prior to the effective time of the merger, Reckitt Benckiser or a subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser will appoint an agent to act as exchange agent under
the merger agreement, and Reckitt Benckiser will make available, or cause to be made available, the merger consideration to the exchange agent for
payment to the Company stockholders. The merger agreement provides that promptly after the effective time of the merger, Reckitt Benckiser will send or
cause the exchange agent to send to each holder of shares of our common stock at the effective time a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in such
exchange. Each holder of shares of our common stock that have been converted into the right to receive the merger consideration will be entitled to
receive, (i) in the case of certificates that immediately prior to the effective time represented outstanding shares of our common stock, upon surrender to
the exchange agent of a certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal and (ii) in the case of shares held in book-entry form, upon
receipt of any "agent's message" by the exchange agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the exchange agent may reasonably request), the
merger consideration in respect of the shares of our common stock represented by such certificate or such book-entry shares, as applicable. Until so
surrendered or transferred, each such certificate or share held in book-entry form will represent for all purposes after the effective time only the right to
receive such merger consideration as provided in the merger agreement.

        If any portion of the merger consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate or the transferred
book-entry share is registered, payment may be made with respect to such shares to such person if (i) such certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer or such shares held in book-entry form have been properly transferred and (ii) the person requesting such payment pays to the
exchange agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a person other than the registered holder of such certificate or shares
held in book-entry form, the shares are presented to the exchange agent, properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the transferee
either pays to the exchange agent any applicable transfer taxes relating to such transfer, or establishes that such transfer taxes have been paid or are not
applicable.

        If your stock certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the exchange agent will deliver to you the applicable merger consideration for the shares
represented by that certificate if you make an affidavit claiming such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed with such assurances as Reckitt
Benckiser or the exchange agent may require, including, if required by the surviving corporation, the posting of a bond.

        You should not send your certificates until requested to do so and should send them only pursuant to instructions set forth in the letters of
transmittal to be mailed to stockholders promptly after the effective time of the merger. In all cases, the merger consideration will be paid only in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the merger agreement and such letters of transmittal.

        The merger agreement provides that one year after the effective time of the merger, the exchange agent will deliver to Reckitt Benckiser (or a
subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser that appointed the exchange agent, if any) any funds made available to the exchange agent which have not been disbursed
to holders of our common stock, and that any holders of shares who have not complied with the above-described procedures to receive payment of the
merger consideration during such one year period may thereafter look only to Reckitt Benckiser (or such subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser) for payment of
the

merger consideration, without interest, to which they are entitled. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of our common stock
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental authority will become, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, the property of Reckitt Benckiser or such subsidiary, as applicable. Any portion of the merger consideration made available to
the exchange agent to pay for shares of our common stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected will be returned to, or as directed by, Reckitt
Benckiser (or a subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser that appointed the exchange agent, if any).

Treatment of Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards 

        Stock Options.    At the effective time of the merger, each stock option that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger,
whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock
for which such stock option has not been exercised and (ii) the excess, if any, of the merger consideration of $90.00 per share over the exercise price per
share of such stock option. Each stock option with an exercise price equal to or greater than the merger consideration will be cancelled immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger without payment of any consideration.

        Restricted Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each RSU that was outstanding as of the date of the merger agreement (see "2017 Equity
Awards" below for treatment of RSUs granted after the date of the merger agreement) and remains outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the merger will vest and be cancelled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject
to such RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and (ii) the merger consideration of $90.00 per share.

        Performance Stock Units.    At the effective time of the merger, each PSU that remains outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
merger will vest and be cancelled in exchange for a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to
such PSU (the "PSU Amount") and (ii) the merger consideration of $90.00 per share. The PSU Amount equals the sum of (x) the number of shares of
common stock underlying such award based on actual performance for any completed one-year performance period ending prior to the effective time of
the merger, and (y) the number of shares of common stock underlying such award based on target performance for any one-year performance period that
has not been completed as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger.

        2017 Equity Awards.    The Company may grant equity awards after the date of the merger agreement, but prior to the effective time of the merger, in
connection with its annual practice of granting equity awards and as otherwise permitted by the merger agreement, and such awards shall consist solely of
RSUs. Each RSU that is granted after the date of the merger agreement and that remains outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
will, as of the effective time of the merger, convert into a phantom RSU award tied to shares of Reckitt Benckiser's common stock (with the cash value of
each RSU for conversion purposes equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of common stock subject to such award and (ii) the merger
consideration of $90.00 per share) that will be settled in cash upon satisfaction of the applicable vesting conditions (such converted awards, the "Converted
Reckitt Benckiser RSUs"). Each Converted Reckitt Benckiser RSU will remain subject to the same terms and conditions as the RSU to which it relates
(including vesting).

Representations and Warranties 

        The merger agreement contains representations and warranties of the Company and Reckitt Benckiser. The representations and warranties in the
merger agreement are complicated and not easily summarized. You are urged to read carefully, and in their entirety, the sections of the merger agreement

assertions embodied in the representations and warranties, except for those related to (i) corporate existence and power, (ii) corporate authorization,
(iii) capitalization and (iv) the opinions of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, made by us are qualified by information and statements disclosed in
certain documents filed by the Company with the SEC after January 1, 2014 and as made in a confidential disclosure schedule to the merger agreement
(the "disclosure schedule") that we provided to Reckitt Benckiser in connection with the signing of the merger agreement. While we do not believe that
such disclosure schedule contains information that applicable securities laws require us to disclose publicly (other than information that has already been
so disclosed), the disclosure schedule does contain information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties set
forth in the merger agreement. Accordingly, you should not rely on the representations and warranties in the merger agreement as characterizations of the
actual state of facts, since such representations and warranties were made by the parties to the merger agreement to and solely for the benefit of each other,
and they are modified in important part by the underlying disclosure schedule. The disclosure schedule contains information that has been included in our
general prior public disclosures, as well as additional non-public information. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations
and warranties may have changed since the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in our public
disclosures.

        The merger agreement contains representations and warranties of the Company as to, among other things:

• corporate existence and power; 

• corporate authorization; 

• governmental authorization; 

• non-contravention; 

• capitalization; 

• subsidiaries; 

• SEC filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;

Conduct of Business Pending Closing 

        We have agreed in the merger agreement that, except (i) with the prior written consent of Reckitt Benckiser (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), (ii) for certain actions contemplated by the merger agreement or set forth in the disclosure schedule, or (iii) as required
by law, between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time, the Company will and will cause its subsidiaries to conduct its business in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice and, to the extent consistent with the foregoing, to use its reasonable best efforts to: (A) preserve intact its
present business organization, (B) keep available the services of its directors, officers and key employees, and (C) maintain existing relationships with its
customers, suppliers, distributors and others having material business relationships with it. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except for
matters set forth in the applicable section of the disclosure schedule, as specifically provided by the merger agreement or, with the prior written consent of
Reckitt Benckiser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), from the date of the merger agreement until the effective
time or the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries may:

• amend organizational documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; 

• split, combine or reclassify any shares of capital stock of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; pay any dividend or other distribution in
respect of capital stock of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, except for the Company's regular quarterly dividend of up to $0.4125 per

No Solicitation of an Acquisition Proposal; Company Adverse Recommendation Change 

        We have agreed in the merger agreement, between the date of the merger agreement and the effective time, to certain limitations on our ability to take
action with respect to alternative acquisition transactions. Except as set forth below, we have agreed to not, and to cause our subsidiaries and our, its and
our respective affiliates' directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other representatives retained in connection with the
merger not to, and to use reasonable best efforts to cause certain other representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any "Acquisition Proposal" (as defined below); 

• enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations relating to an Acquisition Proposal with, furnish any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or

• amend or grant any waiver or release under or fail to enforce any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, unless our Board determines after considering advice from outside legal counsel to the
Company that the failure to waive or release such provision could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Delaware law; 

• (i) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Reckitt Benckiser, or publicly propose to fail to make, withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Reckitt Benckiser, a recommendation by our Board to our stockholders to adopt the merger agreement (the "Company
Board Recommendation"), (ii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in this proxy statement or (iii) recommend, adopt or

Recommendation Change"); 

• approve any person becoming an "interested stockholder" under Section 203 of the DGCL; or 

• enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement).

        Notwithstanding these limitations, the merger agreement provides that, at any time prior to obtaining the requisite stockholder approval of the merger
with Reckitt Benckiser:

• if we or any of our representatives receive a written Acquisition Proposal from any third party, which Acquisition Proposal did not result
from a breach of the non-solicit provision of the merger agreement, we may directly or indirectly through our representatives, contact such
third party for the sole purpose of clarifying the terms and conditions thereof and if our Board determines in good faith, after considering
advice from a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and our outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to result in a "Superior Proposal" (as defined below), then the Company, directly or indirectly through its
representatives, may (i) furnish information (including non-public information) relating to the Company to such third party pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with such third party with terms no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those provided in the
confidentiality agreement with Reckitt Benckiser, except that such confidentiality agreement with such third party (A) does not need to
include a standstill provision or prohibit the submission of Acquisition Proposals or amendments thereto to the Company, and (B) will not
in any event include provisions requiring exclusive negotiations, a copy of which confidentiality agreement with such third party will be
provided to Reckitt Benckiser promptly after the execution thereof; provided that, to the extent that any such information furnished to such
third party has not been previously provided or made available to Reckitt Benckiser or its Representatives, all such information will be
promptly provided or made available to Reckitt Benckiser and (ii) enter into, engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with the third party making such Acquisition Proposal; 

• following receipt of a Superior Proposal after the date of the merger agreement, our Board may (i) make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (ii) terminate the merger agreement pursuant to and in accordance with the merger agreement in order to enter
into a definitive, written agreement concerning a Superior Proposal; and 

• other than in connection with a Superior Proposal, our Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, our Board cannot take any of the actions set forth in the above three bullet points unless our Board

to take such action would (or, in the case of the first bullet point, could) reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware
law, provided, that unless and until the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the merger agreement and the merger will be
submitted to our stockholders at the Company stockholder meeting notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change. In addition, we are
required to notify Reckitt Benckiser promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, any bona fide written
indication that a third party intends to make an Acquisition Proposal or any written request for information relating to the Company or any of our
subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of our subsidiaries by any third party that intends to
make an Acquisition Proposal. The merger agreement requires that we identify the third party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. We are also obligated to keep Reckitt Benckiser reasonably informed on a current basis of any material
developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, and are required to promptly (and in no event
later than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Reckitt Benckiser copies of all correspondence and written materials that describes any terms or conditions of
any Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries of any material oral communications addressing such matters).

        Our Board is prohibited from making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition Proposal or terminating the merger
agreement to accept a Superior Proposal unless (i) we have promptly notified Reckitt Benckiser in writing at least four business days before taking that
action, of our intention to do so, attaching in the case of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change to be made following receipt of a Superior
Proposal, the most current version of the proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the
third party making the Acquisition Proposal, or in the case of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, a reasonably detailed description of the facts
relating to such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, and (ii) during such four business day period, if requested by Reckitt Benckiser, the
Company and its representatives have discussed and negotiated in good faith (in each case to the extent Reckitt Benckiser desires to negotiate) with
Reckitt Benckiser and its representatives regarding any proposal by Reckitt Benckiser to amend the terms of the merger agreement in response to such
Superior Proposal or potential Company Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable and (iii) after such four business day period, our Board has
determined in good faith, after considering advice from a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation (in the case of a Superior Proposal) and
outside legal counsel, and taking into account any proposal by Reckitt Benckiser to amend the terms of the merger agreement made during such period,
that (A) such Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal or (B) the failure to take such action would continue to reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware law. Any amendment to the financial or other material terms of any such Superior Proposal will
require a new written notification from the Company and a new notice period, except that such negotiation period will only be for three business days.

        Under the merger agreement, an "Acquisition Proposal" means, other than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, any offer or
proposal by a third party relating to (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries or 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, (ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and
its subsidiaries or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar

transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated
assets of the Company and its subsidiaries.

        Under the merger agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of
the non-solicit provision of the merger agreement for at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock or more than 50% of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries on terms that our Board determines in good faith, after considering the advice of a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, and taking into account all circumstances reasonably deemed relevant by our Board,
would result in a transaction that if consummated is more favorable to our stockholders from a financial point of view than the merger contemplated by the
merger agreement (taking into account any proposal by Reckitt Benckiser to amend the terms of the merger agreement).

        As of the merger agreement date, we were obligated to, and to cause our subsidiaries and our, its and our respective affiliates' directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants or other representatives retained in connection with the merger, and to use reasonable best efforts to
cause certain other representatives, to cease and terminate any and all existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third party conducted prior to
the date of the merger agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and request return or destruction of all information about the Company that we
may have provided.

Reckitt Benckiser Adverse Recommendation Change 

        Except as permitted by the following sentence, Reckitt Benckiser and its subsidiaries will not, and will not authorize or permit their respective
representatives to, directly or indirectly, fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company, or publicly propose to fail to make,
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company, the Reckitt Benckiser board of directors' recommendation in the circular to be prepared and
published by Reckitt Benckiser in accordance with its obligations under the listing rules of the United Kingdom Listing Authority (the "Circular") that the
Reckitt Benckiser stockholders approve the merger (any of the foregoing, a "Reckitt Benckiser Adverse Recommendation Change"). At any time prior to
obtaining the requisite Reckitt Benckiser stockholder approval, the board of directors of Reckitt Benckiser may effect a Reckitt Benckiser Adverse
Recommendation Change, if the board of directors of Reckitt Benckiser determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with Reckitt Benckiser's directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law,
provided, that unless and until the merger agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the merger agreement and the merger will be submitted to
Reckitt Benckiser's stockholders at the Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting notwithstanding any Reckitt Benckiser Adverse Recommendation Change.

Debt Financing 

        Prior to entering into the merger agreement, Reckitt Benckiser entered into a definitive credit facilities agreement with certain financial institutions
pursuant to which Reckitt Benckiser would be provided debt financing (the "Debt Financing") on the terms and conditions set forth in the definitive credit
facilities agreement, the proceeds of which, among other uses, would be used by Reckitt Benckiser to fund a portion of the merger consideration. Reckitt
Benckiser and Merger Sub are obligated to use their reasonable best efforts to arrange, as promptly as practicable, for the Debt Financing to be in place at
or prior to the effective time of the merger. Reckitt Benckiser is prohibited from amending the terms of the debt commitment letters without our prior
written consent if such amendments would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of Reckitt Benckiser or Merger Sub to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or adversely affects the ability of Reckitt Benckiser or Merger Sub to enforce its
rights against the other parties to

such Debt Financing agreement. If for any reason Reckitt Benckiser determines that the Debt Financing will not be available to them as contemplated,
Reckitt Benckiser has the obligation to notify us and then use reasonable best efforts to arrange for alternative financing in an amount sufficient to cover
such portion of the Debt Financing not available (to the extent such portion will not instead by funded by Reckitt Benckiser in cash). The merger
agreement provides, however, that obtaining the Debt Financing or alternative financing is not a condition to close. We have also agreed, at Reckitt
Benckiser's expense, to use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Reckitt Benckiser in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as
reasonably requested, including providing certain financial information.

Company Stockholder Meeting 

        We have agreed to cause a meeting of our stockholders to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably practicable (and, subject to the Company's
right to adjourn or postpone the meeting as set forth in the following sentence, in any event, within 40 days) after clearance of this proxy statement by the
SEC for the purpose of approving and adopting the merger agreement (the "Company stockholder meeting"). The Company is not permitted, without the
prior written consent of Reckitt Benckiser, to adjourn, postpone or otherwise delay the Company stockholder meeting, provided that the Company may,
without the prior written consent of Reckitt Benckiser, adjourn or postpone the Company stockholder meeting, after consultation with Reckitt Benckiser, if
the Company believes in good faith that such adjournment or postponement is reasonably necessary to allow reasonable additional time to (i) if there are
not sufficient affirmative votes in person or by proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum or to obtain the requisite stockholder approval, solicit
additional proxies necessary to obtain a quorum or the requisite stockholder approval at the Company stockholder meeting (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof), (ii) distribute any supplement or amendment to this proxy statement that our Board has determined in good faith after consultation
with outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable law and for such supplement or amendment to be reviewed by our stockholders prior to the
Company stockholder meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof) or (iii) ensure that the Company stockholder meeting and the Reckitt
Benckiser stockholder meeting are held on the same date and at the same time.

        In addition, our Board has agreed to (i) recommend adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders and include such recommendation in this
proxy statement and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval, provided that our Board may change its
recommendation in the manner described above in the subsection entitled "—No Solicitation of an Acquisition Proposal; Company Adverse
Recommendation Change" on page 88.

        Reckitt Benckiser has agreed to cause a general meeting of the stockholders of Reckitt Benckiser to be convened as soon as reasonably practicable
(and, subject to Reckitt Benckiser's right to adjourn or postpone the meeting as set forth in the following sentence, in any event, within 28 days) after
approval of the Circular by the United Kingdom Listing Authority. Reckitt Benckiser is not permitted, without the prior written consent of the Company, to
adjourn, postpone or otherwise delay the Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting, provided that Reckitt Benckiser may, without the prior written consent of
the Company, adjourn or postpone the Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting, after consultation with the Company, if Reckitt Benckiser believes in good
faith that such adjournment or postponement is reasonably necessary to allow reasonable additional time to (i) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes

Adverse Recommendation Change" on page 91.

Efforts to Complete the Merger 

        Each of the Company and Reckitt Benckiser will use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law to consummate the merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement as promptly as practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) take such actions as are necessary to cause
the closing conditions in the merger agreement to be satisfied, (ii) prepare, make and file all notices, statements, filings, submissions of information,
applications and other documents with any governmental authorities as are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the merger and the other

approvals, authorizations, clearances, actions, non-actions, waivers, licenses, registrations, permits, variance, exemptions, orders and other confirmations

agreement and (iv) cooperate to the extent reasonable with the other parties to the merger agreement in their respective efforts to comply with their
respective obligations under the merger agreement.

        Both Reckitt Benckiser and the Company will share the right to control and direct the defense of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement before any governmental authority, including by, in cooperation with the other party, scheduling, and directing strategy for, any meetings and
negotiations with, governmental authorities regarding the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        Prior to the closing, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each party to the merger agreement will (i) consult with the other parties thereto with

counsel) copies of), all filings made by such party with any governmental authority or any other information supplied by such party to, or meetings,
conferences or correspondence with, any governmental authority in connection the merger agreement, the merger or the other transactions contemplated by

        Reckitt Benckiser will not, nor will it permit its subsidiaries to acquire or agree to acquire any business, person or division thereof, or otherwise
acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if such actions, individually or in the aggregate, (i) would reasonably be expected to materially delay or to
materially increase the likelihood of not obtaining the applicable action, nonaction, waiver, clearance, consent or approval pursuant to the HSR Act or in
connection with any required governmental approval prior to the end date or (ii) would reasonably be expected to require any action, nonaction, waiver,
clearance, consent or approval of any other governmental authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, which would

        The Company must pay to Reckitt Benckiser a termination fee of $480,000,000 if any of the following occur:

• Reckitt Benckiser terminates the Merger Agreement because (i) our Board has made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
(ii) at any time after an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly proposed or publicly disclosed our Board has failed to publicly affirm the
Company Board Recommendation within five business days after receipt of any written request to do so from Reckitt Benckiser (provided
that Reckitt Benckiser may make such request only once with respect to each such Acquisition Proposal or material and publicly proposed
or disclosed amendment thereto); 

• any of the certain representatives of the Company listed in the disclosure schedule has willfully and materially breached, or has caused or
directed the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective representatives to materially breach, any of the Company's, its
subsidiaries or the Company representatives' obligations under the non-solicit provisions of the merger agreement, and such breach is
incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, has not been cured within five business days following written notice thereof from
Reckitt Benckiser; 

• prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders, we terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive,

change of control transaction or enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a change of control transaction.

        Reckitt Benckiser must pay the Company a termination fee of $480,000,000 if any of the following occur:

• the Company terminates the merger agreement because the board of directors of Reckitt Benckiser has failed to make, withdrawn or
modified in a manner adverse to the Company, or publicly proposed to fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the
Company, its recommendation that Reckitt Benckiser's stockholders approve the merger; or 

• the Company or Reckitt Benckiser terminates the merger agreement because the approval of the merger by Reckitt Benckiser's stockholders
has not been obtained at the Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting.

        If the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company or Reckitt Benckiser because the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders was
not obtained at the Company stockholder meeting, the Company must pay an amount equal to all out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses (including legal
fees and expenses) incurred by Reckitt Benckiser or any of its affiliates in connection with the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby subject to a cap of $20,000,000 (which reimbursement will reduce on a dollar for dollar basis any termination fee subsequently payable by the
Company).

Amendment and Waiver 

        Any provision of the merger agreement may be amended prior to the effective time if such amendment is executed in writing by each of the
Company, Reckitt Benckiser and Merger Sub; provided that after the merger agreement has been approved by our stockholders or Reckitt Benckiser's
stockholders there shall be no amendment or waiver that would require the further approval of the stockholders of the Company under Delaware law or the
stockholders of Reckitt Benckiser under the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Listing Authority without such approval having first been obtained. Any
provision of the merger agreement may be waived if such waiver is executed in writing by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

PROPOSAL NO. 2 

ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL 

        We are asking our stockholders to consider and vote upon a proposal to adjourn the special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to establish a quorum or adopt the merger agreement (which we refer to
as the Adjournment Proposal).

        You should note that the chairman of the meeting may postpone or adjourn the special meeting to a specified date including, among other reasons, to
solicit additional proxies or to hold the special meeting on the same date and at the same time as the Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting.

        If the special meeting is postponed or adjourned for any reason, including to solicit additional proxies or to hold the special meeting on the same date
and at the same time as the Reckitt Benckiser stockholder meeting, stockholders who have already sent in their proxies will be able to revoke them at any
time prior to their use. No proxy voted against the proposal to adopt the merger agreement will be voted in favor of the Adjournment Proposal. In the event
of a postponement or adjournment of the special meeting, we will provide at least ten days' notice of the new date, time and place of the special meeting,
as required by our bylaws.

Recommendation of Our Board 

        Our Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the Adjournment Proposal.

PROPOSAL NO. 3 

ADVISORY VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED COMPENSATION PROPOSAL 

        As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, we are required to submit a proposal to our
stockholders to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the payment of certain compensation and benefits to our named executive officers, which they
will or may become entitled to receive from the Company (or its successor) and as a consequence of the merger (which we refer to as the Merger-Related
Compensation Proposal). This merger-related compensation is summarized in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Interests of Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 66, including the footnotes and narrative disclosures in the subsection therein entitled "Potential
Change in Control Payments to Named Executive Officers" beginning on page 73.

        Our Board encourages you to review carefully the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal disclosed in this proxy statement.

        Our Board unanimously recommends that our stockholders approve the following resolution:

        "RESOLVED, that the stockholders of the Company hereby approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become
payable to the Company's named executive officers in connection with the merger, and the agreements and understandings pursuant to which such
compensation may be paid or become payable, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the table in the section of the proxy statement
titled "The Merger Agreement—Interests of Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Potential Change in Control Payments to Named Executive
Officers," including the related footnotes and narrative disclosures therein."

        The vote on the named executive officer merger-related compensation proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement. Accordingly, you may vote to adopt the merger agreement and vote not to approve the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal and vice
versa. Because the vote on the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on either the Company or Reckitt Benckiser.
Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted and the merger is completed, the compensation may be paid, subject only to the conditions applicable
thereto, regardless of the outcome of the non-binding, advisory vote of our stockholders.

        The above resolution approving the merger-related compensation of our named executive officers on an advisory basis will be approved if the votes
cast in favor of the proposal exceed the votes cast in opposition.

Recommendation of Our Board 

        Our Board unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote "FOR" the Merger-Related Compensation Proposal.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS 

        If the merger is consummated, our stockholders of record who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and who properly demand
appraisal of their shares will be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger under Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262").

        The following summary is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under the DGCL and is qualified in its entirety by the full
text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. The following summary does not constitute any legal or other advice and does
not constitute a recommendation that our stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262. Only a holder of record of shares of common stock
is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder's name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of common stock held
of record in the name of another person, such as a broker, bank or other agent, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized
below properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a broker, bank or other agent
and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your broker, bank or the other agent.

        Under Section 262, holders of record of shares of common stock who (1) do not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement; (2) continuously are the record holders of such shares through the effective date of the merger; and (3) otherwise follow the procedures set
forth in Section 262 will be entitled to have their shares appraised by the Delaware Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the "fair value" of
the shares of common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest to be
paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery.

        Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption and approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less
than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to appraisal rights that appraisal rights are available and include in the
notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes notice to our stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the merger,
and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this proxy statement as Annex D. In connection with the merger, any holder of shares of common stock who
wishes to exercise appraisal rights, or who wishes to preserve such holder's right to do so, should review Annex D carefully. Failure to strictly comply with
the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of appraisal rights under the DGCL. A stockholder who loses his, her
or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the merger consideration described in the merger agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the
procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of common stock, we believe that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, that
stockholder should seek the advice of legal counsel.

        Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of common stock must do ALL of the following:

• the stockholder must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement; 

• the stockholder must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal before the vote on the merger agreement at the special
meeting; 

• the stockholder must continuously hold the shares from the date of making the demand through the effective date of the merger (a
stockholder will lose appraisal rights if the stockholder transfers the shares before the effective date of the merger); and 

• a stockholder or the surviving company must file a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery requesting a determination of the fair value
of the shares within 120 days after the effective date

of the merger. The surviving company is under no obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.

        Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, a
stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the merger agreement, abstain or not vote its
shares. However, if your shares are held in street name, and you fail to instruct your broker, bank or other agent on how to vote your shares, your shares
will not be voted.

Filing Written Demand 

        Any holder of shares of common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to the Company, before the vote on the adoption of the
merger agreement at the special meeting, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder's shares, and that stockholder must not vote or submit a
proxy in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. A holder of shares of common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the shares on
the date the written demand for appraisal is made and must continue to hold the shares of record through the effective date of the merger. A proxy that is
submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and it will constitute a
waiver of the stockholder's right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a stockholder who submits
a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement or
abstain from voting on the adoption of the merger agreement. Neither voting against the adoption of the merger agreement nor abstaining from voting or
failing to vote on the adoption of the merger agreement will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying the requirements of
Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on the adoption of the merger agreement. A
proxy or vote against the adoption of the merger agreement will not constitute a demand. A stockholder's failure to make the written demand prior to the
taking of the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement at the special meeting will constitute a waiver of appraisal rights.

        Only a holder of record of shares of common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in that holder's name. A demand for
appraisal in respect of shares of common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder of record, and must reasonably inform the Company of the
identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand appraisal of the holder's shares in connection with the merger. If the shares are
owned of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the record owner,
and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy or tenancy in common, the demand should be executed by or on behalf
of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a
holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as
agent for the record owner or owners.

        STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OTHER AGENT FORMS AND WHO WISH
TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR BROKER, BANK OR OTHER AGENTS, AS APPLICABLE, TO
DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR THE BROKER, BANK OR OTHER AGENT TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL
OF THOSE SHARES. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES HELD OF RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON,
SUCH AS A BROKER, BANK OR OTHER AGENT, MUST ACT PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY
AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

        All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be mailed or delivered to:

Mead Johnson Nutrition Company
225 North Canal Street, 25th Floor

Chicago, Illinois 60606
(312) 466-5800

Attention: Patrick M. Sheller, General Counsel

        Any holder of shares of common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration offered pursuant to the merger
agreement by delivering to the Company a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal. However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made
more than 60 days after the effective date of the merger will require written approval of the surviving corporation. No appraisal proceeding in the
Delaware Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Delaware Court of Chancery, and such approval may be conditioned upon such
terms as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems just. In addition, the Delaware Court of Chancery will dismiss the appraisal proceedings as to all holders
of shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares of common stock entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the
outstanding shares of common stock, or (2) the value of the consideration provided in the merger for such total number of shares of common stock exceeds
$1 million.

Notice by the Surviving Corporation 

        If the merger is completed, within 10 days after the effective date of the merger, the surviving corporation will notify each holder of shares of
common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262, and who has not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger
agreement, that the merger has become effective and the effective date thereof.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal 

        Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, but not thereafter, the surviving corporation or any holder of shares of common stock who has
complied with Section 262 and is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Delaware
Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the surviving corporation in the case of a petition filed by a stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair
value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The surviving corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a
petition, and holders should not assume that the surviving corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the
shares of common stock. Accordingly, any holders of shares of common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary action
to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed in Section 262. The failure of a
holder of common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section 262 could nullify the stockholder's previous written demand for
appraisal.

        Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger, any holder of shares of common stock who has complied with the requirements for exercise of
appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the surviving corporation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares
not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and with respect to which the Company has received demands for appraisal, and the aggregate
number of holders of such shares. The surviving corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder within ten days after receipt of the
written request for such a statement or within ten days after the expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A
beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such person's own name, file a petition

seeking appraisal or request from the surviving corporation the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made
by a stockholder of record.

        If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the surviving corporation, the
surviving corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing
the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have
not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as required by the court, the Delaware Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the
petition to determine those stockholders who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to appraisal rights thereunder. The Delaware
Court of Chancery may require the stockholders who demanded payment for their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with the direction, the Delaware Court of Chancery
may dismiss that stockholder from the proceedings.

        After determining the holders of common stock entitled to appraisal, the Delaware Court of Chancery will appraise the "fair value" of the shares of
common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger, together with interest, if any, to be paid
upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Delaware Court of Chancery will take into account all relevant factors.
Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of
the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from
time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment
in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash (which will be treated as an advance
against the payment due to such stockholder), in which case interest shall accrue after such payment only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any,
between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless
paid at that time. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an
appraisal proceeding, stating that "proof of value by any techniques or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and
otherwise admissible in court" should be considered, and that "[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a
company." The Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger that throw any light on
future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be "exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger." In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a "narrow
exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value," but which rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such
accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that "elements of future value, including the nature of the
enterprise, which are known or susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered."

        Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery
could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek appraisal of their shares and
that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of the consideration payable in a merger is not an opinion as
to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL. Although we believe that the per share merger consideration is

Table of Contents

fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, and
stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the per share
merger consideration. Neither the Company nor Reckitt Benckiser anticipates offering more than the per share merger consideration to any stockholder
exercising appraisal rights, and each of the Company and Reckitt Benckiser reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of
Section 262, the "fair value" of a share of common stock is less than the per share merger consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then
the right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys' fees or the fees and expenses of experts) may be
determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Delaware Court of Chancery deems equitable under the circumstances.
Upon application of a stockholder, the Delaware Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of the expenses incurred by a stockholder in
connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the
value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.

        If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or loses or successfully
withdraws, such holder's right to appraisal, the stockholder's shares of common stock will be deemed to have been converted at the effective date of the
merger into the right to receive the per share merger consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or effectively lose or withdraw, the holder's right to
appraisal if, among other things, no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or if the stockholder delivers to the
surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the holder's demand for appraisal and an acceptance of the per share merger consideration in accordance
with Section 262.

        From and after the effective date of the merger, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of common
stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock, except dividends or other distributions on the holder's shares
of common stock, if any, payable to stockholders as of a time prior to the effective date of the merger. If no petition for an appraisal is filed, or if the
stockholder delivers to the surviving corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger, either within
60 days after the effective date of the merger or thereafter with the written approval of the surviving corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an
appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the Delaware Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as
to any stockholder who commenced the proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval of the court.

        Failure to comply strictly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 may result in the loss of a stockholder's statutory appraisal rights.
Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        If the merger is completed, there will be no public stockholders of the Company and no public participation in any future meetings of our
stockholders. However, if the merger is not completed on or before December 10, 2017, we will hold a 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2017
Annual Meeting"). In that event, stockholders wishing to submit proposals to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement must submit such
proposals to us so they are received by a reasonable time before we print and mail our proxy statement for the 2017 Annual Meeting and any such
proposals must comply with certain rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC.

        A stockholder who wishes to have a proposal considered at the 2017 Annual Meeting, if held, but does not seek to have the proposal included in our
proxy materials for that meeting must comply with the procedures specified by our bylaws. Our bylaws require all stockholders who intend to make
proposals at an annual meeting of stockholders to submit their proposal to the Corporate Secretary not fewer than 120 and not more than 150 days before
the anniversary date of the previous year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days
earlier or more than 60 days later than such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be received not earlier than 120 days prior to
such annual meeting and not later than the later of 90 days prior to such annual meeting or 10 days following the day on which the public announcement of
the date of such annual meeting is first made. Stockholder proposals or notices of proposal should be directed to Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, 225
North Canal Street, 25th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60606, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS 

        We have adopted a procedure approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission called "householding." Under this procedure, stockholders of
record who have the same address and last name and do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials will receive only one copy of the proxy
statement. This procedure is intended to reduce our printing costs and postage fees.

        If you or another stockholder of record with whom you share an address wish to receive a separate proxy statement, we will promptly deliver it to you
if you request it by calling Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., toll-free in the United States at (866) 540-7095 or by writing to Broadridge Financial
Solutions, Inc., Attention: Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717. If you or another stockholder of record with whom
you share an address are receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement, you can request to receive a single copy of these materials in the future by
contacting Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. in the same manner as described above.

        (b)   Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place (i) in New York City at the offices of
Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as possible, but in any event no later than three
Business Days after the date the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waiver of such conditions by the party or parties entitled to the benefit
thereof at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of
such conditions, or (ii) at such other place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree (the date on
which the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date").

        (c)   At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall file a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other
filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective
Time") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be agreed by Parent and the
Company and specified in the certificate of merger).

        (d)   From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject
to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware Law.

        Section 2.02.    Conversion of Shares.     At the Effective Time:

        (a)   Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c), Section 2.04 or Section 2.05, each share of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $90.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
accordance with Section 2.03, without interest. For the sake of clarity, any dividends that are declared by the Board of Directors of the Company in
accordance with the terms hereof having a record date prior to the Effective Time which remain unpaid as of the Effective Time shall be satisfied
by the Company on the payment date prescribed by the Board of Directors of the Company for such dividend even if such date occurs after the
Effective Time.

        (b)   Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares held for the account of clients, customers or other Persons) shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

        (c)   Each share of Company Common Stock held by Parent or by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into such number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that Parent or each such Subsidiary, as
applicable, owns the same percentage of Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as Parent or such Subsidiary owned in
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        (d)   Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and, except as provided
in Section 2.02(c), shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

        Section 2.03.    Surrender and Payment.     (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange
Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the "Certificates")
or (ii) subject to Section 2.05, uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Parent shall make available, or shall cause
to be made available, to the Exchange Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares.
Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at
the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

        (b)   Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt
of an "agent's message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the
case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall
represent for all purposes after the Effective Time only the right to receive such Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article 2.

        (c)   If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or
the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

        (d)   After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

        (e)   Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to, or as directed by, Parent (or a Subsidiary
of Parent that appointed the Exchange Agent, if any), upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common
Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Parent nor such Subsidiary, if any, shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common
Stock immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall
become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent or such Subsidiary, as applicable, free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

        (f)    Subject to Section 2.04, any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) to
pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to, or as directed by, Parent (or a
Subsidiary of Parent that appointed the Exchange Agent, if any), upon demand.

        (g)   Subject to Section 2.03(c)(ii), the payment of any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and other Taxes and
fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the Merger, and the filing of any related Tax returns and other
documentation with respect to such Taxes and fees, shall be borne by the Surviving Corporation.

        Section 2.04.    Dissenting Shares.     Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such
shares in accordance with Delaware Law ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such shares, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares and Parent shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to all such demands.
Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

        Section 2.05.    Employee Equity.     (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt resolutions to effect the following:

          (i)  adjust the terms of all outstanding Stock Options, whether vested or unvested, as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time,
each Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and the holder thereof shall then become entitled
to receive solely, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Stock Option has not been exercised and (B) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Stock Option; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, each Stock Option
with an exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time for no
consideration;

         (ii)  adjust the terms of all outstanding RSUs, other than RSUs granted after the date of this Agreement (the "2017 RSUs"), as
necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each such RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive solely, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a lump-
sum cash payment equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such RSU immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (B) the Merger Consideration;

        (iii)  adjust the terms of all outstanding PSUs, other than PSUs granted after the date of this Agreement (the "2017 PSUs"), as
necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each such PSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
the holder thereof shall then become entitled to receive solely, in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, a lump-
sum cash payment equal to the product of (A) the PSU Amount and (B) the Merger Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, "PSU
Amount" means, with respect to any PSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares of Company Common
Stock equal to the sum of (1) the total

performance goals applicable to such award for any completed one-year performance period ending prior to the Effective Time, as
reasonably determined by the Board of Directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) prior to the Effective Time, and assuming the
satisfaction of all other conditions to such delivery, and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such award that
would be delivered to the holder of such award based on target achievement of the performance goals applicable to such award for any one-
year performance period that has not been completed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and assuming the satisfaction of all
other conditions to such delivery; and

        (iv)  provide terms for all of the 2017 RSUs and 2017 PSUs that are consistent with the provisions set forth in Section 6.01(j) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

        (b)   The Surviving Corporation shall pay all amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.05 as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event
no later than five days) after the Effective Time.

        Section 2.06.    Adjustments.     Without limiting or affecting any of the provisions of Section 6.01, if, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, subdivision or other similar transaction, or any stock dividend thereon
with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted
to eliminate the effect of such event on the Merger Consideration or any such other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement.

        Section 2.07.    Withholding Rights.     Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and Parent, and any of their respective Affiliates, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration or any payment
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of Applicable Law, including federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, or any such Affiliate, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, or such Affiliate, as the case
may be, made such deduction and withholding.

        Section 2.08.    Lost Certificates.     If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

of its Subsidiaries has received notice that it has breached, violated or defaulted under any Material Contract.

        Section 4.21.    Insurance.     The Company has delivered or otherwise made available to Parent a copy of all material insurance policies and all

Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.

material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the

        Section 5.07.    Financing; Sufficiency of Funds.     (a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of a fully executed, definitive
credit facilities agreement entered into with the financial institution(s) named therein, pursuant to which such financial institution(s) (together with the
financial institution(s) providing any Alternative Financing or Replacement Debt Financing, the "Financing Sources") have committed, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to provide the debt financing described therein in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Such credit facilities agreement, together with any similar financing agreement executed in accordance with Section 7.06 (including any
replacement thereof in connection with any Alternative Financing or Replacement Debt Financing), as replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or
waived in accordance with Section 7.06, and including all exhibits, schedules, and annexes to such agreements, are hereinafter referred to together as the
"Debt Financing Agreements." The financing contemplated pursuant to the Debt Financing Agreements is hereinafter referred to as the "Debt
Financing".

        (b)   As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Financing Agreements are in full force and effect and are legal, valid and binding obligations
of Parent, and to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, and are enforceable in accordance with their respective terms against Parent,
and to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity). None of the Debt Financing Agreements will be
amended or modified except in accordance with Section 7.06. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (i) constitute a material breach or default by Parent under any Debt Financing
Agreement, (ii) to the knowledge of Parent, result in the failure of any condition contained in any Debt Financing Agreement to be satisfied or
(iii) to the knowledge of Parent, result in the commitments provided in any Debt Financing Agreement being unavailable on the Closing Date. The
consummation of the Debt Financing is subject to no conditions precedent other than those expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Agreements,
and to the knowledge of the Parent there are no contingencies that would permit the Financing Sources to reduce the total amount of the Debt
Financing, other than in each case those conditions or contingencies expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Agreements. Except for fee letters
relating to fees with respect to the Debt Financing (redacted copies of which, removing fee amounts, market "flex" provisions and certain other
terms (none of which would adversely affect the amounts or availability of the Debt Financing), have been provided to the Company) and a
mandate letter setting out the mandates and roles awarded to the financing banks and certain syndication related provisions, there are no side letters
or other Contracts to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party directly related to the quantum or conditionality of the Debt Financing, other than the
Debt Financing Agreements. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming no breach by the Company of its representations or warranties hereunder,
and the Company's compliance with its covenants and agreements hereunder (including Section 6.05), Parent has no reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on or prior to the
Closing Date. Parent has, or at the Closing will have, whether through proceeds from the Debt Financing, cash or cash equivalents held by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub, or otherwise, sufficient cash to enable Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to pay or cause to be paid all
amounts required to be paid by them or required to be caused by them to be paid in cash in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the aggregate Merger Consideration and all payments, fees and expenses payable by them arising out of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        (c)   Without limiting Section 11.13, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any financing to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other
financing transaction be a condition to Closing or to any of the other obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder.

Branch, whose fees will be paid by Parent, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to
act on behalf of Parent who might be entitled to any fee or commission from the Company or any of its Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

        Section 5.09.    Interested Stockholder.     Neither Parent nor Merger Sub, nor any of their "affiliates" or "associates" has been an "interested
stockholder" of the Company at any time within three years of the date of this Agreement, as those terms are used in Section 203 of Delaware Law.

        Section 5.10.    Litigation.     There is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding pending against, or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against
or affecting, Parent, any of its Subsidiaries, any present or former officer, director or employee of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any Person for
whom Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may be liable or any of their respective properties before (or, in the case of threatened actions, suits, investigations
or proceedings, would be before) or by any Governmental Authority or arbitrator, that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

        Section 5.11.    Agreements and Understandings.     Parent has disclosed to the Company all written contracts or arrangements as of the date of this
Agreement, (and Parent has furnished to the Company correct and complete copies thereof) between or among Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary
of Parent, on the one hand, and (a) any member of the Board of Directors of the Company or management of the Company or (b) any Person that owns 5%
or more of the shares of the outstanding capital stock of the Company (based on information filed with the SEC), on the other hand, in each case that relate
in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        Section 5.12.    No Other Representations; No Reliance; Waiver.     Parent and Merger Sub have conducted their own independent review and analysis
of the Company and, based thereon, have formed an independent judgment concerning the business, assets, condition, operations and prospects of the
Company. Each of Parent and Merger Sub represents, warrants, acknowledges and agrees that other than as expressly set forth in Article 4 of this
Agreement, none of the Company, any of its Affiliates or stockholders or any of their respective Representatives makes or has made any representation or
warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information provided or made available to Parent, Merger Sub, any of their
Affiliates or stockholders or any of their respective Representatives (collectively, the "Parent Related Persons") in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future
revenues, expenses or expenditures, future results of operations, future cash flows or future financial condition, or any component of the foregoing, or any
other forward looking information, of the Company or any of its Affiliates, and no Parent Related Person has relied on any information or statements made
or provided (or not made or provided) to any Parent Related Person other than the representations and warranties of the Company expressly set forth in
Article 4 of this Agreement.

of this Section 6.03(b), Section 6.03(c) and Section 6.03(d), at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders
(but in no event after the adoption of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders):

Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 6.03, (A) the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may contact
such Third Party for the sole purpose of clarifying the terms and conditions thereof and (B) if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after considering advice from a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel to
the Company, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then the
Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (x) furnish information (including non-public information) relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Third Party that has made such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with
such Third Party with terms no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those provided in the Confidentiality Agreement,

include provisions requiring exclusive negotiations (an "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement"), a copy of which confidentiality
agreement with such Third Party shall be provided to Parent promptly after the execution thereof; provided that, to the extent that any such
information furnished to such Third Party or its Representatives has not been previously provided or made available to Parent or its
Representatives, all such information shall be promptly (and in any event within twenty-four hours) provided or made available to Parent

        (iii)  other than in connection with a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change,

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), only if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
considering advice from a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel to the Company, that the failure to take
such action would (or, in the case of clause (i), could) reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.
Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors of the Company from (A) complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal so long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with this Section 6.03; provided that
unless the Board of Directors of the Company reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such action
by the close of business on the 10th Business Day after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal under Rule 14e-2(a), such action shall be
deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) issuing "stop, look and listen" disclosure or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act.

Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives of any Acquisition Proposal, any bona fide written indication that a Third
Party intends to make an Acquisition Proposal or any written request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that intends to make an
Acquisition Proposal in connection therewith. The Company shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any
such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including any material changes thereto). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on

Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 6.03(b)(iii), a reasonably detailed description of the facts relating to such Adverse

discussed and negotiated in good faith (in each case to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with Parent and its Representatives regarding any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal or potential Adverse Recommendation Change, as
applicable and (iii) after such four Business Day period, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after
considering advice from a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation (in the case of a Superior Proposal) and outside legal counsel to the
Company, and taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement made during such period, that (A) in the case of
clause (x) above, such Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and (B) in the case of clause (x) or (y), the failure to take such
action would continue to reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law (it being understood and agreed

consummation, any governmental or other approval requirements, any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to
consummation, availability of necessary financing and other financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal), would
result in a transaction that if consummated, is more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than as provided
hereunder (taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(d)).

        (f)    Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions.    The Company shall, shall cause each Company Transaction Representative to, and shall

Parent Shareholder Circular and any information and comfort letters required in relation to the preparation of the Parent Shareholder Circular. Any
investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. All information furnished pursuant to this Section shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that in no event shall
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement be deemed to prevent the disclosure of any information by Parent (A) to Parent Sponsor or the UKLA, or

matters of procedure and matters required by Applicable Law to be voted on by Parent's shareholders in connection with the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) that Parent shall propose to be acted on by the stockholders of Parent at the Parent
Shareholder Meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof).

        Section 7.03.    Parent Board Recommendation.     Except as permitted by the following sentence, Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not, and shall not
authorize or permit their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company, or
publicly propose to fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Company, the Parent Board Recommendation (any of the foregoing in this
sentence, a "Parent Adverse Recommendation Change"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent
Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors of Parent may effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, if the Board of Directors of Parent
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with Parent's directors' fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided, however, that, unless and until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms, this Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to Parent's shareholders at the Parent Shareholder Meeting notwithstanding any Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change.

        Section 7.04.    Director and Officer Liability.     Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

        (a)   For not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers, employees and directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
and each individual who is serving or has served at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
employee of another Person (each such director, officer, employee, an "Indemnified Person") who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a
party to any actual or threatened claim, audit, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (other than an action by or in the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or employee of the Company, or is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company serving at the request of the Company as
a director, officer or employee with respect to, another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against any resulting claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, fines, judgments, settlements and reasonable fees and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, and
other costs, arising therefrom. The Surviving Corporation shall promptly advance any reasonable expenses as incurred by any such Indemnified
Person in connection with any such claim, audit, action, suit, proceeding or investigation; provided, that any Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. The Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with each Indemnified Person in the
defense of any action.

        (b)   For not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain in effect provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the business of
the Surviving Corporation) which provide for exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for each Indemnified Person with respect
to any matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the
corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement.

        (c)   At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be permitted to, and if the Company is unable to, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, purchase a

prepaid directors' and officers' liability "tail" insurance policy or other comparable directors' and officers' liability and fiduciary liability policies, in
each case providing coverage for claims asserted prior to and for six years after the Effective Time with respect to any matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (and, with respect to claims made prior to or during such period, until final resolution thereof), with levels of
coverage, terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as those contained in the Company's directors' and
officers' insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies in effect as of the date hereof (the "D&O Insurance"); provided that if the
aggregate annual cost for such insurance coverage exceeds 300% of the current annual premium paid by the Company (which amount is set forth
in Section 7.04(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), the Surviving Corporation shall instead be obligated to obtain D&O Insurance with the
best available coverage with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for an aggregate annual cost of 300% of the current
annual premium.

        (d)   If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.04.

        (e)   The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

        Section 7.05.    Employee Matters.     (a) During the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2018 (or such shorter period
of employment, as the case may be) (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to each employee who is actively
employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time, including any employee who is out on leave or disability (to the extent that such items
are applicable to such inactive employees) (each, a "Covered Employee"), (i) base salary, base wage rate and annual cash incentive opportunities that are
no less favorable, in each case, than the base salary, base wage rate and annual cash incentive opportunities that were provided to such Covered Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other benefits in the aggregate that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and
benefits (other than equity compensation and other long-term incentives, change in control, retention, transition, stay or similar arrangements to the extent
such benefits are paid to a Covered Employee) that were provided to such Covered Employee under the Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

        (b)   During the Continuation Period, in the event that a Covered Employee's employment with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries is terminated or such Person takes any other action that would have entitled such Covered Employee to receive severance
payments and benefits under the Company's severance plans or practices as in effect as of the date of this Agreement and as set forth on
Section 7.05 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Company Severance Practice"), the Surviving Corporation, Parent or their Affiliates or
Subsidiaries shall provide such Covered Employee with severance payments and benefits no less favorable than the severance payments and
benefits determined pursuant to the Company Severance Practice determined using such Covered Employee's then current compensation and years
of service (determined in accordance with this Agreement).

        (c)   In the event any Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate under any employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Parent Employee Benefit Plan") following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) waive any preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such Covered Employee under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan providing medical, dental,
vision or other health benefits to the same extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the corresponding employee benefit
plan such Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under such Parent Employee Benefit Plan and (ii) provide such
Covered Employee with credit for any copayments and deductibles paid prior to such Covered Employee's coverage under any Parent Employee
Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which such amount was paid, to the same extent such credit was given under the employee benefit plan
such Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under such Parent Employee Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under such Parent Employee Benefit Plan.

        (d)   As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, recognize all service of each Covered Employee prior to the
Effective Time, with the Company and its Subsidiaries for vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes, except for
purposes of vacation, severance and matching contributions to defined contribution retirement plans (other than as set forth herein), as applicable)
to the same extent recognized under the corresponding Employee Plans; provided, however, that for the avoidance of doubt, service of each
Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time shall not be recognized for the purpose of any entitlement to participate in, or receive benefits with
respect to, any: (i) defined benefit pension plan maintained by Parent or (ii) Parent retiree medical program or other retiree welfare benefit program
in which any Covered Employee participates after the Effective Time. In no event shall anything contained in this Section 7.04 result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

        (e)   Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute a "change in control"
or "change of control" of the Company for purposes of any Employee Plan that contains a definition of "change in control" or "change of control",
as applicable.

        (f)    Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06, nothing in this Section 7.04, express or implied, (i) is intended to or shall confer upon
any Person other than the parties hereto, including any Covered Employee, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, (ii) shall establish, or constitute an amendment, termination or modification of, or an undertaking to amend, establish,
terminate or modify, any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates (or,
following the Effective Time, the Company or any of its Affiliates) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them or (iv) shall create any obligation on the part of Parent or
its Affiliates (or, following the Effective Time, the Company or any of its Affiliates) to employ any Covered Employee for any period following
the Closing Date.

        Section 7.06.    Financing.     (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Financing Agreements, including
using its reasonable best efforts to satisfy (or if determined advisable by Parent, obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing contained in the Debt Financing Agreements to the extent such conditions are within Parent's and Merger Sub's control. Parent shall give the
Company prompt notice of (x) any material breach by any party to the Debt

Financing Agreements of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware which would cause the Debt Financing to become unavailable, (y) any termination
of any of the Debt Financing Agreements or (z) the receipt of any notice from any Financing Source with respect to such Financing Source's failure or
anticipated failure to fund its commitments under any Debt Financing Agreements. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable (it being
understood that Parent and/or Merger Sub shall have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated equity offerings or debt offerings or incurrences
of debt for all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Agreements by reducing commitments under the Debt Financing
Agreements), each of Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such
unavailability, alternative debt financing for such portion thereof (to the extent such portion will not instead be funded by Parent and/or Merger Sub (at
their sole discretion) from cash or cash equivalents) from alternative debt financing sources ("Alternative Financing") in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and, if known and not subject
to any obligation of confidentiality, the reason therefor. If obtained, Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all agreements (other
than any fee letters, mandate letters and engagement letters) pursuant to which any such alternative financing source shall have committed to provide
Parent or Merger Sub with Alternative Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall not, without the Company's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), agree to any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, any Debt Financing
Agreement unless the terms and conditions of such Debt Financing Agreement (taken as a whole), as so amended, modified or waived, are no more
onerous on Parent (in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as those contained in such Debt Financing Agreement prior to giving effect to such amendment,
modification or waiver; provided that in the case of amendments or modifications of any Debt Financing Agreement, the foregoing shall only apply if such
amendment or modification (A) would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) adversely affects the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to
such Debt Financing Agreement. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to
consummate the Debt Financing.

        (b)   Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, in its sole discretion and at any time, may replace any Debt
Financing Agreement with another commitment letter, definitive credit facility or other financing agreement (a "Replacement Debt Financing
Agreement") pursuant to which any financial institution(s) selected by Parent in its sole discretion commit to provide debt financing to finance the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Replacement Debt Financing") and at any time after the effectiveness thereof Parent may, in its
sole discretion, terminate the applicable Debt Financing Agreement and the commitments thereunder; provided that, without the Company's prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), the terms and conditions of any Replacement Debt Financing (taken as a
whole) shall be no more onerous on Parent (in the reasonable judgment of Parent) as those contained in the Debt Financing Agreement(s) being
replaced. Promptly after the termination of any Debt Financing Agreement and the execution of any Replacement Debt Financing Agreement by
Parent in accordance with this Section 7.05(b), Parent shall notify the Company of such events and provide fully executed copies of such
Replacement Debt Financing Agreement and any agreements relating thereto (other than any fee letters or engagement letters).

        (c)   For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the receipt or availability of any financing to Parent or any of its Affiliates or any other
financing transaction be a condition to Closing or to any of the other obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder.

or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement before any Governmental Authority, and shall thereafter keep the Company reasonably

documentary material that may be requested by any Governmental Authority pursuant to the HSR Act or such other Competition Laws, and shall
use their reasonable best efforts to take all other actions necessary to cause the condition set forth in Section 9.01(c) to be satisfied as soon as
practicable and in any event prior to the End Date. Other than as set forth in the immediately following sentence, neither Parent nor Company shall
consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). Notwithstanding the prior sentence or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent may consent to one or
more voluntary extensions of applicable statutory deadlines or waiting periods or to one or more voluntary delays of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Authority for no more than 30 days in the aggregate; provided,
however, prior to agreeing to any such extension, Parent shall consult with and consider in good faith the views of the Company with respect
thereto.

        The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01 (other than pursuant to Section 10.01(a)) shall give notice of such

provided that, subject to Section 10.03(f), no such termination shall relieve or otherwise affect the liability of any party hereto for fraud or any material
breach of this Agreement by such party prior to termination, which breach is the consequence of an act or omission by such party with the actual
knowledge that such act or omission would be a material breach of this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 10.02, the final sentence of

Parent (the "Parent Fee Designee"), by way of compensation, $480,000,000 (the "Termination Fee") within one Business Day after the
date of the termination of the Agreement (in the case of any such termination by Parent) or concurrently with, and as a condition precedent
to, the termination of the Agreement (in the case of any such termination by the Company).

         (ii)  If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iii), then the Company shall pay to Parent

contemplated hereby (including obtaining the Debt Financing or any Bond Refinancing) subject to cap on such reimbursement of
$20,000,000 ("Parent Cost Reimbursement"), within one Business Day after the date of the termination of the Agreement (in the case of

such termination by the Company), and in addition, if (A) prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal
shall have been publicly proposed or publicly disclosed and not publicly withdrawn and (B) within 12 months following the date of such

pay to Parent or the Parent Fee Designee, as applicable, by way of compensation, an amount equal to the Termination Fee, less any
amounts already paid to Parent with respect to the Parent Cost Reimbursement, within one Business Day after the first date on which the
Company enters into such definitive agreement or consummates such transaction.

        (iii)  If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i) and (A) prior to the date of such
termination a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or publicly disclosed and not publicly withdrawn, and
(B) within 12 months following the date of such termination, the Company shall have consummated an Acquisition Proposal or entered
into a definitive agreement providing for a transaction that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (provided that for purposes of this
clause (iii), each reference to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%"), then the
Company shall pay to Parent or the Parent Fee Designee, by way of compensation, the Termination Fee within one Business Day after the
first date on which the Company enters into such definitive agreement or consummates such transaction; provided that no Termination Fee
shall be payable by the Company under this Section 10.03(a)(iii) if at the date of such termination, the condition set forth in Section 9.01(c)
has not been satisfied, or the condition set forth in Section 9.01(d) has not been satisfied solely in connection with any Restraint in respect
of any Competition Law.

        (b)    Parent Termination Fees.    

          (i)  If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(ii), then Parent shall pay to the Company, by way
of compensation, $480,000,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee"), within one Business Day after the date of the termination of the
Agreement.

         (ii)  If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(iv), then Parent shall pay to the Company,
by way of compensation, the Reverse Termination Fee, within one Business Day after the date of the termination of the Agreement (in the
case of any such termination by the Company) or concurrently with, and as a condition precedent to, the termination of the Agreement (in
the case of any such termination by Parent).

        (c)    VAT.    The parties anticipate that the Termination Fee, the Parent Cost Reimbursement and the Reverse Termination Fee, if paid, being
compensatory in nature, shall not be treated, in whole or in part, as consideration for a supply for VAT purposes. However, if under a reverse
charge mechanism, the Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, is or is deemed to be consideration, in whole or in part, for
a supply for VAT purposes, then the amount of the Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be reduced by an amount
such that the sum payable by Parent or the Company, as applicable, when aggregated with any irrecoverable VAT in respect thereof, shall be equal
to the amount of the Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, that would be payable but for this Section 10.03(c). Such
adjusting payment or payments as may be required between the parties to give effect to this Section 10.03(c) shall be made as soon as reasonably
practicable.

        (d)    Payment.    Any payment of the Termination Fee, the Reverse Termination Fee or the Parent Cost Reimbursement shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent or the Parent Fee Designee, or the Company, as applicable.

        (e)    Costs and Expenses.    Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 10.03 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, such party would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if

incurred by the other party (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in
a judgment for such amount against the party failing to promptly pay such amount. Any amount not paid when due pursuant to this Section 10.03
shall bear interest from the date such amount is due until the date paid at a rate equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition, in effect on the date of such payment.

Fee on more than one occasion and in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one
occasion and (ii) in no event shall Parent or the Parent Fee Designee, as applicable, be entitled, pursuant to Section 10.03, to receive an amount
greater than the Termination Fee and in no event shall the Company be entitled, pursuant to Section 10.03(b), to receive an amount greater than the
Reverse Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except in the case of fraud of any party hereto, (x) if Parent
or the Parent Fee Designee, as applicable receives the Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to Section 10.03(a) or if the Company receives
the Reverse Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to Section 10.03(b), such payment, together with any costs, fees or expenses payable pursuant to
Section 10.03(e), shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the receiving party against the paying party and its Subsidiaries and their respective
former, current or future partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates and Representatives and none of the paying party, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future partners, stockholders, managers, members, Affiliates or Representatives shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) if (A) Parent or
Merger Sub receive any payments from the Company in respect of any breach of this Agreement and thereafter Parent receives the Termination
Fee pursuant to this Section 10.03, or (B) the Company receives any payments from Parent or Merger Sub in respect of any breach of this
Agreement and thereafter the Company receives the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 10.03, the amount of such Termination Fee
or Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of such payments made by the party paying the Termination
Fee or Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, in respect of any such breaches.

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL

February 10, 2017

Board of Directors
Mead Johnson Nutrition Company
2701 Patriot Boulevard
Glenview, Illinois 60026

Ladies and Gentlemen:

        You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc ("Reckitt
Benckiser") and its affiliates) of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), of Mead Johnson Nutrition Company
(the "Company") of the $90.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 10, 2017
(the "Agreement"), by and among Reckitt Benckiser Group, Marigold Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Reckitt Benckiser ("Acquisition
Sub"), and the Company.

        Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research,
investment management and other financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its
affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest,
may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default
swaps and other financial instruments of the Company, Reckitt Benckiser, any of their respective affiliates and third parties, or any currency or commodity
that may be involved in the transaction contemplated by the Agreement (the "Transaction"). We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in
connection with, and have participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the Transaction. We expect to receive fees for our services in connection
with the Transaction, all of which are contingent upon consummation of the Transaction, and the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses
arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement. We have provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting
services to the Company and/or its affiliates from time to time. We have provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to Reckitt
Benckiser and/or its affiliates from time to time. We may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the Company,
Reckitt Benckiser and their respective affiliates for which our Investment Banking Division may receive compensation.

        In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things, the Agreement; annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on
Form 10-K of the Company for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2015; certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-
Q of the Company; certain other communications from the Company to its stockholders; certain publicly available research analyst reports for the
Company; and certain internal financial analyses and forecasts for the Company prepared by its management, as approved for our use by the Company (the
"Forecasts"). We have also held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company regarding their assessment of the past and current
business operations, financial condition and future prospects of the Company; reviewed the reported price and trading activity for the Shares; compared
certain financial and stock market information for the Company with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly
traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations in the food industry and in other industries; and performed such other studies
and analyses, and considered such other factors, as we deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of rendering this opinion, we have, with your consent, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the financial,
legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, us, without assuming any responsibility for
independent verification thereof. In that regard, we have assumed with your consent that the Forecasts have been reasonably prepared on a basis reflecting
the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company. We have not made an independent evaluation or appraisal of the
assets and liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries and we
have not been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. We have assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals
necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way
meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the Agreement, without the waiver or
modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.

        Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction
as compared to any strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. We
were not requested to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination with, the
Company or any other alternative transaction. This opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than Reckitt
Benckiser and its affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the $90.00 in cash per Share to be paid to such holders pursuant to the Agreement. We do
not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any term or aspect of any other
agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including, the fairness of the
Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of
the Company; nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the
Company, or class of such persons, in connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the $90.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other
than Reckitt Benckiser and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. We are not expressing any opinion as to the impact of the
Transaction on the solvency or viability of the Company or Reckitt Benckiser or the ability of the Company or Reckitt Benckiser to pay their respective
obligations when they come due. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information
made available to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this opinion based on circumstances,
developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and
assistance of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration of the Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a
recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote with respect to such Transaction or any other matter. This opinion has been approved by a
fairness committee of Goldman, Sachs & Co.

        Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the $90.00 in cash per Share to be paid to the holders (other than
Reckitt Benckiser and its affiliates) of Shares pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

Very truly yours,

Members of the Board:

        We understand that Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (the "Company"), Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (the "Buyer") and Marigold Merger Sub, Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer ("Acquisition Sub"), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft
dated February 9th, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), which provides, among other things, for the merger (the "Merger") of Acquisition Sub with and into
the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer, and each outstanding share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), other than shares held in treasury (other than shares held for the account of
clients, customers or other persons) or held by the Buyer or any subsidiary of the Buyer or the Company or as to which dissenters' rights have been
perfected, will be converted into the right to receive $90.00 per share in cash, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances (the "Consideration"). The
terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

        You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders.

        For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:

1) Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company; 

2) Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company; 

3) Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the management of the Company; 

4) Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company with senior executives of the
Company;

6) Compared the financial performance of the Company and the prices and trading activity of the Company Common Stock with that of
certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with the Company and their securities; 

7) Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions; 

8) Reviewed the Merger Agreement, the draft credit facilities agreement from certain lenders substantially in the form of the draft dated
February 9th, 2017 (the "Credit Facilities Agreement") and certain related documents; and 

9) Performed such other analyses and reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed appropriate.

        We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was publicly available or
supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company, and formed a substantial basis for this opinion. With respect to the financial projections, we
have assumed that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the
Company of the future financial performance of the Company. In addition, we have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the
terms set forth in the Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the Buyer
will obtain financing in accordance with the terms set forth in the Credit Facilities Agreement, and that the definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in
any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary
governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be
imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We are not legal, tax or
regulatory advisors. We are financial advisors only and have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal,
tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. We express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the
compensation to any of the Company's officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the Consideration to be received by the
holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the transaction. We have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of
the Company, nor have we been furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and
other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events occurring after the date hereof may affect this
opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

        In arriving at our opinion, we were not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from any party with respect to the acquisition, business
combination or other extraordinary transaction, involving the Company, nor did we negotiate with any party with respect to a possible acquisition of the
Company or any of its constituent businesses.

        We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this transaction and will receive a fee for our
services, all of which is contingent upon the closing of the Merger. In the two years prior to the date hereof, Morgan Stanley and its affiliates have
provided financial advisory and financing services for the Buyer and the Company and have received fees in connection with such services. In addition,
Morgan Stanley or an affiliate thereof is currently a lender to the Buyer and the Company, and Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc, an affiliate of
Morgan Stanley, has been acting as joint corporate broker to the Buyer since November 2013 and have received fees in connection with such services.
Morgan Stanley may also seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Buyer and the Company and their respective affiliates in the
future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.

        Please note that Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment management and individual wealth
management businesses. Our securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities
and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking, financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates,

or otherwise structure and effect transactions, for their own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of the Buyer, the
Company, or any other company, or any currency or commodity, that may be involved in this transaction, or any related derivative instrument.

        (a)   Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise
complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to
§ 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder's shares of stock under the circumstances
described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the

instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is
deposited with the depository.

        (b)   Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this
title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available
for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders

        (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series
of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251,
252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except:

        a.     Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect
thereof;

        b.     Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in
respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities
exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

        c.     Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this

        d.     Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

        (3)   In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or § 267 of this title is
not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

        (4)   In the event of an amendment to a corporation's certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall be
available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment" substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word
"corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or "surviving or resulting corporation."

        (c)   Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class
or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent
corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions
of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

        (d)   Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

        (1)   If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a
meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the
record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for
which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of
the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder's shares shall deliver to the
corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder's shares. Such demand
will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the
appraisal of such stockholder's shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder
electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the effective date of such merger or
consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who has complied with this
subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become
effective; or

        (2)   If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation
before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the
holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or
consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall
include in such notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such
notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the
merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in the case of a
merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and
20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holder's shares.
Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to
demand the appraisal of such holder's shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either
(i) each such

constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class
or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the
surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided,
however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant
to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the
sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded
appraisal of such holder's shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of
the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the
facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance,
a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the
effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given.

        (e)   Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has
complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by
filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined
that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger
or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of
subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from
the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which
demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder
within 10 days after such stockholder's written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after
expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a)
of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in
such person's own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection.

        (f)    Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which
shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names
and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied
by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such
petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated.
Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in
the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such

publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall
be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

        (g)   At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to
appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to
submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails
to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares
of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the
Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of shares
entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration provided in the
merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

        (h)   After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of
the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value
of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if
any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors.
Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of
the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate
(including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the
judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an
amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so
paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the
surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial
upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the
surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholder's certificates of stock to the Register in
Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights
under this section.

        (i)    The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the
stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of
holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court's decree may be
enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of
any state.

        (j)    The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares
entitled to an appraisal.

        (k)   From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d)
of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends
or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that
if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or
resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholder's demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within
60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the
corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of
Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court
deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined
that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholder's demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

        (l)    The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they
assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.
