ANGIE'S LIST, INC.
1030 East Washington Street

Indianapolis, IN 46202

MERGER PROPOSAL—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

        Dear Stockholder:

        You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of the stockholders of Angie's List, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Angie's List"),
which will be held on September 29, 2017, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, at The Alexander, 333 S. Delaware St., Indianapolis, Indiana
46204.

        As previously announced, on May 1, 2017, Angie's List and IAC/InterActiveCorp, a Delaware corporation ("IAC"), entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the "Merger Agreement") to combine IAC's HomeAdvisor business and Angie's List under a
new publicly traded company to be called ANGI Homeservices Inc. In particular, the Merger Agreement provides for the acquisition of
Angie's List by ANGI Homeservices by way of the merger of Casa Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned
subsidiary of ANGI Homeservices, with and into Angie's List (the "Merger"), with Angie's List continuing as the surviving company in
the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of ANGI Homeservices. At the special meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon a
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive for each share of Angie's List common
stock that you own, at your election pursuant to the procedures further described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus, (i) one
share of ANGI Homeservices Inc. Class A common stock or (ii) $8.50 in cash, without interest. Elections to receive the cash consideration
by Angie's List stockholders will be subject to the proration procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement, such that Angie's List
stockholders will receive in the aggregate no more than $130 million in cash. Accordingly, depending on the elections made by the other
stockholders of Angie's List, unless you elect to receive exclusively share consideration you may receive share consideration and cash
consideration in a proportion different from what you request on your election form, as further described in the accompanying proxy
statement/prospectus. Upon completion of the Merger, Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices Inc. are expected to be listed on NASDAQ
under the current Angie's List ticker symbol, "ANGI." Following the Merger, Angie's List common stock will be delisted from NASDAQ,
deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and cease to be publicly traded.

        After careful consideration, the Angie's List board of directors unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and determined that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable to and in the best interests of Angie's List
stockholders. The Angie's List board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the adoption of the Merger Agreement.

        Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of Angie's List common stock you own. We cannot consummate the
Merger unless the Merger Agreement is adopted by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Angie's List
common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote, in person or by proxy, or fail to
give voting instructions to your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement.

        The accompanying proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed information about the special meeting, the Merger
Agreement and the Merger. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex B to the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus.
You are encouraged to read carefully the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety including the section entitled
"Risk Factors" beginning on page 33. You can also obtain information about Angie's List from documents that it has filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. See the section of the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus entitled "Where You Can Find
More Information."

        Thank you for your ongoing support and your consideration of this matter.

 Very truly yours,

 
/s/ SCOTT A. DURCHSLAG
Scott A. Durchslag

 President, Chief Executive Officer and Director

        Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of
the securities to be issued in connection with the Merger or determined that the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus is
accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

        The accompanying proxy statement/prospectus is dated August 30, 2017, and is first being mailed to Angie's List stockholders on or
about August 30, 2017.

        4.     to transact such other business as may properly come before the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement of
the special meeting.

        The Angie's List board of directors has fixed the close of business on Friday, August 25, 2017 as the record date for the purpose of
determining the stockholders who are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting. Only stockholders of record at the
close of business on the record date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the special meeting and at any adjournment or postponement of
that meeting. Each stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of Angie's List common stock held as of the close of business on the

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE TRANSACTIONS 

        The following section provides brief answers to certain questions that you may have regarding the Merger Agreement, the proposed
Merger and the other Transactions. You should carefully read this entire proxy statement/prospectus, including its Annexes and the
documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, because the information in this section may not provide all of
the information that might be important to you. Additional important information about ANGI Homeservices and Angie's List is contained
in the Annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference into, this proxy statement/prospectus. For a description of, and
instructions as to how to obtain, this information, see the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information."

Q: Why am I receiving this document? 

A: You are receiving this proxy statement/prospectus because you were a stockholder of record of Angie's List, Inc. ("Angie's List")
as of the close of business on August 25, 2017, which is the record date for the special meeting of Angie's List stockholders
described in this proxy statement/prospectus.

On May 1, 2017, Angie's List, IAC/InterActiveCorp ("IAC"), ANGI Homeservices Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of IAC
formerly known as Halo TopCo, Inc. ("ANGI Homeservices"), and Casa Merger Sub, Inc., a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
ANGI Homeservices ("Merger Sub"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, which was subsequently amended by an
Amendment No. 1 to the Agreement and Plan of Merger on August 26, 2017, and which is referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus as the "Merger Agreement." The Merger Agreement provides for the acquisition of Angie's List by ANGI
Homeservices by way of the merger of Merger Sub with and into Angie's List (the "Merger"), with Angie's List continuing as the
surviving company in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of ANGI Homeservices.

Angie's List is holding a special meeting of its stockholders, which is referred to herein as the "Angie's List special meeting," in
order to obtain the adoption of the Merger Agreement by its stockholders. Your vote is very important—we will be unable to
complete the Merger unless holders of a majority of the shares of Angie's List common stock outstanding as of the close of
business on the record date for the special meeting vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Angie's List
special meeting.

Q: What will happen in the Merger and what consideration will I receive in exchange for my shares of Angie's List common
stock? 

A: At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each share of Angie's List common stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares owned or held in treasury by Angie's List, which will automatically be cancelled, retired
and cease to exist for no consideration) will be converted into the right to receive, at the holder's election (i) in the case of a share
of Angie's List common stock with respect to which an election to receive a share of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of ANGI Homeservices (a "Class A share") has been properly made and not revoked or lost, one Class A share (the "Share
Consideration") or (ii) in the case of a share of Angie's List common stock with respect to which an election to receive cash has
been properly made and not revoked or lost, $8.50 in cash, without interest (the "Cash Consideration" which, together with the
Share Consideration, is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the "Merger Consideration"), but subject to the proration
provisions described in this proxy statement/prospectus. For more information regarding the procedures for electing between the
Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Election Procedures for the
Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration; Aggregate Cap and Possible Proration of the Cash Consideration."

Table of Contents

Q: Am I guaranteed to receive the form of consideration I elect to receive in the Merger? 

A: If you properly elect to receive the Share Consideration, yes. If you properly elect to receive the Cash Consideration, you are not
guaranteed to receive entirely Cash Consideration. Under the Merger Agreement, the aggregate Cash Consideration payable in the
Merger is capped at $130 million. Depending on the elections made by other Angie's List stockholders, the aggregate Cash
Consideration cap of $130 million may be exceeded in which case Angie's List stockholders who properly elected to receive Cash
Consideration in the Merger will receive a portion of their Merger Consideration in respect of the Angie's List shares for which the
Cash Consideration was properly elected in the form of the Share Consideration.

If the aggregate number of shares of Angie's List common stock in respect of which Cash Consideration is properly elected is less
than or equal to 15,294,118 shares (which is the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate Cash Consideration cap of
$130 million by $8.50, the per-share Cash Consideration amount), then (i) all shares of Angie's List common stock for which Cash
Consideration was properly elected will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and (ii) all other shares of
Angie's List common stock (other than shares owned or held in treasury by Angie's List, which will automatically be cancelled,
retired and cease to exist for no consideration) will be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration in the Merger,
including any shares of Angie's List common stock for which no election is properly made.

However, if the aggregate number of shares of Angie's List common stock in respect of which Cash Consideration is properly
elected exceeds 15,294,118 shares, then (i) all shares of Angie's List common stock for which Share Consideration was validly
elected will be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration and (ii) the number of shares of Angie's List common
stock of each stockholder of Angie's List who properly elected to receive Cash Consideration that will be converted into the right
to receive the Cash Consideration will be equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares for which such
Angie's List stockholder properly elected the Cash Consideration by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is 15,294,118, and the
denominator of which is the aggregate number of shares for which all Angie's List stockholders properly elected the Cash
Consideration, rounded to the nearest whole share. All other shares of Angie's List common stock (other than shares owned or held
in treasury by Angie's List, which will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist for no consideration) will be converted
into the right to receive the Share Consideration in the Merger, including any shares of Angie's List common stock for which no
election is properly made.

For more information, including an illustrative example of this proration procedure, see the section entitled "The Merger
Agreement—Election Procedures for the Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration; Aggregate Cap and Possible Proration
of the Cash Consideration."

Q: How do I elect the Cash Consideration or the Share Consideration? 

A: Angie's List will cause to be mailed or delivered an election form to each Angie's List stockholder as of the close of business on
August 25, 2017, which is the record date for the Angie's List special meeting. Angie's List will mail the election forms at least 20
business days prior to the anticipated election deadline. The election forms are expected to be mailed on or around August 30,
2017. Angie's List will also make available election forms as may be reasonably requested by anyone who becomes an Angie's List
stockholder after the record date for the Angie's List special meeting and prior to the election deadline. The deadline for returning
the election forms will be 5:00 p.m., Eastern time on September 28, 2017, the day prior to the date of the Angie's List special
meeting, unless another date is agreed in advance by Angie's List and IAC (in which case Angie's List will reasonably promptly
announce the rescheduled election deadline). An election will have been properly made only if the exchange agent has received, by
the election deadline, an election form

properly completed and signed and accompanied by (i) the Angie's List stock certificates, if any, to which such election form
relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of Angie's List, and (ii) in the case of
book-entry shares of Angie's List common stock, any additional documents specified in the procedures set forth in the election
form. See the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Election Procedures for the Share Consideration and the Cash
Consideration; Aggregate Cap and Possible Proration of the Cash Consideration."

Q: What happens if I do not submit a properly completed election form and related materials or they are not received by the
exchange agent before the election deadline? 

A: For any shares of Angie's List common stock with respect to which the exchange agent does not receive a properly completed and
timely election form and any related materials, the holder of those shares will be deemed not to have made an election. Under the
Merger Agreement, non-electing shares will be deemed to have elected to receive the Share Consideration, meaning each such
share of Angie's List common stock will be converted into one Class A share of ANGI Homeservices in the Merger. 

Q: Can I change or revoke an election for the Share Consideration or the Cash Consideration after it has been submitted? 

A: Any Angie's List stockholder may, at any time prior to the election deadline, change or revoke such stockholder's election by
written notice received by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline, accompanied by a properly completed and signed
revised election form, or by withdrawal prior to the election deadline of such stockholder's Angie's List stock certificates or any
documents in respect of book-entry shares of Angie's List previously deposited with the exchange agent. An election may not be
revoked after the election deadline. A revocation of an election prior to the election deadline is required in connection with any
transfer of shares of Angie's List common stock as to which an election has been properly made. As a result, following the election
deadline until the Closing, Angie's List stockholders will not be able to transfer (including by sale) any shares of Angie's List
common stock for which an election has been properly made. Any and all elections will be automatically deemed revoked upon
receipt by the exchange agent of written notice from Angie's List or IAC that the Merger Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms. 

Q: What is the Contribution? 

A: Prior to the closing of the Merger (the "Closing"), IAC will contribute its HomeAdvisor Business (as defined herein), along with
cash sufficient to fund the aggregate Cash Consideration, if any, to ANGI Homeservices in exchange for shares of Class B
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of ANGI Homeservices (the "Class B shares"). For further details regarding the
Contribution, see the section entitled "Ancillary Agreements—Contribution Agreement." 

Q: What is the HomeAdvisor Business and what is IAC? 

A: The HomeAdvisor Business is the operator of the largest global home services marketplace, connecting homeowners with service
professionals for home repair, maintenance and improvement projects. HomeAdvisor's marketplace provides the tools and
resources to allow homeowners to find local prescreened service professionals and instantly book appointments online or through
HomeAdvisor's award-winning mobile application. HomeAdvisor's marketplace also provides consumers with other home

(HomeStars), Germany (MyHammer), France (Travaux.com) and the Netherlands (Werkspot), as well as operations in Italy
(Instapro) and the United Kingdom (MyBuilder). The HomeAdvisor Business also operates Felix, a pay-per-call advertising
service, and mHelpDesk, a provider of cloud-based field service software for small to mid-size businesses.

As of June 30, 2017, the HomeAdvisor Business's network of service professionals in the United States consisted of approximately
164,000 paying professionals providing services in more than 500 categories ranging from simple home repairs to larger home
remodeling projects in more than 400 discrete geographies. The HomeAdvisor Business generated approximately 15.7 million
service requests from homeowners in the United States during the twelve months ended June 30, 2017.

For more information about the HomeAdvisor Business, see the sections entitled "Information About the HomeAdvisor Business"
and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the HomeAdvisor Business."

IAC (NASDAQ:IAC) is a leading media and internet company comprised of widely known consumer brands such as
HomeAdvisor, Vimeo, Dictionary.com, The Daily Beast, Investopedia and Match Group's online dating portfolio, which includes
Match, Tinder, PlentyOfFish and OkCupid. IAC is headquartered in New York City and has offices worldwide.

Q: What percentage of the combined company will holders of Angie's List common stock own following the completion of the
Merger? What percentage will IAC own? 

A: Immediately following the Closing, depending on the number of Angie's List stockholders that elect to receive Cash Consideration,
former holders of Angie's List common stock and equity awards are expected to hold, in the aggregate, Class A shares representing
between approximately 10% (assuming Angie's List stockholders elect to receive the maximum aggregate Cash Consideration) and
13% (assuming no Angie's List stockholders elect to receive Cash Consideration) of the economic interest in ANGI Homeservices
common stock (on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury stock method), and less than 2% of the total voting power of
ANGI Homeservices common stock, and IAC is expected to hold Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices which, together with
Class A shares underlying equity awards in respect of HomeAdvisor, Inc. ("HomeAdvisor (US)") to be converted into awards in
respect of ANGI Homeservices, will represent between approximately 87% and 90% of the economic interest (on a fully diluted
basis, calculated using the treasury stock method) and approximately 98% of the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices
common stock. For further details regarding the calculation of the number of Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices to be issued to
IAC prior to the Closing, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Determination of the Number of Class B Shares of
ANGI Homeservices to Be Issued to IAC."

There is no requirement for any Angie's List stockholder to receive Cash Consideration in the Merger. If no Angie's List
stockholder elects to receive the Cash Consideration, 100% of the consideration paid in the Merger will be in the form of Class A
shares of ANGI Homeservices (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares, if applicable).

Q: What will the corporate governance and management of ANGI Homeservices look like following the completion of the
Merger? 

A: Following the completion of the Merger, IAC will continue to control a majority of the voting power of the outstanding common
stock of ANGI Homeservices. As a result, ANGI Homeservices will be a "controlled company" under the applicable rules of the
NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ"). As a controlled company, ANGI Homeservices will be exempt from the obligation to
comply with certain corporate governance requirements under applicable NASDAQ Rules and

plans to take advantage of some or all of those exemptions, as further described in the section entitled "Corporate Governance of
ANGI Homeservices Following the Merger."

The Merger Agreement provides that the initial board of directors of ANGI Homeservices will consist of ten directors, with six
directors designated by IAC, two directors designated by IAC who qualify as "independent" pursuant to NASDAQ Rules and the
Exchange Act, and two directors selected by Angie's List from the Angie's List board of directors. The directors selected by
Angie's List will be Angela R. Hicks Bowman and Thomas R. Evans, if they continue to be able and willing to serve. The Merger
Agreement further provides that the chairman of the board of directors of ANGI Homeservices will be Joseph Levin, the current
Chief Executive Officer of IAC, and that the Chief Executive Officer of ANGI Homeservices will be Chris Terrill, the current
Chief Executive Officer of HomeAdvisor (US). For additional information regarding the expected directors and officers of ANGI
Homeservices, see the section entitled "Board of Directors and Executive Officers of ANGI Homeservices Following the Merger."

Q: When is the Merger expected to be completed? 

A: IAC and Angie's List expect the Closing to occur in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2017, subject to the adoption of
the Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the Merger. However,
no assurance can be provided as to when or if the Transactions will be completed. 

Q: What are the conditions to the completion of the Merger? 

A: The completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement.
These conditions include, among others, the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders at the special
meeting. For more information, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger."
Neither IAC nor Angie's List can be certain when or if the conditions to the Merger described above will be satisfied (or waived),
or that the Merger will be completed in a timely manner or at all. 

Q: What will happen if the Merger is not consummated? 

A: If the Merger and the other Transactions are not completed on a timely basis, or at all, the business, financial results and prospects
of Angie's List, as well as the market price of Angie's List common stock, may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of
the potential benefits of having completed the Transactions, Angie's List and its stockholders will be subject to a number of risks,
including the following: 

• Angie's List will be required to pay IAC a termination fee of $20 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated in
specified circumstances, as further described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Effects of Termination of the
Merger Agreement; Termination Fee and Expenses"; 

• time and resources spent or committed by Angie's List's management to matters relating to the Merger and the other
Transactions (including integration planning and expenses for professional services and other transaction costs, many of
which are payable by Angie's List regardless of whether or not the Merger and the other Transactions are consummated)
that could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities for Angie's List will have been largely
wasted; 

• negative publicity and a negative impression of Angie's List in the business community; and 

• if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Angie's List board of directors seeks an alternative business combination,
Angie's List stockholders cannot be certain that Angie's List

will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction agreement on terms equivalent to, or more attractive than, the
terms that IAC has agreed to in the Merger and the other Transactions.

Q: Will I be entitled to dissenters' rights or appraisal rights in the Merger? 

A: No. Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary
transaction, such as a merger, and demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a
judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with such extraordinary
transaction.

Appraisal rights are not available in all circumstances, and exceptions to these rights are provided under the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"). In the Merger, because Angie's List common stock is listed on NASDAQ, and because Angie's
List stockholders are not required to accept in the Merger any consideration in exchange for their shares of Angie's List common
stock other than Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices, which will be publicly listed on NASDAQ, and cash in lieu of fractional
shares (if applicable), holders of Angie's List common stock will not be entitled to any appraisal rights in connection with the
Merger with respect to their shares of Angie's List common stock. For a more detailed description of the relevant provisions of the
DGCL, see the section entitled "The Transactions—No Appraisal Rights."

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANGIE'S LIST SPECIAL MEETING 

        The following section provides brief answers to certain questions that you may have regarding the Angie's List special meeting of
stockholders to be held in connection with the Transactions. You should carefully read this entire proxy statement/prospectus, including its
Annexes and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, because the information in this section may
not provide all of the information that might be important to you. Additional important information about ANGI Homeservices and Angie's
List is contained in the Annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference into, this proxy statement/prospectus. For a description
of, and instructions as to how to obtain, this information, see the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information."

Q: How does the Angie's List board recommend that I vote at the special meeting? 

A: The board of directors of Angie's List, which is sometimes referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the "Angie's List
board," unanimously recommends that all Angie's List stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,
"FOR" the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation payable to certain executive officers of
Angie's List in connection with the Merger and "FOR" the proposal to approve the adjournment or postponement of the special
meeting if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement
if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement. See the sections entitled "The
Transactions—Joint Reasons of Angie's List and IAC for the Transactions" and "—Angie's List's Reasons for the Transactions;
Recommendation of the Angie's List Board of Directors." 

Q: Who can vote at the special meeting? 

A: Only holders of record of Angie's List common stock as of the close of business on the record date of August 25, 2017, which is
referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the "record date," are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the special
meeting. Each outstanding share of Angie's List common stock held as of the close of business on the record date entitles its holder
to cast one vote on each proposal to be voted on at the special meeting. 

Q: When and where is the special meeting? 

A: The special meeting will be held on September 29, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time, at The Alexander, 333 S. Delaware St., Indianapolis,
Indiana 46204. Angie's List stockholders as of the close of business on the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend
the special meeting. If you hold shares of Angie's List common stock in your name as a stockholder of record and you wish to
attend the special meeting, you must present evidence of your stock ownership, such as your most recent account statement, at the
special meeting. You should also bring valid picture identification. If your shares of Angie's List common stock are held in "street
name" in a stock brokerage account or otherwise by a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to attend the special
meeting, you need to bring a copy of a bank or brokerage statement to the special meeting reflecting your stock ownership as of the
record date. You should also bring valid picture identification. Please note that if your shares of Angie's List common stock are
held by a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and you plan to attend the special meeting in person and would like to vote at the
special meeting, you will need to bring a legal proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee as further described in this
proxy statement/prospectus. For additional information about the special meeting, see the section entitled "Angie's List Special
Meeting of Stockholders."

Table of Contents

Q: What am I being asked to vote on at the special meeting? 

A: You are being asked to consider and vote upon (i) a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, (ii) a proposal to approve, on an
advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation payable to certain executive officers of Angie's List in connection with the Merger
and (iii) a proposal to approve the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting if necessary or appropriate, including to
solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the
special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement. 

Q: Why am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation
payable to certain executive officers of Angie's List in connection with the Merger? 

A: Under SEC rules, Angie's List is required to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote with respect to the compensation that may be paid
or become payable to its named executive officers that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger. 

Q: What will happen if Angie's List stockholders do not approve this Merger-related compensation? 

A: Approval by Angie's List stockholders of the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Angie's List's named executive
officers that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the Merger is not a condition to completion of the Merger. The vote is an advisory
vote and will not be binding on Angie's List, the surviving corporation in the Merger, ANGI Homeservices or any other party. If
the Merger is completed, the Merger-related compensation may be paid to Angie's List's named executive officers to the extent
payable in accordance with the terms of their compensation agreements and arrangements, even if Angie's List stockholders do not
approve, by advisory (non-binding) vote, the Merger-related compensation. 

Q: What is the vote required to approve each proposal at the Angie's List special meeting? 

A: Adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Angie's List common
stock outstanding and entitled to vote on this proposal. Accordingly, your failure to submit a proxy card or to vote in person at the
special meeting, your abstention from voting or your failure to give voting instructions to your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee if you hold your shares in "street name" through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, will have the same effect as a
vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

Approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the compensation payable to certain executive officers of Angie's List in
connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Angie's List common stock
present, in person or represented by proxy, at the special meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal. If your shares are not in
attendance at the special meeting, they will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal; however, if a quorum is present and
you submit a proxy or vote in person at the special meeting and indicate "ABSTAIN," your abstention will have the same effect as
a vote "AGAINST" this proposal.

Approval of the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting if it is necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional
proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to
adopt the Merger Agreement, requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Angie's List common stock
present, in person or represented by proxy, at the special meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal. If your shares are not in
attendance at the special meeting, they will have no effect on the outcome of any vote to adjourn or postpone the special meeting;
however, if a

Table of Contents

quorum is present and you submit a proxy or vote in person at the special meeting and indicate "ABSTAIN," your abstention will
have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" this proposal.

See the sections entitled, "Angie's List Special Meeting of Stockholders—Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote," "—
Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes" and "—Required Vote."

Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 

A: If your shares of Angie's List common stock are registered directly in your name with the transfer agent of Angie's List,
Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As the stockholder
of record, you have the right to vote or to grant a proxy for your vote directly to Angie's List or to a third party to vote at the
special meeting.

If your shares are held by a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in
"street name," and your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee is considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares.
Your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee will send you, as the beneficial owner, a package describing the procedure for voting
your shares. You should follow the instructions provided by them to vote your shares. You are invited to attend the special meeting;
however, you may not vote these shares in person at the special meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares at the special meeting.

Q: If my shares of Angie's List common stock are held in "street name" by my bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, will
my bank, brokerage firm or other nominee automatically vote those shares for me? 

A: Your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of Angie's List common stock if you
instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee regarding the voting of your shares of Angie's List common stock. Under the rules that govern
brokers who have record ownership of shares that are held in "street name" for their clients, the beneficial owners of the shares,
brokers have discretion to vote these shares on routine matters but not on non-routine matters. The proposals to be voted on at the
special meeting are not considered routine matters. Accordingly, brokers will not have discretionary voting authority to vote on the
matters at the special meeting and, without instruction from the beneficial owner of the shares of Angie's List common stock held
by that broker, will not be permitted to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the proposal to approve, on an
advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation payable to certain executive officers of Angie's List in connection with the Merger
or the proposal to adjourn or postpone the special meeting if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in
favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the
Merger Agreement. Accordingly, shares of Angie's List common stock beneficially owned that have been designated on proxy
cards by the broker (or bank or other nominee) as not voted on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, which are referred to
in this proxy statement/prospectus as "broker non-votes," will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement and to the extent a broker (or bank or other nominee) has caused your shares to be represented at the special
meeting, the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation payable to certain executive officers of
Angie's List in connection with the Merger. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the proposal to approve one or more
adjournments or postponements of the special meeting.

Table of Contents

Q: How many votes do I have? 

A: Each outstanding share of Angie's List common stock held as of the close of business on the record date entitles its holder to cast
one vote on each proposal to be voted on at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record date, there were
61,292,181 shares of Angie's List common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting. 

Q: What constitutes a quorum for the special meeting? 

A: The presence, in person or represented by proxy, of a majority of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock entitled to
vote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum at the meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present and
entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. 

Q: How do I vote? 

A: Stockholder of Record.    If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote using any of the following methods:

nominee to see which of the above choices are available to you. Please note that if you are a beneficial owner and wish to vote in
person at the special meeting you must obtain a legal proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and present it to the
inspectors of election with your ballot.

Q: How can I change or revoke my vote? 

A: You have the right to revoke a proxy, whether delivered by telephone, over the internet or by mail, at any time before it is voted at
the special meeting, by voting again at a later date through any of the methods available to you, by attending the special meeting
and voting in person, or by giving written notice of revocation to Angie's List prior to the time the special meeting begins. Written
notice of revocation should be mailed to: Angie's List, Inc., Attention: Corporate Secretary, 1030 East Washington Street,
Indianapolis, Indiana 46202. If your shares are held in "street name," you must contact your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee

A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will vote your shares of Angie's
List common stock in the way that you indicate. When completing the telephone or internet processes or the proxy card, you may
specify whether your shares of Angie's List common stock should be voted for or against or to abstain from voting on all, some or
none of the specific items of business to come before the special meeting.

If you are an Angie's List stockholder of record and you sign, date and return your proxy card but do not indicate how you want to
vote or do not indicate that you wish to abstain, your shares will be voted (i) "FOR" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,
(ii) "FOR" the proposal to approve compensation payable to certain executive officers of Angie's List in connection with the
Merger, (iii) "FOR" the proposal to adjourn or postpone the special meeting if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special
meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement and (iv) in the discretion of the proxyholders on any other matter that may properly come
before the special meeting at the discretion of the Angie's List board of directors.

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials? 

A: If you hold shares of Angie's List common stock in "street name" and also directly as a record holder or otherwise or if you hold
shares of Angie's List common stock in more than one brokerage account, you may receive more than one set of voting materials
relating to the special meeting. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card (or cast your vote by telephone or internet as
provided on your proxy card) or otherwise follow the voting instructions provided in this proxy statement/prospectus in order to
ensure that all of your shares of Angie's List common stock are voted. If you hold your shares in "street name" through a bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee, you should follow the procedures provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to
vote your shares. 

Q: What happens if I sell my shares of Angie's List common stock before the special meeting? 

A: The record date is earlier than both the date of the special meeting and the Effective Time of the Merger. If you transfer your shares
of Angie's List common stock after the record date but before the special meeting, you will, unless the transferee requests a proxy
from you, retain your right to vote at the special meeting but will transfer the right to receive the Share Consideration or Cash
Consideration, as applicable, to the person to whom you transfer your shares. In order to receive the Share Consideration or Cash
Consideration, as applicable, you must hold your shares through the Effective Time of the Merger. 

Q: Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies? 

A: Angie's List is soliciting proxies for the special meeting from Angie's List stockholders. Angie's List has also retained Innisfree
M&A Incorporated to solicit proxies for the special meeting from Angie's List stockholders for a fee of approximately $20,000,
plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Angie's List will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from Angie's List stockholders,
and Angie's List will pay all expenses incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of this proxy statement/prospectus. In
addition to this mailing, Angie's List's directors, officers and employees (who will not receive any additional compensation for
such services) may solicit proxies. Solicitation of proxies may be undertaken through the mail, in person, by telephone, the internet

for forwarding proxy materials to the beneficial owners of Angie's List common stock and in obtaining voting instructions from
such beneficial owners.

IAC is expected to hold Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices which, together with Class A shares underlying equity awards in
respect of HomeAdvisor (US) to be converted into awards in respect of ANGI Homeservices, will represent between approximately
87% and 90% of the economic interest (on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury stock method) and approximately 98%
of the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices common stock.

The Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration (Page 124)

        At the effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"), each share of Angie's List common stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares owned or held in treasury by Angie's List, which will automatically be cancelled,
retired and cease to exist for no consideration) will be converted into the right to receive, at the holder's election (i) in the case of a
share of Angie's List common stock with respect to which an election to receive a Class A share of ANGI Homeservices has been
properly made and not revoked or lost, one Class A share (the "Share Consideration") or (ii) in the case of a share of Angie's List
common stock with respect to which an election to receive cash has been properly made and not revoked or lost, $8.50 in cash,
without interest (the "Cash Consideration" which, together with the Share Consideration, is referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus as the "Merger Consideration"), but subject to the consideration election procedures and Cash Consideration
proration provisions described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Election Procedures for the Share Consideration and
the Cash Consideration; Aggregate Cap and Possible Proration of the Cash Consideration."

        There is no requirement for any Angie's List stockholder to receive Cash Consideration in the Merger. If no Angie's List
stockholder elects to receive the Cash Consideration, 100% of the consideration paid in the Merger will be in the form of Class A
shares of ANGI Homeservices (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares, if applicable).

Treatment of Angie's List Equity Awards in the Merger (Page 125)

        Options.    Each option to purchase shares of Angie's List common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will, as of the Effective Time, be converted into an option to purchase (i) that number of Class A shares of ANGI
Homeservices equal to the total number of shares of Angie's List common stock subject to such Angie's List option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) at a per-share exercise price equal to the exercise price per share of Angie's List common stock at
which such Angie's List option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each ANGI Homeservices option will
otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as applied to the corresponding Angie's List option
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        Restricted Stock Unit Awards.    Each award of restricted stock units that corresponds to shares of Angie's List common stock
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, as of the Effective Time, be converted into an ANGI Homeservices
restricted stock unit award with respect to a number of Class A shares equal to the number of shares of Angie's List common stock
subject to such restricted stock unit award immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming satisfaction of any applicable
performance goals at the target performance level with respect to Angie's List performance-based restricted stock unit awards
granted in June 2016). Each ANGI Homeservices restricted stock unit award will otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions (including vesting) as applied to the corresponding Angie's List restricted stock unit award immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that ANGI Homeservices restricted stock unit awards corresponding to performance-based Angie's List
restricted stock unit awards granted in June 2016 will vest solely on the basis of service following the Effective Time.

Joint Reasons of Angie's List and IAC for the Transactions (Page 84)

        IAC and Angie's List (which, for purposes of this section, are sometimes referred to as "we" and "our") believe that the
combination of the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List pursuant to the Transactions will enhance stockholder value by, among
other things, enabling the combined company, ANGI Homeservices, to capitalize on the market opportunity presented by the
following dynamics of the home services market:

• Large and growing addressable market:  The U.S. home services market is large and growing, with an estimated
total value in excess of $400 billion in 2017, and an expected compound annual growth rate of approximately 6%
over the next five years, according to Cowen and Company. As the operator of the largest global home services
marketplace, we believe ANGI Homeservices will be well positioned to capitalize on this growing market. 

• Fragmented two-sided marketplace:  The home services market is also highly fragmented on both the consumer and
service professional sides of the marketplace. We believe this substantial fragmentation means that both consumers
and service professionals experience significant friction when trying to transact, which creates an opportunity for a
technology-driven marketplace to provide a superior solution. We believe a solutions provider such as ANGI
Homeservices can provide enduring value to its service professional customers and to homeowners by reducing
friction, increasing total transaction volume, enabling more satisfying experiences and delivering improved returns
(whether measured by time spent searching or dollars spent marketing) to marketplace participants. 

• Accelerating online migration:  The home services market is one of the largest remaining marketplaces where digital
penetration remains low. We expect the migration to online marketplaces for finding and booking home services to
accelerate in the future due to many factors.

        We believe that the combined company will be better positioned than either Angie's List or the HomeAdvisor Business would
be on a standalone basis to capitalize on these dynamics of the home services market due to the substantial strategic and financial
benefits that we believe will result from the Transactions. We believe these benefits include:

• Network effects of the combination:  We believe that combining Angie's List, which has the industry's leading brand
(according to a brand measurement study conducted by the HomeAdvisor Business) and significant recurring
organic traffic (with an estimated 13.0 million monthly unique visitors to its platform (on average, for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2017, measured by daily unique visitors, according to web analytics company Omniture)),
with the HomeAdvisor Business, which we believe has the nation's largest online network of service professionals
(with approximately 164,000 paying professionals in its network as of June 30, 2017), will create a more
comprehensive, liquid and efficient marketplace. 

• Diversifying the monetization model:  We believe that ANGI Homeservices will have best-in-class monetization
capabilities, spanning a variety of monetization methods, and offering choice to service professionals and consumers
alike. 

• Enhancing innovation:  We expect that, by combining the resources of the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List,
ANGI Homeservices will be able to accelerate the product innovation that is fundamental to removing friction in
order to drive home services customers and service professionals online. We believe that the increased reach, scale
and resources of ANGI Homeservices will facilitate continued product innovation in the rapidly growing digital
home services market, leading to the potential for long-term revenue and earnings growth, as well as improved
consumer satisfaction.

Table of Contents

• Improving customer and service professional acquisition efficiency:  We believe the combined company will use
shared best practices and data to deliver market-leading customer acquisition efficiency. 

• Achieving substantial synergies:  We believe that the Transactions will create significant synergies across the
combined company in three major categories: (i) cost savings that result from the streamlining of duplicative
resources or the refocusing of such otherwise duplicative resources toward growth initiatives; (ii) enhanced
monetization of the Angie's List consumer traffic by application of the HomeAdvisor business model; and
(iii) efficiencies and conversion improvements resulting from the increased scale of the combined company,
including in the areas of sales, marketing and technology. 

• Blending compatible cultures and service philosophies:  ANGI Homeservices will have a highly experienced
management team assembled from both companies, and a board of directors comprised of representatives of both
IAC and the current board of directors of Angie's List. We believe that the industry expertise of management,
coupled with the continuity in management oversight in the combined company's board, will provide a deep
understanding of the best practices of both companies that will facilitate successful integration of the HomeAdvisor
Business and Angie's List.

Angie's List's Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the Angie's List Board of Directors (Page 87)

        The Angie's List board of directors believes that the businesses of Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business are
complementary and that a combination of Angie's List with the HomeAdvisor Business presents a compelling strategic opportunity
to enhance value for Angie's List stockholders. In evaluating the Transactions, the Angie's List board of directors consulted with
Angie's List's management and legal and financial advisors.

        In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and recommend the adoption of the Merger Agreement to Angie's
List's stockholders, the Angie's List board of directors considered a number of factors and a number of potential risks, including,
among others, the fact that there is no trading history for ANGI Homeservices equity securities or any equity securities of any of the
HomeAdvisor Entities, and that therefore there would be substantial uncertainty regarding the prices at which the Class A shares to
be received by Angie's List stockholders who receive the Share Consideration in the Merger may trade following the Merger.
Certain of the additional factors and potential risks the Angie's List board of directors considered are discussed in more detail under
"The Transactions—Joint Reasons of Angie's List and IAC for the Transactions" and "—Angie's List's Reasons for the
Transactions; Recommendation of the Angie's List Board of Directors."

Opinions of Angie's List's Financial Advisors (Page 90)

directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, of the Merger Consideration to be

Angie's List to proceed with or effect the Merger or related transactions. BofA Merrill Lynch also expressed no opinion or
recommendation as to any election made by a stockholder or how any stockholder should vote or act in connection with the
Merger, any related transactions or any other matter.

Corporate Governance, Board of Directors and Management of ANGI Homeservices Following the Merger (Page 190)

        Following the completion of the Merger, IAC will continue to control a majority of the voting power of the outstanding
common stock of ANGI Homeservices. As a result, ANGI Homeservices will be a "controlled company" under the applicable rules
of NASDAQ. As a controlled company, ANGI Homeservices will be exempt from the obligation to comply with certain corporate
governance requirements under applicable NASDAQ Rules and plans to take advantage of some or all of those exemptions, as
further described in the section entitled "Corporate Governance of ANGI Homeservices Following the Merger."

        The Merger Agreement provides that the initial board of directors of ANGI Homeservices will consist of ten directors, with six
directors designated by IAC, two directors designated by IAC who qualify as "independent" pursuant to NASDAQ Rules and the
Exchange Act, and two directors selected by Angie's List from the Angie's List board of directors. The directors selected by Angie's
List will be Angela R. Hicks Bowman and Thomas R. Evans, if they continue to be able and willing to serve. The Merger
Agreement further provides that the chairman of the board of directors of ANGI Homeservices will be Joseph Levin, the current
Chief Executive Officer of IAC, and that the Chief Executive Officer of ANGI Homeservices will be Chris Terrill, the current Chief
Executive Officer of

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (Page 113)

        Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") and the rules promulgated
thereunder, the Merger may not be completed until notifications have been given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division
of the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and all statutory waiting period
requirements have been satisfied. Completion of the Merger is subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act. Pursuant to the HSR Act, IAC filed its Notification and Report Form with the FTC and the DOJ on
May 11, 2017. Angie's List filed its Notification and Report Form with the FTC and DOJ on May 15, 2017. On June 14, 2017, to
give additional time to the DOJ to review the transaction during its initial review period and thus expedite the DOJ's overall review
of the transaction, IAC withdrew its Notification and Report Form and re-filed it on June 15, 2017. The applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act was terminated early by the FTC effective as of July 13, 2017.

Restrictions on Solicitation of Alternative Takeover Proposals by Angie's List (Page 136)

        Except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement, Angie's List has agreed that it will not, and will cause each of its
affiliates and each of its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, financial advisors, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other representatives not to, among other things, (i) directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage any inquiries regarding, or the making, submission or announcement by any person of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a "Company Takeover Proposal" (as defined in the section entitled "The
Merger Agreement—No Solicitation by Angie's List of Alternative Takeover Proposals") or (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding a Company Takeover Proposal, or furnish to any other person (other than
IAC and its representatives) any information relating to Angie's List or any of its subsidiaries, or afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of Angie's List or any of its subsidiaries to any person (other than IAC and its representatives),
in each case in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating a Company Takeover Proposal (other than to refer
the inquiring person to the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement).

        However, notwithstanding the restrictions described above, if at any time from and after May 1, 2017 and prior to the adoption
of the Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders (but not after), (i) Angie's List receives a bona fide, unsolicited written
Company Takeover Proposal from any person that did not result from, directly or indirectly, a breach of the non-solicitation
provisions of the Merger

Agreement and (ii) the Angie's List board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a "Superior
Proposal" (as defined in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation by Angie's List of Alternative Takeover
Proposals") and, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then Angie's List may, subject to specified procedures, furnish
information with respect to Angie's List and its subsidiaries, and afford access to the business, properties, assets, employees,
officers, contracts, books and records of Angie's List and its subsidiaries, to the person that made such Company Takeover Proposal
and its representatives, and engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Company
Takeover Proposal and its representatives regarding such Company Takeover Proposal.

Change in the Angie's List Board Recommendation (Page 139)

        As further described in the sections entitled "The Transactions—Joint Reasons of Angie's List and IAC for the Transactions"
and "—Angie's List's Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the Angie's List Board of Directors," and subject to the
provisions described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Change in the Angie's List Board Recommendation," the
Angie's List board of directors recommends that Angie's List stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, which recommendation is referred to in this section as the "Angie's List board recommendation."

        Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Angie's List has agreed that its board of directors will not, among other things, fail
to include the Angie's List board recommendation in this proxy statement/prospectus, change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to IAC, the Angie's
List board recommendation, or fail to recommend against any Company Takeover Proposal or fail to reaffirm the Angie's List board
recommendation within five business days after a request by IAC to do so, subject to certain exceptions and limitations.

        However, notwithstanding the restrictions on changes to the Angie's List board recommendation described above, at any time
prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders, the Angie's List board of directors may make an
adverse recommendation change with respect to a Superior Proposal and/or cause Angie's List to terminate the Merger Agreement
(which will require concurrent payment of the termination fee to IAC as described below) in order to enter into a definitive
agreement providing for the consummation of the transaction contemplated by such Superior Proposal, in either case if, subject to
certain restrictions, after receiving a bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from, directly or
indirectly, a breach of the non-solicitation provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Angie's List board of directors has
determined in good faith (i) after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (ii) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, in light of such
Company Takeover Proposal, that the failure to make such an adverse recommendation change or terminate the Merger Agreement
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Angie's List board of directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        Additionally, notwithstanding the restrictions on changes to the Angie's List board recommendation described above, the
Angie's List board of directors may make an adverse recommendation change in response to an Intervening Event (as defined in the
section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Change in the Angie's List Board Recommendation") if the Angie's List board of
directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that its failure

to make an adverse recommendation change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        Prior to making any adverse recommendation change or terminating the Merger Agreement as described above, Angie's List
must comply with specified procedures to provide notice of the pending change to IAC, and to negotiate in good faith with IAC
during a specified period prior to making any such change, as further described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—
Change in the Angie's List Board Recommendation."

Termination of the Merger Agreement (Page 146)

        Angie's List and IAC may mutually agree to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time prior to the completion of the Merger
(including after the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders).

        In addition, either IAC or Angie's List may terminate the Merger Agreement if:

• the Merger is not consummated on or prior to February 1, 2018 (provided that this right to terminate will not be
available to a party if the failure of the Closing to occur by such date was due to a material breach of the Merger
Agreement by such party); 

• an injunction or other order is entered by a court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and
such injunction or other order has become final and nonappealable (provided that this right to terminate will not be
available to a party if the injunction was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations
under the Merger Agreement); 

• the Angie's List special meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) has concluded without the
adoption of Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders; or 

• the other party (as referring to IAC in this bullet point, "the other party" also includes ANGI Homeservices and
Merger Sub) has breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in the Merger Agreement, and such breach or failure to perform (i) if it occurred on or continued to occur
on the Closing Date, would result in a failure of a condition to the Closing to be satisfied by such breaching party,
and (ii) is incapable of being cured by February 1, 2018 or, if curable by such date, is not cured within 20 business
days of receipt of written notice from the other party (provided that this right to terminate will not be available to a
party if such party is then in material breach of the Merger Agreement and such breach would result in a failure of a
condition to the Closing to be satisfied by such party).

        IAC may also terminate the Merger Agreement prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders if
the Angie's List board of directors makes an adverse recommendation change, as further described in the section entitled "The
Merger Agreement—Change in the Angie's List Board Recommendation."

        Angie's List may also terminate the Merger Agreement prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by its stockholders in
order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, as further described in the section entitled "The Merger
Agreement—No Solicitation by Angie's List of Alternative Takeover Proposals" (but only if Angie's List enters into such definitive
agreement concurrently with the termination of the Merger Agreement and pays the termination fee described below).

Termination Fee (Page 147)

        Angie's List will be obligated to pay IAC a termination fee of $20 million in any of the following circumstances:

• if Angie's List terminates the Merger Agreement prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by its stockholders
in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal; 

• if IAC terminates the Merger Agreement prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders
because the Angie's List board of directors makes an adverse recommendation change; or 

• if a Company Takeover Proposal (as defined in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation by
Angie's List of Alternative Takeover Proposals," except that all references to "15%" in that definition will be deemed
references to "50%" for purposes of this termination fee trigger) has been made or communicated to the Angie's List
board of directors or has been publicly announced or become publicly known and: 

• such Company Takeover Proposal has not been publicly withdrawn at least five business days prior to the
Angie's List special meeting, and the Merger Agreement is later terminated because the Angie's List special
meeting concludes without the adoption of Merger Agreement proposal by Angie's List stockholders; or 

• such Company Takeover Proposal has not been withdrawn prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement
due to (a) the Merger having not been consummated by February 1, 2018 or (b) Angie's List having breached
or failed to perform under the Merger Agreement in a manner that causes the closing condition relating to the
performance by Angie's List of its obligations under the Merger Agreement in all material respects not to be
satisfied; and 

• in either of the cases described in the preceding two bullet points, within nine months of such termination,
Angie's List or any of its subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with a third party with respect to, or
consummates a transaction that is, a Company Takeover Proposal with a third party (or a third party
otherwise consummates a transaction that is a Company Takeover Proposal).

        For additional details, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Effects of Termination of the Merger Agreement;
Termination Fee and Expenses."

Accounting Treatment of the Merger (Page 115)

        ANGI Homeservices will account for the acquisition of Angie's List pursuant to the Merger using the acquisition method of
accounting in accordance with GAAP. ANGI Homeservices will measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair
values, including net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as of the Closing. Any excess of
the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill.

        Definite lived intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
and goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually. All intangible assets and goodwill are also
tested for impairment when certain indicators are present, which may occur more frequently than on an annual basis.

        The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed reflected in the unaudited pro forma
combined financial statements (see the section entitled "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information") is
based on preliminary estimates using assumptions that the management of ANGI Homeservices believes are reasonable based on
currently available

liabilities will be completed following the Closing based in part on a detailed analysis that has not yet been completed.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 157)

        It is intended that either (i) the Merger qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") or, (ii) the Merger, when combined with the Contribution and the IAC Share
Issuance, qualify as an exchange described in Section 351(a) of the Code. It is a condition to the obligation of Angie's List to effect
the Merger that Angie's List receive a written opinion from its counsel, Sidley Austin, to the effect that either (i) the Merger will
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) the Merger, when combined with the
Contribution and the IAC Share Issuance, will qualify as an exchange described in Section 351(a) of the Code. Accordingly,
assuming the receipt and accuracy of such opinion, the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders (as defined in
the section entitled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger") of Angie's List common stock generally are
as follows:

• If a U.S. holder receives solely shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock in exchange for its shares of
Angie's List common stock, such holder generally will not recognize any gain or loss, except with respect to cash
received in lieu of fractional shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock. 

• If a U.S. holder receives solely cash in exchange for its shares of Angie's List common stock, such holder generally
will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received and such holder's adjusted
tax basis in such Angie's List shares. 

• If a U.S. holder receives a combination of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock and cash in exchange for its
shares of Angie's List common stock, such holder generally will recognize gain (but not loss) in an amount equal to
the lesser of (i) the amount by which the sum of the fair market value of the ANGI Homeservices Class A common
stock and cash received by such holder exceeds such holder's adjusted tax basis in its shares of Angie's List common
stock surrendered and (ii) the amount of cash received by such holder.

        Holders of Angie's List common stock should read the section entitled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger" for a more complete discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger, including the discussion
applicable to holders of Angie's List common stock that acquired blocks of Angie's List common stock at different times or different
prices. Holders of Angie's List common stock should consult their own tax advisors to determine the specific consequences to them
of exchanging their shares of Angie's List common stock pursuant to the Merger.

Angie's List Special Meeting of Stockholders (Page 58)

        The Angie's List special meeting will be held on September 29, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time, at The Alexander, 333 S. Delaware
St., Indianapolis, Indiana 46204. Holders of record of Angie's List common stock as of the close of business on the record date of
August 25, 2017, which is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the "record date," are entitled to receive notice of, and to
vote at, the special meeting. Each outstanding share of Angie's List common stock held as of the close of business on the record date
entitles its holder to cast one vote on each proposal to be voted on at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the record
date, there were 61,292,181 shares of Angie's List common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.

        At the special meeting, Angie's List stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon (i) a proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement, (ii) a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding)

basis, the compensation payable to certain executive officers of Angie's List in connection with the Merger and (iii) a proposal to
approve the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies
in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt
the Merger Agreement.

        Adoption of the Merger Agreement, which is a condition to the completion of the Merger, requires the affirmative vote of
holders of a majority of the shares of Angie's List common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on this proposal. Accordingly,
your failure to submit a proxy card or to vote in person at the special meeting, your abstention from voting or your failure to give
voting instructions to your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee if you hold your shares in "street name" through a bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee, will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

        For additional information about the special meeting, see the section entitled "Angie's List Special Meeting of Stockholders."

Ownership of Angie's List Common Stock by Angie's List Directors, Executive Officers and Their Affiliates (Page 279)

        As of the close of business on the record date, Angie's List's directors, executive officers and their respective affiliates owned
and were entitled to vote 7,436,575 shares of Angie's List common stock. This represents approximately 12% of the outstanding
shares of Angie's List common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Completion of the Merger is conditioned upon, among
other things, the adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders of Angie's List. Adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the
affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Angie's List common stock. Angie's List currently expects that
the Angie's List directors and executive officers will vote their shares of Angie's List common stock in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement and the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although none of them is obligated to
do so.

Interests of Angie's List's Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions (Page 116)

        In considering whether to approve the proposals set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus to be voted on at the Angie's List
special meeting, including the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should recognize that some of the members of
management and of the Angie's List board of directors may have interests in the Transactions that differ from, or are in addition to,
their interests as Angie's List stockholders. These interests include:

• the rights of some executive officers to receive payments or other benefits, including the conversion of certain stock
options and restricted stock unit awards, acceleration of the vesting of certain equity awards, and possible payments
due upon certain terminations of employment during a specified period prior to or following a change in control; 

• the expected service of Angela R. Hicks Bowman and Thomas R. Evans as directors of ANGI Homeservices
following the Merger; 

• an employment agreement entered into between ANGI Homeservices and Ms. Hicks Bowman providing for her
continued service to ANGI Homeservices following the Closing; and 

• the continued indemnification of Angie's List's directors and officers after the completion of the Transactions for acts
or omissions that occurred in their capacity as directors or officers prior to the Closing.

Table of Contents

Homeservices are both organized under the laws of Delaware. However, differences in the rights of holders of Angie's List common
stock and holders of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices will arise due to differences between their respective certificates of
incorporation and bylaws. These differences will include, among other things, differences with respect to the number and types of
authorized capital stock and the voting and other rights of the different classes, dividends and distributions, the structure of the
board of directors, the removal of directors, the ability of stockholders to act by written consent, future amendments to the
organizational documents, and the renunciation of corporate opportunities. For more information, see the sections entitled
"Description of ANGI Homeservices Capital Stock" and "Comparison of the Rights of Angie's List Stockholders and Holders of
Class A Shares of ANGI Homeservices."

Listing of Class A Shares of ANGI Homeservices (Page 114)

        It is currently expected that following the Closing, Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices will trade on NASDAQ under the
symbol "ANGI." The approval for listing of the Class A shares is a condition to the Closing, as discussed in the section entitled
"The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger."

No Appraisal Rights (Page 115)

        Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary
transaction, such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a
judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction.
Under Delaware law, holders of Angie's List common stock are not entitled to any appraisal rights in connection with the
Transactions.

Risk Factors (Page 33)

        In deciding how to vote your shares of Angie's List common stock at the special meeting, and in deciding whether to elect to
receive the Share Consideration or the Cash Consideration (or a combination of the two) in the Merger, you should read carefully
this entire proxy statement/prospectus, including the Annexes and the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement/prospectus, and in particular, you should read the section entitled "Risk Factors."

Litigation Related to the Merger (Page 122)

        On July 18, 2017, a putative class action complaint, captioned Parshall v. Angie's List,  Inc., C.A. No. 1:17-cv-02418 (the
"Parshall Action"), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana in connection with the Merger. On
July 20, 2017, a similar class action lawsuit was filed in the same court, captioned Pill v. Angie's List, Inc., C.A. No. 1:17-cv-02461
(the "Pill Action") (together, the two actions are referred to as the "Actions"). The complaints in both the Parshall Action and the
Pill Action named as defendants IAC, ANGI Homeservices, Merger Sub, Angie's List and the members of the Angie's List board of
directors.

        The complaints in the Actions allege that Angie's List, the members of the Angie's List board of directors, IAC, ANGI
Homeservices and Merger Sub allegedly omitted and/or misrepresented certain information in the registration statement on Form S-
4 of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part in violation of the Exchange Act and related SEC regulations. The alleged
omissions and/or misrepresentations generally relate to (i) certain of Angie's List's and the HomeAdvisor Business's financial
projections, (ii) certain data and inputs underlying the financial analyses, (iii) certain interests of Angie's List's directors and
executive officers in the Transactions, and (iv) the background of the Transactions.

        The Actions collectively seek the following relief: (i) ordering that the Actions be maintained as a class action and certifying
the plaintiffs as the class representative and the plaintiff's counsel as class counsel, (ii) preliminarily and permanently enjoining the
defendants and all persons acting in concert with them from proceeding with, consummating or closing the Transactions,
(iii) directing the Angie's List board of directors to disseminate a Form S-4 that does not contain any untrue statements of material
fact and that states all material facts required in it or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading, (iv) in the
event the defendants consummate the Transactions, rescinding them and setting them aside or awarding rescissory damages to the
plaintiffs and the class, (v) declaring that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as Rule 14a-9
promulgated thereunder, and/or Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, (vi) directing the defendants to account to the plaintiffs and the
class for damages sustained, (vii) awarding the plaintiffs the costs of the Actions, including reasonable allowance for plaintiffs'
attorneys and experts' fees, and (viii) granting such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper.

        The defendants consider the claims asserted to be without merit.

Homeservices Class A shares and Angie's List common stock, and other matters. Statements in this proxy statement/prospectus, including
the documents incorporated by reference, that are not historical facts are hereby identified as "forward-looking statements" for the purpose
of the safe harbor provided by Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. These forward-looking statements,
including, without limitation, those relating to the future business prospects, revenues and income of ANGI Homeservices, the
HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List, wherever they occur in this proxy statement/prospectus, are necessarily estimates reflecting the

suggested by these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements should therefore be considered in light of various
important factors, including those expressly set forth in or incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.

materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements include, among others, risks and uncertainties relating to the
following:

• the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the proposed Transactions are not realized as expected or at all, including as a
result of the impact of, or problems arising from, the integration of the HomeAdvisor Business and the business of Angie's
List or as a result of changes in the economy and competitive factors in the areas where the HomeAdvisor Business and
Angie's List do business; 

• the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to right of one or both of Angie's List and
IAC to terminate the Merger Agreement; 

• the failure of Angie's List stockholders to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Angie's List special meeting, or the failure to
satisfy any of the other conditions to the proposed Transactions on a timely basis or at all; 

• the possibility that the proposed Transactions may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, including as a result of
unexpected factors or events; 

• diversion of the attention of the management of Angie's List or the HomeAdvisor Business from ongoing business
operations and opportunities in connection with the Transactions; 

• potential adverse reactions or changes to business or employee relationships, including those resulting from the
announcement or completion of the Transactions; 

• potential changes to tax legislation; 

• the ability of the HomeAdvisor Business or Angie's List to retain key personnel; and

• the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been instituted or that may be instituted against IAC, ANGI Homeservices,

RISK FACTORS 

        In addition to the other information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus (including the information incorporated by
reference into this proxy statement/prospectus), Angie's List stockholders should carefully consider all of the following risk factors in
deciding whether to vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement at the Angie's List special meeting. Angie's List stockholders
should read and consider the risks associated with each of the HomeAdvisor Business and the businesses of Angie's List because these
risks are expected to apply to ANGI Homeservices following the completion of the Transactions. Prior to making any decision regarding
the Transactions, you should carefully read this entire proxy statement/prospectus, including its Annexes and the other documents
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, and in particular the sections entitled "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of Angie's
List's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly
periods ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017. See the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information."

Risks Related to the Transactions

There can be no assurances regarding the prices at which Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices will trade following the completion of
the Transactions.

        Assuming the Merger is completed as described elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, some or all of the Angie's List
stockholders will receive Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices as a result of the Merger. The Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices are
not and never have been listed for trading on a national securities exchange or otherwise publicly traded. Such shares are expected to be
approved for listing on NASDAQ prior to the completion of the Merger, and such approval for listing is one of the conditions to the
completion of the Merger.

        The trading price of a Class A share of ANGI Homeservices following the Merger is uncertain, and there can be no assurances as to
the values at which Class A shares will trade following the Merger. In addition, following the Merger, the trading price of Class A shares
of ANGI Homeservices is likely to fluctuate and will be dependent on, and subject to fluctuations relating to, general market and economic
conditions, changes in the businesses of Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business (whether prior to or following the completion of the
Merger), and regulatory considerations, among other things. Some of these factors and conditions are beyond the control of Angie's List,
the HomeAdvisor Business and ANGI Homeservices. For further discussion of these and other risks regarding ownership of ANGI
Homeservices Class A shares, see the section below entitled "—Risks Related to an Investment in Class A Shares of ANGI
Homeservices."

Angie's List stockholders who elect to receive the Cash Consideration may receive a prorated portion of their Merger Consideration in
the form of the Share Consideration if the aggregate cap on the Cash Consideration of $130 million is exceeded.

        Each Angie's List stockholder will be entitled to elect to receive in the Merger, for each share of Angie's List common stock held at
the Effective Time, the Share Consideration or the Cash Consideration (or a combination thereof, by electing Cash Consideration with
respect to some shares and Share Consideration with respect to other shares held by such stockholder). Elections to receive the Cash
Consideration by Angie's List stockholders will be subject to the proration procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement, such that Angie's
List stockholders will receive in the aggregate no more than $130 million in cash. For more information, including an illustrative example
of this proration procedure, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Election Procedures for the Share Consideration and the
Cash Consideration; Aggregate Cap and Possible Proration of the Cash Consideration."

        Depending on the elections made by other Angie's List stockholders, the aggregate Cash Consideration cap of $130 million may be
exceeded, in which case Angie's List stockholders who

Table of Contents

properly elected to receive Cash Consideration in the Merger will receive a portion of their Merger Consideration in respect of the Angie's
List shares for which the Cash Consideration was properly elected in the form of the Share Consideration. Stockholders who receive the
Share Consideration will be subject to a number of additional risks relating to ANGI Homeservices and its Class A shares (including the
market for buying and selling such shares), as discussed elsewhere in this section.

Angie's List stockholders who make elections to receive the Share Consideration or the Cash Consideration will be unable to sell their
Angie's List shares while the Merger remains pending.

        As described elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, Angie's List stockholders may elect to receive cash, stock or a
combination of cash and stock for their shares of Angie's List in the Merger by completing an election form that will be sent under
separate cover and is not being provided with this proxy statement/prospectus. Elections will require that stockholders making the election
submit their shares of Angie's List common stock, including any stock certificates, or in the case of book-entry shares of Angie's List
common stock, any additional documents specified in the procedures set forth in the election form, in order for the election to be properly
made. This means that during the time between when the election is made and the Closing Date, Angie's List stockholders who have
submitted an election form to receive the Share Consideration or the Cash Consideration will be unable to sell the shares of Angie's List
common stock with respect to which any such election has been made unless they first withdraw their election. If the Merger is
unexpectedly delayed, this period could extend for a significant period of time. Angie's List stockholders can shorten the period during
which they cannot sell their shares by delivering their election shortly before the election deadline. However, elections received after the
election deadline will not be accepted or honored. For further details, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Election
Procedures for the Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration; Aggregate Cap and Possible Proration of the Cash Consideration."

Both individually and as a group, Angie's List stockholders will have significantly reduced ownership and voting interests in ANGI
Homeservices after the Merger relative to their interests in Angie's List prior to the Merger, and, with limited exceptions for certain
class votes, IAC will be able to control any corporate action that requires a vote of ANGI Homeservices stockholders, in addition to
appointing a majority of the board of directors.

        Angie's List stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the Angie's List board of directors and on other matters
affecting Angie's List. Upon the consummation of the Merger, each Angie's List stockholder that receives the Share Consideration will
become a stockholder of ANGI Homeservices with a percentage ownership of ANGI Homeservices that is significantly smaller than such
stockholder's percentage ownership of Angie's List immediately prior to the Merger. Immediately following the Closing, depending on the
number of Angie's List stockholders that elect to receive Cash Consideration, former holders of Angie's List common stock and equity
awards are expected to hold, in the aggregate, Class A shares representing between approximately 10% (assuming Angie's List
stockholders elect to receive the maximum aggregate Cash Consideration) and 13% (assuming no Angie's List stockholders elect to
receive Cash Consideration) of the economic interest in ANGI Homeservices common stock (on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the
treasury stock method), and less than 2% of the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices common stock, and IAC is expected to hold
Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices which, together with Class A shares underlying equity awards in respect of HomeAdvisor (US) to
be converted into awards in respect of ANGI Homeservices, will represent between approximately 87% and 90% of the economic interest
(on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury stock method) and approximately 98% of the total voting power of ANGI
Homeservices common stock.

        On this basis, with limited exceptions for certain class votes, IAC will be able to control any corporate action that requires a vote of
ANGI Homeservices stockholders, in addition to appointing a

majority of the board of directors. For further details regarding the expected ownership and corporate governance of ANGI Homeservices
following the Merger, as well as the rights of Angie's List stockholders who receive the Share Consideration as holders of Class A shares
of ANGI Homeservices following the Merger, see the sections entitled "—Risks Related to ANGI Homeservices' Ongoing Relationship
with IAC Following the Completion of the Transactions," "Corporate Governance of ANGI Homeservices Following the Merger," "Board
of Directors and Executive Officers of ANGI Homeservices Following the Merger" and "Comparison of the Rights of Angie's List
Stockholders and Holders of Class A Shares of ANGI Homeservices."

The completion of the Transactions is subject to a number of conditions, some of which are outside the control of Angie's List, IAC
and ANGI Homeservices, and the Transactions may not be completed on a timely basis or at all. Failure to complete the Transactions
could negatively impact the share price and the future business and financial results of Angie's List.

        The completion of the Contribution, the IAC Share Issuance and the Merger are all subject to a number of conditions, some of which
are outside the control of Angie's List, IAC and ANGI Homeservices, and the failure to satisfy any such condition, or delays or difficulties
that may occur in attempting to satisfy any such conditions, may prevent, delay or otherwise impair the completion of the Transactions in a
material way. These conditions include, in the case of the Merger, the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders, and
as a result there exists some uncertainty regarding the timing of the completion of the Transactions, and whether the Transactions will be
completed at all. Furthermore, either IAC or Angie's List may terminate the Merger Agreement in specified circumstances, including if the
Merger has not been consummated on or prior to February 1, 2018 (provided that this right to terminate will not be available to a party if
the failure of the Closing to occur by such date was due to a material breach of the Merger Agreement by the party seeking to terminate).
For more information, see the sections entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger" and "—Termination of
the Merger Agreement."

        If the Transactions are not completed on a timely basis, or at all, the business, financial results and prospects of Angie's List, as well
as the market price of Angie's List common stock, may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the potential benefits of having
completed the Transactions, Angie's List and its stockholders will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:

• Angie's List will be required to pay IAC a termination fee of $20 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated in
specified circumstances, as further described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Effects of Termination of the
Merger Agreement; Termination Fee and Expenses"; 

• time and resources spent or committed by Angie's List's management to matters relating to the Transactions (including
integration planning and expenses for professional services and other transaction costs, many of which are payable by
Angie's List regardless of whether or not the Transactions are consummated) that could otherwise have been devoted to
pursuing other beneficial opportunities for Angie's List will have been largely wasted; 

• negative publicity and a negative impression of Angie's List in the business community; and 

• if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Angie's List board of directors seeks an alternative business combination,
Angie's List stockholders cannot be certain that Angie's List will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction
agreement on terms equivalent to, or more attractive than, the terms that IAC has agreed to in the Transactions.

While the Transactions are pending, uncertainty regarding the completion of the Transactions may cause consumers, service
professionals and other important business counterparties to delay or defer decisions concerning Angie's List and may adversely affect
Angie's List's ability to attract and retain employees, consumers and service professionals.

        The Merger will be completed only if specified conditions are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived), including the adoption of
the Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders. For a description of these conditions, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement
—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger." The satisfaction of some of these conditions is beyond the control of IAC, Angie's List and
ANGI Homeservices. In addition, both IAC and Angie's List have specified rights to terminate the Merger Agreement in various
circumstances, as described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement."

        While the Transactions remain pending, uncertainty regarding whether (and when) the Transactions may be completed may cause
consumers, service professionals or other parties with whom Angie's List has business relationships to delay or defer decisions concerning
Angie's List, or to seek to terminate their relationships with Angie's List, which could negatively impact the financial condition and results
of operations of Angie's List, regardless of whether the Transactions are ultimately completed. In addition, such consumers, service
professionals or other parties may experience uncertainty associated with the Merger, including with respect to concerns about possible
changes to Angie's List's technology platform, including website and mobile applications, products, services or policies and current or
future business relationships with Angie's List. Such uncertainty may cause such consumers, service professionals or other parties to
refrain from using Angie's List's products and services, potentially yielding a reduction in traffic across Angie's List's platforms, all of
which could negatively and materially impact Angie's List's business, financial condition or results of operations. Similarly, uncertainty
regarding the completion of the Transactions may foster uncertainty among employees about their future roles with the combined
company, and may create difficulties in recruiting new employees, consumers and service professionals who may be similarly concerned
by the various pending changes and uncertainties. As such, the pendency of the Transactions may adversely affect the ability of Angie's
List to attract and retain key management, sales, marketing and technical personnel, as well as new consumers and service professionals.

        Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Angie's List is subject to certain covenants regarding the conduct of its
business during the interim period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the completion of the Transactions, including
covenants related to Angie's List's ability to enter into material contracts and acquire or dispose of assets. These covenants may prevent
Angie's List from taking actions with respect to its business that it may consider advantageous and result in Angie's List's inability to
respond effectively to competitive pressures or industry developments, among other things, which could thereby harm Angie's List's
business, financial condition or results of operations.

Some of Angie's List's current directors and executive officers have interests in the Transactions that may differ from the interests of
other Angie's List stockholders.

        In considering whether to approve the proposals set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus to be voted on at the Angie's List special
meeting, including the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should recognize that some of the members of management and of
the Angie's List board of directors may have interests in the Transactions that differ from, or are in addition to, their interests as Angie's
List stockholders. These interests include:

• the rights of some executive officers to receive payments or other benefits, including the conversion of certain stock
options and restricted stock unit awards, acceleration of the vesting of certain equity awards, and possible payments due
upon certain terminations of employment during a specified period prior to or following a change in control;

omissions that occurred in their capacity as directors or officers prior to the Closing.

        These interests are further described in the section entitled "The Transactions—Interests of Angie's List's Directors and Executive
Officers in the Transactions."

The Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit Angie's List's ability to pursue alternatives to the Transactions, could discourage
a potential competing acquiror of Angie's List from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and, in specified
circumstances, could require Angie's List to pay a termination fee of $20 million to IAC.

        The Merger Agreement contains provisions that restrict Angie's List's ability during the pendency of the Merger to, among other
things, solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries regarding, or the making, submission or announcement
by any person of any proposal or offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to, certain alternative transactions. In
addition, IAC is generally entitled to an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the Merger Agreement in response to any third-party
alternative transaction proposal before the Angie's List board of directors may change its recommendation in favor of the adoption of the
Merger Agreement or terminate the Merger Agreement to accept an alternative proposal. For further details on these restrictions, including
with respect to certain exceptions to these restrictions, see the sections entitled "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation by Angie's List
of Alternative Takeover Proposals" and "—Change in the Angie's List Board Recommendation."

        Moreover, if the Merger Agreement is terminated in specified circumstances, including if Angie's List terminates the Merger
Agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a "Superior Proposal," Angie's List will be required to pay a
termination fee of $20 million to IAC. For further details, see the sections entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger
Agreement" and "—Effects of Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fee and Expenses."

        These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquiror or merger partner that might have an interest in acquiring all or a
significant portion of Angie's List's business, or pursuing another form of alternative transaction involving Angie's List, from considering
or proposing such a transaction, even if the third party was prepared to pay consideration having greater perceived value than that of the
Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration being offered in the Merger. In addition, these provisions might result in a potential third-
party acquiror or merger partner proposing to pay a lower price to the stockholders of Angie's List than it might otherwise have proposed
to pay because of the added expense of the $20 million termination fee that may become payable in specified circumstances.

Angie's List stockholders will not be entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights in the Merger.

        Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction,
such as a merger, and demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding
instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with such extraordinary transaction.

        Appraisal rights are not available in all circumstances, and exceptions to these rights are provided under the DGCL. In the Merger,
because Angie's List common stock is listed on NASDAQ, and because Angie's List stockholders are not required to accept in the Merger
any consideration in exchange for their shares of Angie's List common stock other than Class A shares of ANGI

Homeservices, which will be publicly listed on NASDAQ, and cash in lieu of fractional shares (if applicable), holders of Angie's List
common stock will not be entitled to any appraisal rights in connection with the Merger with respect to their shares of Angie's List
common stock. For a more detailed description of the relevant provisions of the DGCL, see the section entitled "The Transactions—No
Appraisal Rights."

ANGI Homeservices may not realize the expected benefits of the Transactions on the anticipated timeframes or at all.

        The benefits of the Transactions to ANGI Homeservices and its stockholders following the Merger may not be realized as expected or
may not be achieved within the anticipated timeframes or at all. The ability of ANGI Homeservices to realize the anticipated benefits of
the Transactions will depend, to a large extent, on its ability to combine the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List in a manner that
facilitates growth opportunities, realizes anticipated synergies and achieves the projected cost savings and revenue growth expected by
IAC and Angie's List management. For further details regarding these expectations, see the section entitled "The Transactions—Joint
Reasons of Angie's List and IAC for the Transactions."

        IAC and Angie's List will be required to devote significant attention and resources prior to the Closing to prepare for the post-Closing
operation of ANGI Homeservices, and ANGI Homeservices will be required post-Closing to devote significant attention and resources to
successfully align the business practices and integrate the operations of the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List. This process may
disrupt the businesses or cause a loss of momentum in the activities of ANGI Homeservices following the Closing and may adversely
affect its business and results of operations. The overall combination of the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List may also result in
unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, responses from competitors, loss of customer and other business relationships and the
diversion of management attention. If ANGI Homeservices is not able to efficiently and successfully integrate the HomeAdvisor Business
with Angie's List following the Merger, the anticipated benefits of the Transactions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to
realize than expected, which would have a negative effect on the business and financial results of the combined company and on the value
of the Class A shares to be issued to Angie's List stockholders who receive the Share Consideration in the Merger.

        Even if the operations of the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List are combined successfully, the full benefits of the Transactions
may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities that are expected, due to competitive pressures,
changes in general market or economic conditions or other factors. Moreover, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in combining
the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List. All of these factors could negatively affect the business and financial results of ANGI
Homeservices and the market price of ANGI Homeservices Class A shares.

Pending litigation against ANGI Homeservices could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the Transactions or a
judgment resulting in the payment of damages.

        ANGI Homeservices, Merger Sub, IAC, Angie's List and the members of the Angie's List board of directors are named as defendants
in two putative class action lawsuits challenging the Merger. The first suit was filed on July 18, 2017 and is captioned Parshall v. Angie's
List, Inc., C.A. No. 1:17-cv-02418. The second suit was filed on July 20, 2017 and is captioned Pill v. Angie's List, Inc., C.A. No. 1:17-cv-
02461. Both suits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. Other potential plaintiffs may also file
additional lawsuits challenging the proposed Merger or any of the other Transactions. The outcome of any such litigation is uncertain.

        If not resolved, the pending lawsuits, or any additional litigation, could prevent or delay completion of the Merger or any of the other
Transactions and result in substantial costs to ANGI

Homeservices, IAC and Angie's List, including any costs associated with the indemnification of the Angie's List board of directors. One
condition to Closing is that no court or other governmental authority in a competent jurisdiction (which would include the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of Indiana) has issued an injunction or similar order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or any of
the other Transactions. If any lawsuit is successful in obtaining an injunction preventing the parties to the Merger Agreement from
consummating the Merger or the other Transactions, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from being completed, or from being
completed within the expected timeframe. Additionally, if the Merger is completed, ANGI Homeservices would assume the risks
associated with litigation related to the Transactions that Angie's List and the members of the Angie's List board of directors are party to,
and ANGI Homeservices has agreed pursuant to and in accordance with the Merger Agreement to cause Angie's List to continue to
indemnify Angie's List's directors and officers after the completion of the Transactions for acts or omissions that occurred in their capacity
as directors or officers prior to the Closing.

        The defense or settlement of the pending lawsuits and any additional litigation could be time-consuming and expensive, divert the
attention of the IAC and ANGI Homeservices management and/or the Angie's List management away from their regular business, and, if
any one of the pending lawsuits or any future litigation is adversely resolved against IAC or Angie's List, could have a material adverse
effect on their respective financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of IAC or ANGI Homeservices if resolved after the Merger
is completed. For more information, see "The Transactions—Litigation Related to the Merger."

Risks Related to the Business of ANGI Homeservices Following the Completion of the Transactions

General economic events or trends, particularly those that adversely impact consumer confidence and spending behavior, could harm
ANGI Homeservices' business, financial condition and results of operations.

        The HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List have historically been, and following the completion of the Transactions ANGI
Homeservices will be, particularly sensitive to events and trends that adversely affect consumer confidence and spending behavior. For
example, in the event of a general economic downturn or sudden disruption in business conditions, consumer confidence, spending levels
and access to credit could be adversely affected. The occurrence of any of these events or trends could result in consumers delaying or
foregoing home services projects, which could result in decreases in service requests and a decrease in fees paid by service professionals
for consumer matches, which could adversely affect ANGI Homeservices' business, financial condition and results of operations.

        ANGI Homeservices could also experience turnover in its network of service professionals given that a significant number of these
service professionals are sole proprietorships and small businesses, and as such, are particularly sensitive to events and trends that
adversely impact consumer confidence and spending behavior. Any turnover, if significant or recurring over a prolonged period, could
adversely impact the number and quality of the service professionals who are members of the ANGI Homeservices network, the reach of
that network and the breadth of services offered through the ANGI Homeservices marketplace, any or all of which could result in a
decrease in traffic to ANGI Homeservices' properties and increased costs, all of which could adversely affect its business, financial
condition and results of operations.

        Finally, ANGI Homeservices will also be sensitive to events and trends that could result in decreased marketing and advertising
expenditures by service professionals. Adverse economic conditions and trends could result in service professionals decreasing and/or
delaying marketing and advertising expenditures, or decreasing the amount they are willing to pay for connections to consumers through
the platforms operated by ANGI Homeservices, either of which would result in decreased revenue and could adversely affect ANGI
Homeservices' business, financial condition and results of operations.

The success of ANGI Homeservices will depend, in substantial part, on the migration of the home services market online.

        The digital penetration of the home services market remains low, with the vast majority of home services customers finding their
service professional offline, according to a HomeAdvisor Business internal brand tracking study. While many consumer demographics
have historically been (and remain) averse to hiring service professionals online, certain consumer demographics have demonstrated
greater willingness to embrace the online shift. For example, millennial homeowners are more willing than homeowners aged 50 plus to
hire a service professional online. Accordingly, as millennial homeownership increases, it is expected that more service professionals will
be hired online. Service professionals must also embrace the online shift, which ANGI Homeservices expects will occur with more
frequency as they experience the benefits of connecting and engaging with consumers online (for example, the ability to reach the largest
consumer audience, trackable return on marketing investments and tailored customer management tools) relative to traditional offline
efforts. Continued digital and mobile product innovation is also expected to increase online adoption by consumers and service
professionals. However, the speed and ultimate outcome of this shift to online marketplaces for finding service professionals is uncertain
and may not occur as quickly as ANGI Homeservices expects or at all. The failure or delay of a meaningful number of consumers and/or
service professionals to migrate online, or the choice of a meaningful number of existing participants in the online home services
marketplace to return to offline markets, could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of ANGI
Homeservices.

ANGI Homeservices will need to establish and maintain relationships with quality service professionals.

        To succeed, ANGI Homeservices will need to continue to attract and retain service professionals and grow its network of service
professionals who are skilled, reliable and provide services consumers want in a timely manner. To do so, ANGI Homeservices must
continue to offer innovative products and services that resonate with consumers and service professionals generally, as well provide
service professionals with an attractive return on their marketing investments. If ANGI Homeservices fails to provide compelling products
and services, service professionals may leave (or fail to join) the ANGI Homeservices network, or may choose to use its platforms less
frequently, which would result in a less attractive marketplace for consumers seeking quality service professionals. In addition, a decrease
in quality service professionals (or the lack of potential new quality service professionals) in the markets in which ANGI Homeservices
maintains service professional networks would result in a smaller and less diverse network, which could adversely impact the consumer
experience and result in decreases in service requests and directory searches, which could adversely impact the business, financial
condition and results of operations of ANGI Homeservices.

The success of ANGI Homeservices will depend, in substantial part, on its ability to maintain and/or enhance its various brands.

        After the completion of the Transactions, ANGI Homeservices will own and operate two of the leading home services brands in the
United States, as well as leading brands in a number of foreign jurisdictions. Brand recognition is a key differentiating factor among
providers of online services generally, and ANGI Homeservices believes that its success will depend, in part, on its ability to maintain and
enhance the brands established by the HomeAdvisor Business and by Angie's List, as well as build awareness of (and loyalty to) any of its
new and emerging brands by consumers and service professionals alike.

        The brands of ANGI Homeservices could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including product quality concerns, service
professional quality concerns, consumer and service professional complaints, actions brought by consumers or service professionals,
fraudulent or otherwise unlawful acts perpetrated by consumers or service professionals, actions or proceedings commenced by
governmental or regulatory authorities, privacy and security breaches and related bad publicity.

        In addition, trust in the integrity and objective, unbiased nature of the ratings and reviews found on the properties operated by Angie's
List and the HomeAdvisor Business contributes significantly to the perception of their brands and to their ability to attract new consumers
and service professionals. If existing or prospective consumers perceive that the consumer reviews on Angie's List or the HomeAdvisor
properties are not authentic in general, the reputation and the strength of ANGI Homeservices' brands could be materially and adversely
affected. While the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List use, and ANGI Homeservices will continue to use, filters to detect fraudulent
reviews, the accuracy of consumer reviews cannot be guaranteed. If fraudulent or inaccurate reviews—positive or negative—increase, and
ANGI Homeservices is unable to effectively identify and remove such reviews, the overall quality of its ratings and reviews could
decrease, and the reputation of the brands of ANGI Homeservices might be harmed, which could deter consumers and service
professionals from using its products and services. This could negatively impact the brands, business, financial condition and results of
operations of ANGI Homeservices.

        Moreover, ANGI Homeservices' failure to market its products and services successfully (or in a cost-effective manner), inability to
develop and introduce products and services that resonate with consumers and/or inability to adapt quickly enough (and/or in a cost-
effective manner) to evolving changes in the internet and related technologies, applications and devices, could adversely impact the
various brands of ANGI Homeservices and its brand-building efforts, and in turn, its business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Marketing efforts designed to drive traffic to the ANGI Homeservices properties may not be successful or cost-effective.

        Attracting consumers and service professionals to ANGI Homeservices properties will involve considerable expenditures for offline
and online marketing. The HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List have made, and following the completion of the Transactions ANGI
Homeservices expects to continue to make, significant marketing expenditures, primarily for television advertising and search engine
marketing, which may not be successful or cost-effective. Historically, the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List have had to increase
marketing expenditures over time to attract and retain consumers and service professionals and sustain growth.

        As traditional television viewership declines and consumers increasingly consume media through various digital means, the reach of
traditional advertising channels is contracting and the number of digital advertising channels is increasing. To continue to reach consumers
and service professionals and grow its businesses in this environment, ANGI Homeservices will need to devote more of its overall
marketing expenditures to newer digital advertising channels, which are undeveloped and unproven relative to traditional advertising
channels, and engage consumers and service professionals via new digital means.

        With respect to online marketing efforts, rapid and frequent changes in the pricing and operating dynamics of search engines, as well
as changing policies and guidelines applicable to keyword advertising (which may unilaterally be updated by search engine providers
without advance notice), could adversely affect paid search engine marketing efforts and free search engine traffic. Such changes could
adversely affect paid listings (both their placement and pricing), as well as the ranking of ANGI Homeservices websites within paid and
organic search results, any or all of which could increase marketing expenditures (particularly if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic).
Additionally, if ANGI Homeservices starts depending on other digital platforms in the future for free traffic, these efforts will involve
challenges and risks similar to those related to free traffic.

        Separately, search engine providers continue to expand their offerings into other, non-search-related categories, including home
services. Search engine providers may display their own integrated or related home services offerings in a more prominent manner than
those of ANGI Homeservices, which could result in a substantial decrease in free traffic to ANGI Homeservices websites and, in turn,
increased marketing expenditures if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic.

        No assurances can be provided that ANGI Homeservices will be able to continue to appropriately manage and fine-tune its paid
marketing efforts in response to any or all of the events and trends discussed above and the failure to do so could adversely affect its
business, financial condition and results of operations.

The ability of ANGI Homeservices to introduce new and enhanced products and services that resonate with consumers and service
professionals, including in response to rapidly evolving trends and technologies, will be critical to its success.

        ANGI Homeservices will not succeed unless it is able to introduce new and enhanced products and services in response to evolving
trends and technologies and provide quality products and services that otherwise resonate with consumers and service professionals. There
is intense competition to operate the leading online marketplaces for home services (and more generally for all consumer products and
services), and online marketplaces have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, subject to rapid technological change.
Generally, the development of new and enhanced products and services, as well as the identification of new business opportunities in a
constantly changing business and technological environment, requires significant time and resources. ANGI Homeservices may not be
able to adapt quickly enough to trends online and/or in the home services market (including changes in consumer and service professional
preferences and needs), appropriately time the introduction of new and enhanced services and/or identify new business opportunities in a
timely manner.

        For example, while many consumers and service professionals may continue to access ANGI Homeservices offerings through
personal computers, usage of mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, continues to increase relative to that of personal
computers. In addition, consumers are increasingly seeking to access services through so-called digital assistants, such as Amazon's Echo
or Google's Home product. The HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List have dedicated (and following the completion of the
Transactions, ANGI Homeservices will dedicate) significant time and resources to ensure that their product offerings work across multiple
platforms, but ANGI Homeservices may not be successful in keeping up with future technological developments. Even if ANGI
Homeservices is able to do so, these efforts could be more costly than anticipated or require partnership or distribution arrangements with
third-party providers in order to reach consumers.

        In addition, new and/or enhanced products or services may not resonate with consumers and service professionals and, in turn, not
generate sufficient traffic and otherwise prove challenging to monetize. Efforts to improve the ANGI Homeservices platforms or otherwise
improve its offerings could also require the modification of related technological infrastructures; and the failure to do so in an efficient and
cost-effective manner could render ANGI Homeservices websites, applications, services and proprietary technologies obsolete.

        The failure to respond to any evolving trends and technologies appropriately and in a cost-effective manner could adversely affect the
business, financial condition and results of operations of ANGI Homeservices.

The success of ANGI Homeservices will depend, in part, on the integrity of its systems and infrastructures and on its ability to
enhance, expand and adapt these systems and infrastructures in a timely and cost-effective manner.

        For ANGI Homeservices to succeed, its systems and infrastructures must perform well on a consistent basis. From time to time,
ANGI Homeservices may experience system interruptions that make some or all of its systems or data unavailable and prevent services
from functioning properly for consumers and service professionals. Any such interruption could arise for any number of reasons. Further,
the systems and infrastructures of ANGI Homeservices will be vulnerable to damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failures
and similar events. While ANGI Homeservices will have

backup systems in place for certain aspects of its operations, its systems and infrastructures will not be fully redundant, disaster recovery
planning will not be sufficient for all eventualities and property and business interruption insurance coverage may not be adequate to
compensate ANGI Homeservices fully for any losses that it may suffer. Any interruptions or outages, regardless of the cause, could
negatively impact the experiences of consumers and service professionals, tarnish the reputation of the various brands of ANGI
Homeservices and decrease demand for its services, any or all of which could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results
of operations of ANGI Homeservices.

        ANGI Homeservices will also need to continually work to expand and enhance the efficiency and scalability of its technology and
network systems to improve the experience of consumers and service professionals, accommodate substantial increases in traffic to its
various services, ensure acceptable page load times for its various services and keep up with changes in technology and consumer and
service professional preferences and needs. Any failure to do so in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely affect the
experiences of consumers and service professionals and thereby negatively impact the demand for ANGI Homeservices' offerings, and
could increase costs, any of which could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of ANGI
Homeservices.

ANGI Homeservices' success will depend, in part, on the integrity of third-party systems and infrastructure.

        After completion of the Transactions, ANGI Homeservices will rely on third parties, primarily data-center service providers, as well
as third-party computer systems, broadband and other communication systems and service providers, in connection with the provision of
its products generally, as well as to facilitate and process certain transactions with its users. ANGI Homeservices will have limited or no
control over these third parties and their operations.

        Problems experienced by third-party data center service providers upon whom ANGI Homeservices may rely, the
telecommunications network providers with whom it contracts or with the systems through which telecommunications providers allocate
capacity among their customers could also adversely affect ANGI Homeservices. Any changes in service levels at its data centers or any
interruptions, outages or delays in ANGI Homeservices' systems or those of its third-party providers, or deterioration in the performance of
these systems, could impair its ability to provide its products or process transactions with its users, which would adversely impact its
business, financial condition and results of operations.

ANGI Homeservices may not be able to protect its information technology systems and infrastructure from cyberattacks and may be
adversely affected by cyberattacks experienced by third parties.

        The business of ANGI Homeservices will rely extensively on secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other
information in its computer systems and networks and communications systems. ANGI Homeservices may be subject to attacks by
perpetrators of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive
software, distributed denial of service attacks and attempts to misappropriate consumer or service professional information, including
credit card information, personal information and confidential business information. While the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List
have invested (and, following the completion of the Transactions, ANGI Homeservices will continue to invest) in the protection of their
information technology systems and infrastructure and related training, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent significant
breaches in their systems or other such events from occurring. As malicious cyber activity escalates, so do the risks relating to the
transmission, storage or processing of data both within and outside the ANGI Homeservices network, including use by ANGI
Homeservices of service providers outside of its network. Any cyber or similar attack against which ANGI Homeservices is unable to
protect itself could damage its systems and infrastructure, prevent it from providing its products, erode its reputation and brands, lead to
termination of advantageous contracts, result in inaccurate reporting of financial information, result in the disclosure of confidential
information of its users, expose it to significant liabilities relating to breaches of data

privacy laws, result in the disclosure of confidential and sensitive business information or intellectual property, result in claims or litigation
against it, and/or be costly to mitigate or remedy. In addition, although ANGI Homeservices will have some insurance to mitigate these
risks, such policies may not cover the particular attack experienced and, even if the risk is covered, such insurance coverage may not be
adequate to compensate for the losses resulting from any of these events.

        The impact of cybersecurity events experienced by third parties with whom ANGI Homeservices will do business (or upon whom
ANGI Homeservices otherwise will rely in connection with its day-to-day operations) could have a similar effect on it. Moreover, even
cyber or similar attacks that do not directly affect ANGI Homeservices or third parties with whom ANGI Homeservices will do business
may result in a loss of consumer confidence in internet-based or technology-reliant businesses generally, which could make users less
likely to use or continue to use ANGI Homeservices' products and services. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse
effect on the future business, financial condition and results of operations of ANGI Homeservices.

Unauthorized access to personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulations and legal requirements, and
compliance with laws designed to prevent unauthorized access of personal data could be costly.

        Security breaches or other unauthorized access to, or the use or transmission of, personal consumer and service professional
information could result in a variety of claims against ANGI Homeservices, including privacy-related claims. There are numerous laws
and regulations in the countries in which ANGI Homeservices businesses will operate regarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use,
processing, disclosure and protection of personal information. The scope and subject matter of these laws and regulations have changed
considerably in the recent past and are expected to continue to evolve, and likely expand, in the future. In 2016, the European Commission
adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, a comprehensive European Union privacy and data protection reform that is expected to
become effective in May 2018. In addition, the potential exit from the European Union by the United Kingdom could result in the
application of new data privacy and protection laws and standards to ANGI Homeservices' operations in the United Kingdom and the
handling of personal data of consumers located in the United Kingdom. At the same time, certain developing countries are also currently
considering adopting privacy and data protection laws and regulations and legislative proposals concerning privacy and the protection of
consumer information are pending before the U.S. Congress and various U.S. state legislatures.

        Any failure or perceived failure by ANGI Homeservices (or the third parties with whom it contracts to store personal consumer and
service professional information) to comply with applicable privacy and security laws, policies or related contractual obligations or any
compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to or acquisition or use of personal consumer or service provider information
could result in governmental enforcement actions, significant fines, litigation, claims of breach of contract and indemnity by third parties
and adverse publicity. In the case of such an event, the reputation of ANGI Homeservices and its businesses could be harmed, it could lose
consumers and service professionals and the competitive positions of its various brands could be diminished, any or all of which could
adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of ANGI Homeservices.

        Lastly, compliance with the numerous laws and regulations in the countries in which ANGI Homeservices businesses will operate
regarding privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal data could be costly, particularly if, as
expected, these laws and regulations continue to evolve and become more comprehensive in scope or require changes to the information
technology operations of ANGI Homeservices. If these costs are significant, the business, financial condition and results of operations of
ANGI Homeservices could be adversely affected.

ANGI Homeservices will be subject to a number of risks related to credit card payments, including data security breaches and fraud
that ANGI Homeservices or third parties may experience, as well as additional regulation, any of which could adversely affect the
business, financial condition and results of operations of ANGI Homeservices.

        The HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List have historically accepted, and after completion of the Transactions, ANGI
Homeservices will continue to accept, payments (including recurring payments) from service professionals and members, as applicable,
primarily through credit and debit card transactions. The ability to access credit card information on a real-time basis without having to
proactively reach out to service professionals and members to process these payments will be critical to the success of ANGI
Homeservices' businesses.

        When ANGI Homeservices or a third party experiences a data security breach involving credit card information, affected cardholders
will often cancel their credit cards. In the case of a breach experienced by a third party, the more sizable the third party's customer base and
the greater the number of credit card accounts impacted, the more likely it is that users of ANGI Homeservices would be impacted by such
a breach. To the extent ANGI Homeservices users are ever affected by such a breach experienced by ANGI Homeservices or a third party,
affected users would need to be contacted to obtain new credit card information and process any pending payments. It is likely that ANGI
Homeservices would not be able to reach all affected service professionals and members, and even if it could, some new credit card
information may not be obtained and some pending payments may not be processed, which could adversely affect ANGI Homeservices'
business, financial condition and results of operations.

        Even if service professionals and members are not directly impacted by a given data security breach, they may lose confidence in the
ability of service providers to protect their personal information generally, which could cause them to stop using their credit cards online
and choose alternative payment methods that are not as convenient for ANGI Homeservices or restrict its ability to process payments
without significant effort by the applicable service professionals or members.

        The ability of ANGI Homeservices to access credit card information on a real-time basis without having to proactively reach out to
service professionals and members could also be adversely impacted by increases in various fees charged by credit card companies and
processors (such as transaction, interchange, chargeback and/or other fees), the malfunction of credit card billing systems and software and
non-compliance with applicable payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds
transfers, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard ("PCI DSS"), a security standard with which companies that
collect, store or transmit certain data related to credit and debit cards, credit and debit card holders and credit and debit card transactions
are required to comply. If ANGI Homeservices fails to adequately prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and comply with the PCI
DSS, it could face litigation, fines, governmental enforcement action, civil liability, diminished public perception of its security measures,
significantly higher credit card-related costs and substantial remediation costs, any of which could adversely affect its business, financial
condition and results of operations.

        Finally, the passage or adoption of any legislation or regulation affecting the ability of service providers to periodically charge
consumers for recurring membership payments could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of ANGI
Homeservices.

ANGI Homeservices may fail to adequately protect its intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing the intellectual
property rights of third parties.

        The HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List have relied, and after the completion of the Transactions ANGI Homeservices will rely,
heavily upon its trademarks and related domain names and logos to market its brands and to build and maintain brand loyalty and
recognition, as well as upon

trade secrets. For example, the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List have generally registered, and will continue to apply to register
and renew, or secure by contract where appropriate, trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve, register
and renew domain names as deemed appropriate. Effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every
country in which products and services are made available, and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private
contracts. Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available or be registered, even if available.

        The HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List also rely, and after the completion of the Transactions ANGI Homeservices will rely, on
a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect their
various intellectual property rights.

        The HomeAdvisor Business generally seeks to apply for patents or for other similar statutory protections as and if it deems
appropriate, based on then-current facts and circumstances, and after the completion of the Transactions ANGI Homeservices may
continue to do so in the future. No assurances can be given that any patent application that the HomeAdvisor Business has filed (or that
ANGI Homeservices may file) will result in a patent being issued, or that any existing or future patents will afford adequate protection
against competitors and similar technologies. In addition, no assurances can be given that third parties will not create new products or
methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by the HomeAdvisor Business or ANGI Homeservices after
completion of the Transactions. Angie's List does not have any patents or pending patent applications.

        Despite these measures, the intellectual property rights of the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List may still not be protected in a
meaningful manner, challenges to contractual rights could arise or third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use the intellectual
property of the HomeAdvisor Business or of Angie's List without authorization. The occurrence of any of these events could result in the
erosion of the HomeAdvisor and the Angie's List brands and limitations on the ability of the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List, or
after the completion of the Transactions of ANGI Homeservices, to control marketing on or through the internet using its various domain
names, as well as impede its ability to effectively compete against competitors with similar technologies, any of which could adversely
affect ANGI Homeservices' business, financial condition and results of operations.

ANGI Homeservices will face a number of risks in connection with its international operations.

        Angie's List operates primarily within the United States. However, the HomeAdvisor Business has historically operated in various
jurisdictions and, following the completion of the Transactions, ANGI Homeservices will own and operate businesses in France, the
Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom and Canada under various regional brands. ANGI Homeservices intends to seek
to establish strategic control and market leadership for these brands through significant investments in marketing, sales forces and product
innovation, which may not be successful or cost-effective. ANGI Homeservices also intends to seek to expand into additional European
and select other jurisdictions in the future, both through acquisitions and organic growth.

        Acquiring, operating and building brands and businesses abroad, particularly in jurisdictions where ANGI Homeservices has limited
experience, will involve a number of additional risks, including:

• operational and compliance challenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences; 

• difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; 

• differing levels of social and technological acceptance of online services (or lack of acceptance of them) generally, as well
as home services offerings specifically; 

• foreign currency fluctuations;

• restrictions on the transfer of funds among countries and back to the United States and costs associated with repatriating
funds to the United States; 

• differing and potentially adverse tax laws; 

• multiple, conflicting and changing laws, rules and regulations, and difficulties understanding and ensuring compliance with
those laws by employees and business partners over whom ANGI Homeservices will exert no control; 

• compliance challenges due to different laws and regulatory environments, particularly in the case of privacy and data
security; 

• competitive environments that favor local businesses; 

• limitations on the level of intellectual property protection; and 

• trade sanctions, political unrest, terrorism, war and epidemics or the threat of any of these events.

        The occurrence of any or all of the events described above could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of
operations of ANGI Homeservices.

ANGI Homeservices faces operational and financial risks in connection with any future acquisitions.

        The HomeAdvisor Business has made numerous acquisitions in the past and ANGI Homeservices expects to seek potential
acquisition candidates to expand its business in the future. ANGI Homeservices may experience operational and financial challenges in
connection with historical and future acquisitions if it is unable to:

• properly value prospective acquisitions, especially those with limited operating histories; 

• successfully integrate the operations, as well as the accounting, financial controls, management information, technology,
human resources and other administrative systems, of acquired businesses with its existing operations and systems; 

• successfully identify and realize potential synergies among acquired and existing business; 

• retain or hire senior management and other key personnel at acquired businesses; and 

• successfully manage acquisition-related strain on its management, operations and financial resources.

        Furthermore, ANGI Homeservices may not be successful in addressing other challenges it may encounter in connection with
acquisitions. The anticipated benefits of one or more historical and/or future acquisitions may not be realized or the value of goodwill and
other intangible assets acquired could be impacted by one or more continuing unfavorable events or trends, which could result in
significant impairment charges. The occurrence of any these events could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition and
results of operations of ANGI Homeservices.

ANGI Homeservices may enter into a credit agreement which contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants that may limit its
flexibility in operating its businesses.

        ANGI Homeservices currently intends to enter into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as
administrative agent and certain lenders after the Closing. The Credit Agreement is expected to provide for a five-year term loan A facility
not to exceed $275 million, and to be guaranteed by ANGI Homeservice's wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries. It is expected to
be secured by substantially all assets of ANGI Homeservices and the guarantors, subject to certain exceptions to be agreed. The proceeds
of the Credit Agreement, if any, are expected to be used

to repay indebtedness outstanding to IAC and its subsidiaries, to pay fees and expenses in connection with the Merger and for general
corporate purposes, including working capital and dividends. While ANGI Homeservices currently intends to enter into the Credit
Agreement, it may determine not to do so. If ANGI Homeservices were to enter into the Credit Agreement following the Closing, the
Credit Agreement is expected to contain affirmative, negative and financial covenants that could limit the manner in which ANGI
Homeservices conducts its business, and ANGI Homeservices may be unable to expand or fully pursue its business strategies, engage in
favorable business activities, or finance future operations or capital needs. ANGI Homeservices' ability to comply with the covenants
under the Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond its control, and it may not be able to comply with those covenants. A
breach of any of the covenants contained in the Credit Agreement could result in a default under the Credit Agreement, which could cause
all of the outstanding indebtedness under the facility to become immediately due and payable. If ANGI Homeservices is unable to generate
sufficient cash to repay its debt obligations under the Credit Agreement when they become due and payable, either as when such
obligations become due, when they mature, or in the event of a default, ANGI Homeservices may not be able to obtain additional debt or
equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which may negatively impact its business, financial condition and results of operations.

ANGI Homeservices will depend on its key personnel.

        ANGI Homeservices' future success will depend upon its ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled
individuals, with the contributions of its senior management being especially critical to its success. Competition for well-qualified
employees is intense and ANGI Homeservices' ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, upon its ability to attract new employees
and retain existing employees of the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List. While the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List have
established, and ANGI Homeservices will establish, programs to attract new employees and provide incentives to retain existing
employees, particularly senior management, ANGI Homeservices can provide no assurances that it will be able to attract new employees
or retain the services of senior management or any other key employees in the future. Effective succession planning is also important to
ANGI Homeservices' future success. If ANGI Homeservices fails to ensure the effective transfer of senior management knowledge and
smooth transitions involving senior management across its various businesses, its ability to execute short- and long-term strategic,
financial and operating goals, as well as its business, financial condition and results of operations generally, could be adversely affected.

ANGI Homeservices may be subject to litigation, and adverse outcomes in such litigation could have an adverse effect on its business,
financial condition and results of operations.

        Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business have historically been, and ANGI Homeservices following the completion of the
Transactions may from time to time become, subject to litigation and various legal proceedings, including litigation and proceedings
related to intellectual property matters and privacy and consumer protection laws, that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or
for other relief or that might necessitate changes to their businesses or operations. The defense of these actions may be both time
consuming and expensive. ANGI Homeservices will evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of
unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, ANGI
Homeservices may establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as and when required or
appropriate. These assessments and estimates will be based on information available to management at the time of such assessment or
estimation and will involve a significant amount of judgment. As a result, actual outcomes or losses could differ materially from initial
assessments and estimates. ANGI Homeservices' failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or other legal proceeding could
result in liability that, to the extent not covered by its insurance, could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Table of Contents

ANGI Homeservices' amended and restated bylaws will provide that a state or federal court within Delaware will be the sole and
exclusive forum for certain disputes between ANGI Homeservices and its stockholders, which could limit stockholders' ability to obtain
the judicial forum of their choice for disputes with ANGI Homeservices or its current or former directors, officers or employees.

        The amended and rested bylaws of ANGI Homeservices will provide that unless ANGI Homeservices consents in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, a state court within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within Delaware has jurisdiction,
the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for all of the following: (i) any derivative action
or proceeding brought on behalf of ANGI Homeservices, (ii) any action asserting a claim for or based on breach of fiduciary duty owed by
any current or former director or officer or other employee of ANGI Homeservices to ANGI Homeservices or to its stockholders, (iii) any
action asserting a claim against ANGI Homeservices or any of its current or former directors, officers, or other employees pursuant to the
DGCL, its certificate of incorporation, its bylaws, (iv) any action asserting a claim relating to or involving ANGI Homeservices that is
governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or (v) any action asserting an "internal corporate claim," as defined under the DGCL.

        The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes
with ANGI Homeservices or its current or former directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against
ANGI Homeservices and its current or former directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of
forum provision contained in ANGI Homeservices' amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, ANGI
Homeservices may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm its business,
results of operations, and financial condition.

Risks Related to ANGI Homeservices' Ongoing Relationship with IAC Following the Completion of the Transactions

Following the completion of the Transactions, IAC will continue to control a substantial majority of the voting power of ANGI
Homeservices common stock and will have the ability to control the direction of the business of ANGI Homeservices.

        Following the completion of the Transactions, IAC is expected to hold Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices that, together with
Class A shares underlying equity awards in respect of HomeAdvisor (US) to be converted into awards in respect of ANGI Homeservices,
will represent between approximately 87% and 90% of the economic interest (on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury stock
method) and approximately 98% of the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices common stock, depending on the number of Angie's
List stockholders that elect to receive Cash Consideration. As long as IAC owns shares of the capital stock of ANGI Homeservices that
represent a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock of ANGI Homeservices, with limited exceptions for
certain class votes, IAC will be able to control any corporate action that requires a vote of ANGI Homeservices stockholders, regardless of
the vote of any other ANGI Homeservices stockholder. As a result, IAC will have the ability to control significant corporate activities of
ANGI Homeservices following the completion of the Transactions, including the following:

• the election of the ANGI Homeservices board of directors (subject to the provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement
concerning two ANGI-Designated Directors, as further described in the section entitled "Ancillary Agreements—Investor
Rights Agreement") and, through the ANGI Homeservices board of directors, decision-making with respect to its business
direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of its officers; 

• acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets, mergers or other business combinations;

Table of Contents

• issuances of shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock; 

• corporate opportunities that may be suitable for ANGI Homeservices and IAC, subject to the corporate opportunity
provisions in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of ANGI Homeservices, as further described in the
section entitled "Description of ANGI Homeservices Capital Stock"; 

• the financing or capitalization activities of ANGI Homeservices, including the issuance of additional debt and equity
securities, or the incurrence of other indebtedness generally; 

• the payment of dividends; and 

• the number of shares available for issuance under future equity incentive plans of ANGI Homeservices for prospective and
existing employees.

This voting control will limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and, as a result, ANGI Homeservices may
take actions that stockholders other than IAC do not view as beneficial. This voting control may also discourage transactions involving a
change of control of ANGI Homeservices, including transactions in which holders of Class A shares might otherwise receive a premium
for their shares.

        Even if IAC owns shares of ANGI Homeservices' capital stock that represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of
the outstanding capital stock of ANGI Homeservices, so long as IAC owns shares representing a significant percentage of the combined
voting power of ANGI Homeservices stockholders, IAC will have the ability to exert substantial influence on, and may even effectively
control, these significant corporate activities.

        In addition, pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement that ANGI Homeservices will enter into with IAC prior to the Closing, IAC
will have the right to maintain its level of ownership in ANGI Homeservices to the extent ANGI Homeservices issues additional shares of
its capital stock in the future and, pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement that ANGI Homeservices will enter into with IAC prior to
the Closing, IAC may receive payment for certain compensation expenses through receipt of additional shares of stock of ANGI
Homeservices. For a more complete summary of these agreements with IAC, see the section entitled "Ancillary Agreements."

        Until such time as IAC no longer controls or has the ability to exert substantial influence on ANGI Homeservices, ANGI
Homeservices will continue to face the risks described in this "Risk Factors" section relating to IAC's control of ANGI Homeservices and
the potential conflicts of interest between IAC and ANGI Homeservices.

The amended and restated certificate of incorporation of ANGI Homeservices could prevent it from benefiting from corporate
opportunities that might otherwise have been available to ANGI Homeservices.

        The amended and restated certificate of incorporation of ANGI Homeservices will include a "corporate opportunity" provision
pursuant to which ANGI Homeservices renounces any interests or expectancy in any potential transaction or matter that may constitute a
corporate opportunity for both IAC and ANGI Homeservices. This provision also includes a disclaimer that states that ANGI
Homeservices recognizes that (i) any of its directors or officers who are also officers, directors, employees or other affiliates of IAC or its
affiliates (other than ANGI Homeservices and its subsidiaries) and (ii) IAC itself will have no duty to offer or communicate information
regarding such a corporate opportunity to ANGI Homeservices. Generally, neither IAC nor the officers or directors of ANGI
Homeservices who are also officers or directors of IAC or its affiliates will be liable to ANGI Homeservices or any of its stockholders for
breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of the fact that any such person pursues or acquires any corporate opportunity for the account of
IAC or any of its

Table of Contents

affiliates, directs or transfers such corporate opportunity to IAC or any of its affiliates, or does not communicate information regarding
such corporate opportunity to ANGI Homeservices. The corporate opportunity provision may exacerbate conflicts of interest between IAC
and ANGI Homeservices because the provision effectively permits one of the directors or officers of ANGI Homeservices who also serves
as a director or officer of IAC to choose to direct a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of to ANGI Homeservices.

IAC's interests may conflict with the interests of ANGI Homeservices and the interests of the other stockholders of ANGI
Homeservices. Conflicts of interest between IAC and ANGI Homeservices could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to ANGI
Homeservices and the other stockholders of ANGI Homeservices.

        Various conflicts of interest between ANGI Homeservices and IAC could arise following the completion of the Transactions. It is
expected that upon the completion of the Transactions, five of ten of the directors of ANGI Homeservices will be individuals who are
currently (and are intended to remain) directors or executive officers of IAC or officers of its subsidiaries. Ownership interests of directors
or officers of IAC in the stock of ANGI Homeservices, the ownership of Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices by IAC, and ownership
interests of the directors and officers of ANGI Homeservices in the stock of IAC, or a person's service as either a director or officer of both
companies, could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when those directors and officers are faced with decisions
relating to ANGI Homeservices. These decisions could include:

• corporate opportunities; 

• the impact that operating decisions for ANGI Homeservices' business may have on IAC's consolidated financial
statements; 

• the impact that operating or capital decisions (including the incurrence of indebtedness) for ANGI Homeservices' business
may have on IAC's current or future indebtedness or the covenants under that indebtedness; 

• business combinations involving ANGI Homeservices; 

• the dividend policy of ANGI Homeservices; 

• management stock ownership; and 

• the intercompany services and agreements between IAC and ANGI Homeservices.

Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if ANGI Homeservices decides to enter into any new commercial arrangements with IAC in
the future or in connection with IAC's desire to enter into new commercial arrangements with third parties. Additionally, IAC may be
constrained by the terms of its debt instruments from taking actions, or permitting ANGI Homeservices to take actions that may be in the
best interests of ANGI Homeservices.

        Furthermore, disputes may arise between IAC and ANGI Homeservices relating to past relationships with the HomeAdvisor Business
and ongoing relationships with ANGI Homeservices, and these potential conflicts of interest may make it more difficult for ANGI
Homeservices to favorably resolve such disputes, including those related to:

• tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from the Transactions; 

• the nature, quality and pricing of services IAC agrees to provide to ANGI Homeservices; 

• sales or other disposal by IAC of all or a portion of its ownership interest in ANGI Homeservices; and 

• business combinations involving ANGI Homeservices.

ANGI Homeservices may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and even if it does, the resolution may be less favorable to ANGI
Homeservices than if it were dealing with an unaffiliated third party. While ANGI Homeservices is controlled by IAC, it may not have the
leverage to negotiate amendments to these agreements, if required, on terms as favorable to ANGI Homeservices as those it would
negotiate with an unaffiliated third party.

ANGI Homeservices will be a "controlled company" as defined in the NASDAQ Rules, and will rely on exemptions from certain
corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other companies.

        Upon completion of the Transactions, IAC will continue to own more than 50% of the combined voting power of the share capital of
ANGI Homeservices, which will thus be a "controlled company" under the rules and regulations of NASDAQ (the "NASDAQ Rules"). As
a "controlled company," ANGI Homeservices will be exempt from the obligation to comply with certain NASDAQ Rules related to
corporate governance, including the following requirements for which ANGI Homeservices expects to avail itself of the "controlled
company" exemption:

• that a majority of the board of directors of ANGI Homeservices be "independent directors," as defined under the NASDAQ
Rules; and 

• that the ANGI Homeservices board of directors have a nominating/governance committee that is composed entirely of
independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities.

        Accordingly, for so long as ANGI Homeservices is a "controlled company," to the extent it avails itself of these exemptions, you will
not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the
NASDAQ Rules. For further details, see the section entitled "Corporate Governance of ANGI Homeservices Following the Merger."

In order to preserve the ability of IAC to distribute its shares of the capital stock of ANGI Homeservices on a tax-free basis, ANGI
Homeservices may be prevented from pursuing opportunities to raise capital, acquire other businesses or provide equity incentives to
its employees, which could hurt its ability to grow.

        Under current laws, IAC must retain beneficial ownership of at least 80% of the combined voting power and 80% of each class of
non-voting capital stock, if any is outstanding, in order to effect a tax-free distribution of ANGI Homeservices shares held by IAC to IAC
stockholders. IAC has advised ANGI Homeservices that it does not have any present intention or plans to undertake such a tax-free
distribution. However, IAC currently intends to use its majority voting interest in ANGI Homeservices to retain its ability to engage in
such a transaction. This intention may cause IAC not to support transactions that ANGI Homeservices wishes to pursue that involve
issuing shares of ANGI Homeservices common stock, including for capital-raising purposes, as consideration for an acquisition or as
equity incentives to its employees. The inability to pursue such transactions may adversely affect the business, financial condition and
results of operations of ANGI Homeservices.

The agreements between ANGI Homeservices and IAC will require ANGI Homeservices to indemnify IAC for certain tax liabilities
and may limit ANGI Homeservices' ability to engage in desirable strategic or capital-raising transactions, including following any
distribution by IAC of the capital stock of ANGI Homeservices to IAC stockholders.

        Prior to or at the Effective Time, ANGI Homeservices will enter into a Tax Sharing Agreement with IAC. Under the Tax Sharing
Agreement, ANGI Homeservices generally will be responsible and will be required to indemnify IAC for (i) all taxes imposed with respect
to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of IAC or its subsidiaries that includes ANGI Homeservices or any of its subsidiaries
to the extent attributable to ANGI Homeservices or any of its subsidiaries (including certain taxes attributable to ANGI Homeservices,
HomeAdvisor (US), HomeAdvisor (International),

each of their respective subsidiaries and each other entity that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of ANGI Homeservices as of the Effective
Time, other than Angie's List and its subsidiaries (which are collectively referred to as the "HomeAdvisor Entities") for taxable periods (or
portions thereof) ending on or before the Effective Time), as determined under the Tax Sharing Agreement, and (ii) all taxes imposed with
respect to any consolidated, combined, unitary or separate tax returns of ANGI Homeservices or any of its subsidiaries. To the extent IAC
failed to pay taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of IAC or one of its subsidiaries that includes
ANGI Homeservices or any of its subsidiaries, the relevant taxing authority could seek to collect such taxes (including taxes for which
IAC is responsible under the Tax Sharing Agreement) from ANGI Homeservices or its subsidiaries.

        As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, IAC does not have a present plan or intention to undertake a tax-free spin-off of its
interest in ANGI Homeservices. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, ANGI Homeservices generally will be responsible for any taxes and
related amounts imposed on IAC or ANGI Homeservices (or their respective subsidiaries) that arise from the failure of a future spin-off of
IAC's retained interest in ANGI Homeservices to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
under Section 368(a)(1)(D) and/or Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, to the extent that the
failure to so qualify is attributable to (i) a breach of the relevant representations and covenants made by ANGI Homeservices in the Tax
Sharing Agreement or any representation letter provided in support of any tax opinion or ruling obtained by IAC with respect to the U.S.
federal income tax treatment of such spin-off, (ii) an acquisition of ANGI Homeservices' equity securities or assets or (iii) any other action
or failure to act by ANGI Homeservices after any such spin-off.

        To preserve the tax-free treatment of any potential future spin-off by IAC of its interest in ANGI Homeservices, the Tax Sharing
Agreement will restrict ANGI Homeservices and its subsidiaries, for the two-year period following any such spin-off, except in specific
circumstances, from: (i) entering into any transaction pursuant to which ANGI Homeservices stock would be acquired above a certain
threshold, (ii) merging, consolidating or liquidating, (iii) selling or transferring assets above certain thresholds, (iv) redeeming or
repurchasing stock (with certain exceptions), (v) altering the voting rights of ANGI Homeservices stock, (vi) taking or failing to take any
other action inconsistent with representations or covenants in any tax opinion or private letter ruling document or (vii) ceasing to engage in
any active trade or business as defined in the Code.

        The indemnity obligations and other limitations under the Tax Sharing Agreement could have an adverse effect on the business,
financial condition and results of operations of ANGI Homeservices. For a more complete description of the Tax Sharing Agreement, see
the section entitled "Ancillary Agreements—Tax Sharing Agreement."

Future sales or distributions of ANGI Homeservices shares by IAC could depress the price of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices.

        After the completion of the Transactions, IAC will have the right to sell or distribute to its stockholders all or a portion of the Class B
shares of ANGI Homeservices that IAC holds or Class A shares into which the Class B shares are convertible, including pursuant to one or
more registration statements under the Securities Act that IAC may require ANGI Homeservices to file or pursuant to Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act (after the applicable holding period) or otherwise. Although as of the date of this proxy
statement/prospectus IAC has advised ANGI Homeservices that it does not have any present intention or plans to undertake such a sale or
distribution, sales by IAC in the public market or distributions to its stockholders of substantial amounts of ANGI Homeservices stock in
the form of Class A shares or Class B shares, or the filing by ANGI Homeservices of a registration statement relating to a sale or other
disposition by IAC of a substantial amount of ANGI Homeservices stock, could depress the price of the ANGI Homeservices Class A
shares.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1491778/000104746917005453/a2233101zdefm14a.htm 65/344

        In addition, IAC will have the right, subject to certain conditions, to include its shares in other registration statements that ANGI
Homeservices may file. If IAC exercises these registration rights and sells all or a portion of its shares of capital stock of ANGI
Homeservices, the price of the ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock could decline.

The services that IAC will provide to ANGI Homeservices following the completion of the Transactions may not be sufficient to meet its
needs, which may result in increased costs and otherwise adversely affect its business.

        Historically, IAC has provided the HomeAdvisor Business with significant corporate and shared services related to corporate
functions such as executive oversight, risk management, information technology, accounting, audit, legal, investor relations, tax, treasury
and other services. Following completion of the Transactions, ANGI Homeservices expects IAC to continue to provide many of these
services in exchange for the fees specified in the Services Agreement, as further described in the section entitled "Ancillary Agreements—
Services Agreement." IAC will not be obligated to provide these services in a manner that differs from the nature of the services provided
to the HomeAdvisor Business during the 12 months prior to the Closing Date, and thus ANGI Homeservices may not be able to modify
these services in a manner desirable to it as a standalone public company. Further, if ANGI Homeservices no longer receives these services
from IAC due to the termination of the Services Agreement or otherwise, it may not be able to perform these services itself, or find
appropriate third-party arrangements at a reasonable cost, and the cost may be higher than that charged by IAC.

Risks Related to an Investment in Class A Shares of ANGI Homeservices

The multiclass structure of the capital stock of ANGI Homeservices has the effect of concentrating voting control with holders of its
Class B shares and limiting the ability of the holders of Class A shares to influence corporate matters.

        Each Class B share of ANGI Homeservices has ten votes per share, and each Class A share has one vote per share. Angie's List
stockholders who receive the Share Consideration in the Merger will receive Class A shares. Class C shares do not have any voting rights
except as required by the laws of Delaware, in which case, each Class C share will have one one-hundredth (1/100) of a vote per share.
Immediately following the Closing, depending on the number of Angie's List stockholders that elect to receive Cash Consideration, former
holders of Angie's List common stock and equity awards are expected to hold, in the aggregate, Class A shares representing between
approximately 10% (assuming Angie's List stockholders elect to receive the maximum aggregate Cash Consideration) and 13% (assuming
no Angie's List stockholders elect to receive Cash Consideration) of the economic interest in ANGI Homeservices common stock (on a
fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury stock method), and less than 2% of the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices
common stock, and IAC is expected to hold Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices which, together with Class A shares underlying equity
awards in respect of HomeAdvisor (US) to be converted into awards in respect of ANGI Homeservices, will represent between
approximately 87% and 90% of the economic interest (on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury stock method) and
approximately 98% of the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices common stock. There will be no shares of Class C common stock
outstanding immediately following the completion of the Transactions.

        Due to the ten-to-one voting ratio between the Class B shares and the Class A shares, IAC, as the holder of all of the outstanding
Class B shares, will continue to control a substantial majority of the combined voting power of the capital stock of ANGI Homeservices
immediately following the completion of the Transactions, and the holders of the outstanding Class B shares in the future may continue to
control a majority of the combined voting power of the capital stock of ANGI Homeservices even if and when the outstanding Class B
shares represent a small minority of the total outstanding equity of ANGI Homeservices. In addition, because the Class C common stock
carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of Class C shares, including in future

Table of Contents

stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could prolong the duration of IAC's current relative
ownership of the voting power of ANGI Homeservices and IAC's ability to elect the ANGI Homeservices directors and determine the
outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of ANGI Homeservices stockholders. This concentrated control will significantly limit the
ability of holders of Class A shares to influence corporate matters.

The difference in the voting rights of the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock may harm the value and liquidity of the
Class A common stock.

        The holders of Class B common stock will be entitled to ten votes per share and the holders of the Class A common stock will be
entitled to one vote per share. The difference in the voting rights of the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock could harm
the value of the Class A common stock to the extent that any investor or potential future purchaser of Class A common stock ascribes
value to the right of the holders of the Class B common stock to ten votes per share. The existence of two classes of common stock with
voting rights could result in less liquidity for either class of stock than if there were only one class of ANGI Homeservices common stock.
See the section entitled "Description of ANGI Homeservices Capital Stock" for descriptions of the Class A common stock and the Class B
common stock and the rights associated with each.

An active trading market for the Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices may not develop, and the absence of a reliably liquid market
may make it difficult for stockholders to sell their Class A shares and may negatively impact the prices at which Class A shares can be
sold.

        Prior to the completion of the Transactions, there will have been no public market for the Class A shares. ANGI Homeservices cannot
predict the extent to which investor interest in its Class A shares will lead to the development of an active trading market on NASDAQ or
how liquid that market might become following the completion of the Transactions. If liquidity and trading volume in the market for
Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices is low following the Transactions, this could adversely impact the trading price of Class A shares,
the ability of ANGI Homeservices to issue additional stock in the future and the ability of ANGI Homeservices stockholders to sell their
Class A shares at attractive prices if and when desired. Additionally, as of August 23, 2017, ownership of approximately 59% of the
outstanding Angie's List common stock was concentrated among a relatively small group of institutional stockholders (excluding shares
beneficially owned by Mr. Semler), as further described in the section entitled "Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and
Management of Angie's List." As such, assuming all such stockholders receive the Share Consideration in the Merger, ownership of the
outstanding Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices immediately following the Merger will be similarly concentrated. Concentrated
ownership of Class A shares may make an active, liquid public market less likely to develop, and less likely that a reliably liquid market
will be sustained in the future. An active, liquid public market for the Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices may not develop or be
sustained after the completion of the Transactions. If an active public market does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for
holders of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices to sell their shares at a price that is attractive to them, or at all.

The market price of ANGI Homeservices Class A shares may be volatile, and the value of the Class A shares could materially decline.

        Holders of Class A shares may not be able to sell their shares at or above the price at which they purchased the shares of Angie's List
common stock that are converted into Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices in the Merger. The price of Angie's List common stock has
fluctuated materially from time to time, and the price of ANGI Homeservices Class A shares may fluctuate materially following the
completion of the Merger. ANGI Homeservices cannot predict the prices at which its Class A shares will trade in any future period. In
addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or
disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm

the market price of the Class A shares, regardless of ANGI Homeservices' operating performance. In addition, the Class A share price may
be dependent upon the valuations and recommendations of the analysts who cover ANGI Homeservices, and if its results do not meet the
analysts' forecasts and expectations, the Class A share price could decline as a result of analysts lowering their valuations and
recommendations or otherwise.

Future sales of Class A shares in the public market could cause volatility in the price of the Class A shares or cause the share price to
fall.

        Sales of a substantial number of Class A shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the
market price of the Class A shares, and could impair ANGI Homeservices' ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity
securities. It is possible that a number of Angie's List stockholders who receive the Share Consideration in the Merger may seek to sell a
substantial number of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices shortly after the completion of the Merger, and a high volume of sales or
attempted sales within a short period of time, if it were to occur, is likely to negatively impact the price at which Class A shares trade.

The Class A shares to be received by Angie's List stockholders in connection with the Merger will have different rights from the
Angie's List common stock.

        Upon consummation of the Merger, Angie's List stockholders that receive the Share Consideration in the Merger will become ANGI
Homeservices' stockholders and their rights as stockholders will be governed by the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
the amended and restated bylaws of ANGI Homeservices and Delaware law. The existing rights associated with Angie's List common
stock are different from the rights associated with ANGI Homeservices common stock. For more information, see the sections entitled
"Description of ANGI Homeservices Capital Stock" and "Comparison of the Rights of Angie's List Stockholders and Holders of Class A
Shares of ANGI Homeservices."

ANGI Homeservices may not pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future and there can be no assurances that investors will
realize gains on the Class A shares.

        ANGI Homeservices has never declared or paid cash dividends on its capital stock, and ANGI Homeservices has not yet determined
whether, when and in what amounts it may pay cash dividends on its Class A common stock, Class B common stock or Class C common
stock (if any is then-outstanding) in the future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of the ANGI
Homeservices board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, and any future
indebtedness it may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors the ANGI Homeservices board of directors deems
relevant. See the section entitled "The Transactions—Dividend Policy of ANGI Homeservices." There can be no assurances regarding the
prices at which Class A shares will trade following the Merger, and the realization of any gains on the Class A shares by investors will
depend on the price at which the Class A shares can be sold in the marketplace.

Provisions in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws of ANGI Homeservices or Delaware law may
discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of ANGI Homeservices or changes in its management and, therefore, depress the
trading price of the Class A shares.

        Delaware corporate law and the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws of ANGI Homeservices contain
provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of

Table of Contents

ANGI Homeservices or changes in its management that the stockholders of ANGI Homeservices may deem advantageous, including
provisions which:

• authorize the issuance of "blank check" preferred stock that the board of directors of ANGI Homeservices could issue to
increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt; 

• limit the ability of ANGI Homeservices stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; 

• provide that certain litigation against ANGI Homeservices can only be brought in Delaware; and 

• provide that the ANGI Homeservices board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal the bylaws of
ANGI Homeservices.

Any provision of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws of ANGI Homeservices or Delaware law that has the
effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for the ANGI Homeservices stockholders to receive a
premium for their Class A shares, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for the Class A shares.

The multiclass structure of the capital stock of ANGI Homeservices may render the Class A shares ineligible for inclusion in certain
stock market indices, including the S&P Composite 1500 and its component indices and all indices managed by FTSE Russell.
Exclusion from these and potentially other stock market indices may adversely affect the price and liquidity of the Class A shares.

        Recently, certain operators of U.S. stock market indices have announced plans or adopted policies to exclude equity securities of
companies with multiple classes of outstanding publicly traded equity securities and/or companies with outstanding classes of publicly
traded equity securities that have no voting rights (or "low" voting rights, relative to another outstanding class of equity securities) from
their stock indices. On July 26, 2017, FTSE Russell, which manages multiple stock market indices (including many in the United States)
and is wholly owned by the London Stock Exchange Group, published a proposal to exclude from the indices it manages any company
with 5% or less of its voting rights (aggregated across all of its equity securities, including those that are not listed or trading) held by
"unrestricted (free-float) shareholders as defined by FTSE Russell." Following the Closing, IAC is expected to hold approximately 98% of
the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices common stock, and as such ANGI Homeservices Class A shares may not be eligible for
inclusion in any indices managed by FTSE Russell. Similarly, on July 31, 2017, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that it planned to
exclude companies with multiple share class structures (which would include ANGI Homeservices) from being added to the S&P
Composite 1500 and its component indices. In addition, similar policies may be announced or implemented in the future by other
operators of stock market indices. Absent a change in the total voting power in ANGI Homeservices represented by the Class A shares
(including as a result of any voluntary conversion by IAC of its Class B shares to Class A shares), any such changes in policy or index
selection criteria could render the Class A shares ineligible for inclusion in other stock market indices. Exclusion from stock market
indices could adversely affect the price and reduce the liquidity and demand for the Class A shares.

Other Risks Related to the Businesses of Angie's List

        In addition to the risks described above, you should read and consider the risk factors specific to the businesses of Angie's List, which
are also expected to affect ANGI Homeservices following the completion of the Transactions. These risks are described in Angie's List's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, as updated by any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-
Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by Angie's List, all of which are or will be filed with the SEC and are incorporated by reference
into this proxy statement/prospectus. See the section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information."

ANGIE'S LIST SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 

        This section contains information about the special meeting of Angie's List stockholders that has been called to consider and adopt
the Merger Agreement, to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation payable to certain executive officers of Angie's
List in connection with the Merger, and to approve the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of
the special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement.

        This proxy statement/prospectus is being furnished to the stockholders of Angie's List in connection with the solicitation of proxies
by the Angie's List board for use at the special meeting. Angie's List is first mailing this proxy statement/prospectus and accompanying
proxy card to its stockholders on or about August 30, 2017.

Date, Time and Place

        The special meeting will be held on Friday, September 29, 2017, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time at The Alexander, 333 S. Delaware St.,
Indianapolis, Indiana 46204, unless the special meeting is adjourned or postponed.

Purpose of the Special Meeting; Proposals

        At the special meeting, Angie's List stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon the following matters:

• a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; 

• a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation payable to certain executive officers of
Angie's List in connection with the Merger; and 

• a proposal to approve the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting if necessary or appropriate, including to
solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time
of the special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement.

Recommendation of the Angie's List Board of Directors

        The Angie's List board has (i) unanimously determined that the Merger Agreement and the Merger are advisable and in the best
interests of Angie's List and its stockholders, (ii) adopted, approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the Merger,
(iii) recommended that the Angie's List stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and (iv) directed that the Merger Agreement be

        The Angie's List board unanimously recommends that Angie's List stockholders vote:

• "FOR" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement; 

• "FOR" the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation payable to certain executive officers
of Angie's List in connection with the Merger; and 

• "FOR" the proposal to approve the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting if necessary or appropriate,
including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient
votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement.

See the sections entitled "The Transactions—Joint Reasons of Angie's List and IAC for the Transactions" and "—Angie's List's Reasons
for the Transactions; Recommendation of the Angie's List Board of Directors."

        Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares of Angie's List common stock you own. The Merger cannot be
consummated unless the Merger Agreement is adopted by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Angie's
List common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. If you abstain from voting, fail to cast your vote, in person or by proxy, or fail to
give voting instructions to your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, it will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement.

        Angie's List stockholders should carefully read this proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety for more detailed information
concerning the Transactions. In addition, Angie's List stockholders are directed to the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Annex B to
this proxy statement/prospectus.

        Adoption of the Merger Agreement is subject to a vote by Angie's List stockholders separate from the vote on approval, on an
advisory (non-binding) basis, of the compensation payable to certain executive officers of Angie's List in connection with the Merger.
Approval of the compensation arrangements is not a condition to completion of the Merger.

Record Date; Stockholders Entitled to Vote

        Only holders of record of shares of Angie's List common stock at the close of business on the record date, which is August 25, 2017,
will be entitled to vote at the special meeting. Each outstanding share of Angie's List common stock held as of the close of business on the
record date entitles its holder to cast one vote on each proposal to be voted on at the special meeting. As of the close of business on the
record date, there were 61,292,181 shares of Angie's List common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.

Voting by Directors and Executive Officers of Angie's List

        As of the close of business on the record date, Angie's List's directors, executive officers and their respective affiliates owned and
were entitled to vote 7,436,575 shares of Angie's List common stock. This represents approximately 12% of the outstanding shares of
Angie's List common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting. Completion of the Merger is conditioned upon, among other things, the
adoption of the Merger Agreement by stockholders of Angie's List. Adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Angie's List common stock. Angie's List currently expects that the Angie's List directors
and executive officers will vote their shares of Angie's List common stock in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and the
other proposals to be considered at the special meeting, although none of them is obligated to do so.

Quorum; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

        A quorum is the minimum number of shares required to be present at the special meeting for the meeting to be properly held under
the bylaws of Angie's List and Delaware law. The presence, in person or represented by proxy, of a majority of all issued and outstanding
shares of common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting will constitute a quorum at the meeting. In the absence of a quorum, the
chairperson of the special meeting or a majority in voting interest of the holders of Angie's List common stock present in person or
represented by proxy at the special meeting at that time and entitled to vote at the special meeting will have the power to adjourn the
special meeting until a quorum is present. Based on the number of shares of Angie's List common stock issued and outstanding as of the
close of business on the record date for the special meeting, 30,646,091 shares of Angie's List common stock will be required to achieve a
quorum.

Table of Contents

        Holders of shares of Angie's List common stock present in person at the special meeting but not voting, and shares of Angie's List
common stock for which Angie's List has received proxies indicating that their holders have abstained, will be counted as present at the
special meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is established.

        Under the rules that govern brokers who have record ownership of shares that are held in "street name" for their clients, the beneficial
owners of the shares, brokers have discretion to vote these shares on routine matters but not on non-routine matters. The proposals to be
voted on at the special meeting are not considered routine matters. Accordingly, brokers will not have discretionary voting authority to
vote on the matters at the special meeting and, without instruction from the beneficial owner of the shares of Angie's List common stock
held by that broker, will not be permitted to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the proposal to approve, on an advisory
(non-binding) basis, the compensation payable to certain executive officers of Angie's List in connection with the Merger or the proposal
to adjourn or postpone the special meeting if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement.
Accordingly, shares of Angie's List common stock beneficially owned that have been designated on proxy cards by the broker (or bank or
other nominee) as not voted on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, which are referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as
"broker non-votes," will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and to the extent a
broker (or bank or other nominee) has caused your shares to be represented at the special meeting, the proposal to approve on an advisory
(non-binding) basis, the compensation payable to certain executive officers of Angie's List in connection with the Merger. Broker non-
votes will have no effect on the proposal to approve one or more adjournments or postponements of the special meeting.

        Your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee will only be permitted to vote your shares of Angie's List common stock if you instruct
your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee regarding the voting of your shares of Angie's List common stock.

Required Vote

        Adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Angie's List common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote on this proposal. Accordingly, your failure to submit a proxy card or to vote in person at the special
meeting, your abstention from voting or your failure to give voting instructions to your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee if you hold
your shares in "street name" through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the
proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

        Approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the compensation payable to certain executive officers of Angie's List in connection
with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Angie's List common stock present, in person or
represented by proxy, at the special meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal. If your shares are not in attendance at the special
meeting, they will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal; however, if a quorum is present and you submit a proxy or vote in
person at the special meeting and indicate "ABSTAIN," your abstention will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" this proposal.

        Approval of the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting (if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional
proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt
the Merger Agreement) requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Angie's List common stock present, in person
or represented by proxy, at the special meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal. If your shares are not in attendance at the special
meeting, they will have no effect on the outcome of any vote to

adjourn or postpone the special meeting; however, if a quorum is present and you submit a proxy or vote in person at the special meeting
and indicate "ABSTAIN," your abstention will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" this proposal.

How to Vote

        Angie's List stockholders may vote using any of the following methods:

By Telephone or on the Internet

        Angie's List stockholders can vote by calling the toll-free telephone number on their proxy card. Please have your proxy card handy
when you call. Easy-to-follow voice prompts allow you to vote your shares and confirm that your instructions have been properly
recorded.

        The website for internet voting is www.investorvote.com/ANGI. Please have your proxy card handy when you go online. As with
telephone voting, you can confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded.

        Telephone and internet voting facilities for Angie's List stockholders of record will be available 24 hours a day beginning on or about
August 30, 2017, and will close at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on September 28, 2017. The availability of telephone and internet voting for
beneficial owners will depend on the voting processes of your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee. Therefore, Angie's List recommends
that you follow the voting instructions in the materials you receive.

By Mail

        Angie's List stockholders may complete, sign and date the proxy card or voting instruction card mailed to them and return it in the
prepaid envelope.

In Person at the Special Meeting

        Angie's List stockholders as of the close of business on the record date may vote in person at the special meeting. You may also be
represented by another person at the special meeting if you execute a proper proxy designating that person. If you are a beneficial owner of
Angie's List shares, you must obtain a legal proxy from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee and present it to the inspectors of
election with your ballot to be able to vote at the special meeting.

Voting of Proxies

        Shares will be voted in accordance with the instructions provided by an Angie's List stockholder who has voted by internet,
by telephone or by completing, signing, dating and mailing a proxy card or voting instruction card. If you are an Angie's List
stockholder of record and you sign, date and return your proxy card but do not indicate how you want to vote or do not indicate
that you wish to abstain, your shares will be voted "FOR" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, "FOR" the proposal to
approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation payable to certain executive officers of Angie's List in connection with
the Merger and "FOR" the proposal to adjourn or postpone the special meeting if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit
additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special
meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement, and in the discretion of the proxyholders on any other matter that may properly come
before the meeting at the discretion of the Angie's List board.

Revoking Your Proxy

        Angie's List stockholders may revoke a proxy at any time before it is voted at the special meeting. To do this, you must:

• enter a new vote by telephone or over the internet by the date and time indicated on the applicable proxy card or voting
instruction card; 

• deliver another duly executed proxy card or voting instruction card bearing a later date to the addressee named in the proxy
card or voting instruction card; 

• provide written notice of the revocation to Angie's List's Corporate Secretary at 1030 East Washington Street, Indianapolis,
Indiana 46202; or 

• attend the special meeting and vote in person (your attendance at the meeting will not, by itself, revoke your proxy; to do
so you must vote in person at the meeting).

If your shares are held in "street name," you must contact your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to revoke and vote your proxy. If
you have questions about how to vote or revoke your proxy, you should contact Angie's List's proxy solicitor, Innisfree M&A Incorporated
at (888) 750-5834 (toll-free) or (212) 750-5833 (collect).

Attending the Special Meeting

        Angie's List stockholders as of the close of business on the record date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the special
meeting. If you hold shares of Angie's List common stock in your name as a stockholder of record and you wish to attend the special
meeting, you must present evidence of your stock ownership, such as your most recent account statement, at the special meeting. You
should also bring valid picture identification.

        If your shares of Angie's List common stock are held in "street name" in a stock brokerage account or otherwise by a bank, brokerage
firm or other nominee and you wish to attend the special meeting, you need to bring a copy of a bank or brokerage statement to the special
meeting reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date. You should also bring valid picture identification. Please note that if you
plan to attend the special meeting in person and would like to vote at the special meeting, you will need to bring a legal proxy from your
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee as explained above.

Adjournments and Postponements

        Although it is not currently expected, the special meeting may be adjourned or postponed for the purpose of, among other things,
soliciting additional proxies. Angie's List may adjourn the special meeting without notice if announced at the special meeting at which the
adjournment is taken and if the adjournment is to a date that is not greater than 30 days after the original date fixed for the special meeting
and no new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting. Any signed proxies received by Angie's List prior to the special meeting in
which no voting instructions are provided on such matter will be voted "FOR" the adjournment or postponement of the special meeting if
necessary or appropriate. Any adjournment or postponement of the special meeting will allow Angie's List stockholders who have already
sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the special meeting as adjourned or postponed.

        If, at the special meeting, the number of shares of Angie's List common stock present in person or represented by proxy and voting in
favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is not sufficient to approve that proposal, Angie's List expects to move to adjourn the
special meeting in order to enable the Angie's List board to solicit additional proxies for the adoption of the Merger Agreement. In that
event, Angie's List will ask its stockholders to vote only upon the adjournment

proposal, and not the Merger Agreement proposal. The adjournment proposal relates to any adjournment or postponement of the special
meeting if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there
are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement. Angie's List retains full authority to the extent
set forth in its bylaws and Delaware law to adjourn the special meeting for any other purpose, or to postpone the special meeting before it
is convened, without the consent of any Angie's List stockholders.

Solicitation of Proxies

        Angie's List is soliciting proxies for the special meeting from Angie's List stockholders. Angie's List has also retained Innisfree M&A
Incorporated to solicit proxies for the special meeting from Angie's List stockholders for a fee of approximately $20,000, plus reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses. Angie's List will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from Angie's List stockholders, and Angie's List will pay

Stockholder List

        A list of Angie's List stockholders entitled to vote at the special meeting will be available for examination by any Angie's List
stockholder at the special meeting. At least ten days prior to the date of the special meeting, this stockholder list will be available for

will be converted into the right to receive, at the holder's election (i) in the case of a share of Angie's List common stock with respect to
which an election to receive a Class A share of ANGI Homeservices has been properly made and not revoked or lost, one Class A share

Background of the Transactions

        The Angie's List board of directors regularly evaluates the strategic direction and ongoing business plan of Angie's List with a view
toward strengthening Angie's List's business and enhancing stockholder value. As part of this evaluation, the Angie's List board of
directors, from time to time, has considered various potential strategic alternatives for Angie's List, including continuation as a standalone
enterprise, potential strategic alliances and other commercial arrangements, modifications to its strategy and direction, strategic mergers
and acquisitions and other business combinations and/or a possible sale of Angie's List, including the possibility of a combination with
IAC's HomeAdvisor business.

        Angie's List announced in September 2015 that it had named Scott Durchslag as its new Chief Executive Officer. In October 2015,
under the direction of Mr. Durchslag, Angie's List began a comprehensive operational review to develop a new strategic plan, with
objectives of accelerating revenue growth, improving operational execution and improving profitability and cash flow. Among the
initiatives to be examined, Angie's List cited identification of cost reductions, redesign of the sales force, improving marketing execution,
scaling the Angie's List next generation operating platform, releasing a new service provider mobile application and improving execution
in e-commerce.

        On October 5, 2015, Joey Levin, the Chief Executive Officer of IAC, wrote to John Chuang, Angie's List's Chairman of the board of
directors at that time, indicating IAC's interest in exploring a strategic transaction involving Angie's List. On October 9, 2015, after
discussion with the Angie's List board of directors, Mr. Durchslag, on behalf of Angie's List, contacted Mr. Levin to inform him that if
IAC were to articulate a specific proposal regarding the terms of a potential transaction, Mr. Durchslag would discuss it with the Angie's
List board of directors but, absent a specific proposal, Angie's List would remain focused on improving operational execution rather than
diverting resources to explore a possible transaction. In response, Mr. Levin requested a meeting with Angie's List management and told
Mr. Durchslag that after such meeting was held, IAC would be in a position to deliver a specific proposal to Angie's List. Mr. Durchslag
informed Mr. Levin that he would formally reply to IAC's proposal by letter and would also seek to find a suggested time for the
management teams of IAC and Angie's List to meet. Later that afternoon, Mr. Levin received a letter from Mr. Durchslag confirming
receipt of IAC's October 5, 2015 letter, requesting a clearly articulated proposal from IAC with respect to value, deal structure and form of
consideration, suggesting a meeting later that month between the management teams of IAC and Angie's List and requesting the
negotiation of a non-disclosure agreement. The letter also noted that given the work ahead for Angie's List management in executing
Angie's List's standalone strategic plan, Mr. Durchslag believed that the Angie's List board of directors would not support the diversion of
resources to explore a potential transaction with IAC absent a specific proposal from IAC.

        On October 13, 2015, Mr. Durchslag contacted Mr. Levin and agreed during this exchange to meet on October 23, 2015.

        On October 23, 2015, Mr. Durchslag and Thomas R. Fox, the Chief Financial Officer of Angie's List, met Mr. Levin and Mark Stein,
Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer of IAC at that time, for dinner in Chicago. At the meeting, the representatives of IAC
expressed IAC's interest in exploring a potential acquisition of Angie's List for $8.50 per share in cash and also indicated IAC's
willingness to explore a combination of Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor business in an all-stock transaction if that would be of interest
to the Angie's List board of directors. The attendees discussed

IAC's view of the potential strategies that the combined company might pursue and the potential operational benefits of a combination.
The closing price of Angie's List common stock on October 23, 2015 was $6.94 per share.

        On November 3, 2015, Mr. Durchslag reported IAC's expression of interest and the meeting in Chicago to the Angie's List board of
directors at a meeting attended by Angie's List management and representatives of Sidley Austin, legal counsel to Angie's List, and BofA
Merrill Lynch, one of Angie's List's financial advisors. After discussing IAC's expression of interest, the Angie's List board of directors
determined that the Angie's List board should fully evaluate the strategic plan being prepared by Angie's List management, and share that
plan with Angie's List stockholders, before deciding whether to pursue a transaction with IAC or any other party and instructed
Mr. Durchslag to tell Mr. Levin that Angie's List was not interested in pursuing the proposed transaction with IAC at this time. After the
meeting, Mr. Durchslag communicated the Angie's List board of directors' decision to Mr. Levin.

        On November 11, 2015, IAC submitted to the Angie's List board of directors and substantially simultaneously publicly announced via
a press release a proposal to acquire Angie's List for $8.75 per share in cash. IAC also indicated its willingness to consider a combination
of Angie's List with the HomeAdvisor business through a tax-free stock-for-stock exchange. The closing price of Angie's List common
stock on November 10, 2015, the last full trading day before IAC's public announcement, was $7.84 per share.

        On November 17, 2015, Angie's List delivered a written response to IAC, which Angie's List substantially simultaneously published
via a press release, stating that after a comprehensive review, conducted in consultation with independent financial and legal advisors, the
Angie's List board of directors had determined that it was premature to conclude that a strategic transaction was in the best interests of
Angie's List stockholders, and concluded that the proposal by IAC undervalued Angie's List and its long-term standalone prospects. The
Angie's List board of directors reiterated that it believed that it should have the opportunity to fully evaluate the strategic plan being
prepared by Angie's List management and share that plan with Angie's List stockholders before deciding whether to engage in a
transaction with IAC or any other party. There were no further contacts between IAC and Angie's List concerning a potential business
combination transaction in the months that followed. On March 3, 2016, Angie's List held an "Investor Day" in New York City at which it
unveiled its new three-phase strategic plan. The first phase, to be executed over the remainder of 2016, included adoption of a new
member pricing strategy, including a basic free membership tier intended to increase membership and member engagement, introduction
of new member products and increased operational effectiveness across information technology, marketing and sales. The second phase of
the plan, to be executed during 2017 and 2018, focused on improving service provider offerings and increasing Angie's List's e-commerce
business. The third phase, to be executed after 2018, was to expand the Angie's List business into adjacent markets. Angie's List noted at
that time that the plan was expected to involve substantial near-term investment coupled with a decline in membership revenue resulting
from the new membership pricing structure, and that returns on Angie's List's investment in the form of improved operating results would
likely not be realized before 2017.

        During the second and third calendar quarters of 2016, Angie's List began to roll out the first phase of the strategic plan, including
making service provider reviews available to members free of charge, introducing a new tiered membership plan and migrating to its new
technology platform. During this period, Angie's List management regularly updated the Angie's List board of directors on management's
progress in executing the new strategic plan as well as Angie's List's financial condition and operating results. In that context, the Angie's
List board of directors regularly evaluated Angie's List's overall prospects, liquidity requirements for the strategic plan and potential costs
and benefits of pursuing a major strategic transaction such as a merger or acquisition of Angie's List in order to enhance stockholder value.

        At a meeting of the Angie's List board of directors on October 6, 2016, which was also attended by Angie's List management and a
representative of Sidley Austin, the Angie's List board of directors discussed, among other matters, various potential paths to enhance
stockholder value, including by reducing expenses and investment, raising additional capital to increase investment under the new strategic
plan and exploring potential strategic alternatives (including a possible sale of Angie's List). The representative of Sidley Austin advised
the Angie's List board of directors on the fiduciary duties of the members of the Angie's List board of directors' regarding its potential
exploration of these alternatives. Following discussion, the Angie's List board of directors approved the formation of a committee of the
Angie's List board of directors having the authority to examine various potential strategic options and consider financial advisors, with
George Bell, Thomas Evans, Dave Mullen and Eric Semler serving as members of this newly created Strategic Advisory Committee (the
"Committee").

        The Committee's first meeting was held on October 11, 2016. Also attending was Shannon Shaw, General Counsel of Angie's List
and additional members of Angie's List management. Among other initial matters, the Committee discussed the process for selecting
financial advisors to assist in the exploration of potential strategic alternatives.

        On October 17, 2016, at a meeting of the Angie's List board of directors, which was also attended by Angie's List management and a
representative of Sidley Austin, the Committee updated the Angie's List board of directors on its progress, including the financial advisor
selection process. The Committee recommended, and the Angie's List board of directors concurred, that both Allen & Company and BofA
Merrill Lynch (collectively, the "Financial Advisors") be engaged to assist Angie's List in a review and potential pursuit of strategic
alternatives. Thereafter, Angie's List engaged the Financial Advisors.

        The Committee held three meetings between October 20 and October 31, 2016, at which Angie's List management and
representatives of the Financial Advisors were present, and during which various process-related matters were discussed, including
potential acquirors of Angie's List (which included both strategic counterparties and financial sponsors), the process for contacting
potential acquirors and the appropriate time and method for announcing the Angie's List board of directors' decision to explore potential
strategic alternatives.

        When announcing its third quarter 2016 financial results on November 1, 2016, Angie's List stated that it was focused on
opportunities to accelerate growth and, in addition to continuing to execute on a turnaround plan, had determined to explore strategic
alternatives to achieve the full potential of its new platform. Angie's List also announced its engagement of the Financial Advisors to assist
Angie's List in exploring these strategic opportunities.

        Beginning on November 15, 2016, at the direction of Angie's List, the Financial Advisors began to contact 62 potential acquirors,
including 51 strategic parties and 11 financial sponsors. The Committee held a meeting on November 16, 2016, which was also attended
by Angie's List management and representatives of the Financial Advisors. At the Committee's request, the Financial Advisors briefed the
Committee on the initial outreach to potential acquirors, the preparation of management presentations and related matters, and the
Committee provided instruction regarding the same. The Committee engaged in additional discussion regarding interested potential
acquirors, the timing for a potential transaction and the scheduling of introductory meetings over the coming months.

        As part of the outreach to potential acquirors on behalf of Angie's List, a representative of Allen & Company contacted Mr. Levin on
November 16, 2016. Mr. Levin and the representative of Allen & Company spoke on November 18, 2016 whereby, in accordance with the
directives of the Angie's List board of directors, IAC was invited to participate in Angie's List's strategic alternatives review process.
Mr. Levin, on behalf of IAC, expressed interest in participating. In accordance with the directives of Angie's List's board of directors, the
representative of Allen & Company noted that IAC would be required to execute Angie's List's non-disclosure agreement prior to
receiving information,

and Mr. Levin in response requested that Angie's List's draft non-disclosure agreement be sent to IAC for review. Later that afternoon, IAC
received Angie's List's draft non-disclosure agreement, which Angie's List and IAC negotiated over the ensuing weeks.

        On November 23, 2016, the Angie's List board of directors held a meeting also attended by Angie's List management and
representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial Advisors during which the Angie's List board of directors discussed certain financial
information prepared by management both for purposes of Angie's List's budgeting process and evaluation of Angie's List's execution of
the turnaround plan and to be provided to potential acquirors, and provided guidance to management and the Committee for finalizing the
strategic plan. Management reviewed the work undertaken to prepare such information and related assumptions. Mr. Bell and
representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial Advisors also updated the Angie's List board of directors on the work of the Committee
and potential next steps.

        The Committee held a meeting on December 5, 2016, which was also attended by Angie's List management and representatives of the
Financial Advisors. The Committee received and approved the updated strategic plan from management and received an update from the
Financial Advisors as to the status of the third-party solicitation process. The Committee also approved providing certain materials,
including management presentations, to interested parties that had executed non-disclosure agreements and allowing such parties to
conduct due diligence reviews of Angie's List and its business.

        Beginning on December 6, 2016 and continuing through May 1, 2017, a number of interested parties (including IAC) engaged in a
due diligence review of Angie's List. Non-disclosure agreements were executed with 28 parties, including IAC (on December 13, 2016),
and 13 of such parties (which did not include IAC) attended separate presentations by Angie's List management.

        At an Angie's List board of directors meeting on December 13, 2016, which was also attended by Angie's List management and
representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial Advisors, the Angie's List board of directors received an update on the progress of the
third-party solicitation process and discussed potential next steps with respect to the interested parties. A representative of Sidley Austin
further discussed with the Angie's List board of directors the Angie's List board of directors' fiduciary duties in connection with a sale
process and reviewed a proposed form of merger agreement that could be provided to potential acquirors, which form had been circulated
to the Angie's List board of directors in advance of the meeting. At the meeting, management reviewed with the Angie's List board of
directors Angie's List's fourth quarter financial results and operating plan for 2017.

        The Committee met on January 2, 2017, with Angie's List management and representatives of the Financial Advisors present, and
received an update from the Financial Advisors regarding the third-party solicitation process, including summaries of management
presentation meetings previously held with potentially interested acquirors. The Committee discussed setting appropriate deadlines for the
submission of initial indications of interest. The Committee also discussed and approved the content of the first round bid instruction letter
to be provided to parties that had executed a non-disclosure agreement and indicated an interest in pursuing an acquisition of Angie's List.
This instruction letter, which set an initial bid deadline of January 18, 2017, was sent over the next few days to the 27 parties that had
expressed an interest in exploring a potential transaction with Angie's List, including IAC. Management also updated the Committee
regarding certain matters related to Angie's List's business. On January 10, 2017, the Angie's List board of directors held a regularly
scheduled meeting, which was also attended by Angie's List management and representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial Advisors.
Among other matters covered at the meeting, the Financial Advisors reviewed the status of the outreach to, and discussions with, potential
acquirors and discussed with the Angie's List board of directors certain market and financial matters relating to Angie's List and a potential
transaction and potential next steps in the process. At the meeting, management reviewed with the Angie's List board of directors Angie's
List's operating plan and financial outlook. The Angie's List board of directors and

management discussed the assumptions underlying the plan and outlook as well as member engagement, the service provider value
proposition, operating margin efficiencies, investment focus and deliverables. Given Angie's List's financial outlook as discussed at the
meeting, including with respect to member engagement, the service provider value proposition, operating margin efficiencies and
investment focus and deliverables, it was determined that, absent additional financing or a potential sale transaction, Angie's List would
not be expected to fully execute its operating plan, but would instead require substantial reductions in its cost structure.

        On January 18, 2017, a potential strategic acquiror (which is referred to in this section as "Company A") submitted a preliminary
indication of interest that contemplated a combination of Company A with Angie's List in which Angie's List stockholders in the aggregate
would receive, upon consummation of the transaction, 43% of the combined company's outstanding common stock. Also on January 18,
2017, representatives of IAC informed representatives of the Financial Advisors that, given a lack of sufficient due diligence materials
provided by Angie's List, IAC would not be submitting a preliminary indication of interest by the requested deadline.

        On January 20, 2017, at the direction of Angie's List, representatives of the Financial Advisors spoke with representatives of
Company A in order to clarify the terms of its proposal and to request financial information regarding Company A's business, including
certain financial projections.

        On January 23, 2017, the Committee held a meeting with Angie's List management and representatives of Sidley Austin and the
Financial Advisors present. The Financial Advisors updated the Committee as to the third-party solicitation process and the attendees
discussed the four parties that were then actively pursuing a potential acquisition of Angie's List pursuant to the process established by
Angie's List, which were IAC, Company A, and two additional potential strategic acquirors (which are referred to in this section as
"Company B" and "Company C"). The reasons given by other, previously interested parties for having elected not to continue to
participate in the process were also discussed. These stated reasons included, among other things, the relevant counterparty's inability to
realize synergies by acquiring Angie's List; competing internal initiatives undertaken or expected to be undertaken by the counterparty; the
counterparty's decision that acquiring Angie's List was not consistent with the counterparty's strategic focus; and, particularly in the case of
the financial sponsors that previously expressed interest as potential acquirors, the perception of these potential acquirors that Angie's List
was too early in the ongoing process of transitioning its business model for a potential acquiror to formulate and support a compelling
leveraged buyout model for an acquisition of Angie's List given the risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing transformation of
its business. The Committee discussed Company A's indication of interest and potential responses, as well as potential next steps. The
Committee directed management and the Financial Advisors to seek greater clarity from Company A as to the structure and terms of its
proposal, to continue to encourage Company B and Company C to submit indications of interest, and to provide additional requested
information to, and continue discussions with, IAC.

        The next day, on January 24, 2017, Company B submitted a preliminary indication of interest reflecting a proposed purchase price for
all of the outstanding shares of Angie's List common stock in the range of $8.65 to $8.95 per share in cash.

        On January 26, 2017, the Committee held a meeting with Angie's List management and a representative of Sidley Austin present.
During this meeting, management reviewed with the Committee further information and considerations regarding strategic priorities for
Angie's List and its business and associated capital requirements. Risks and potential benefits of various operating scenarios were
discussed as well as the potential implementation of various initiatives. After discussion, the Committee instructed management to
continue to develop an operating plan reflecting the alternative operating strategy discussed at the meeting for further consideration by the
Angie's List board of directors.

        Later on January 26, 2017, the Committee held another meeting, with Angie's List management and representatives of Sidley Austin
and the Financial Advisors present, during which meeting Company B's proposal was discussed. The Committee directed the Financial
Advisors to inform Company B that it would need to increase its proposed purchase price, but would be permitted to continue its due
diligence review and discussions with Angie's List to validate a higher purchase price and to continue to participate in the process. The
Financial Advisors conveyed that message to Company B later that evening as instructed. In addition, during the Committee meeting, the
Committee discussed the status of conversations with Company A, and determined that it would require further financial information
regarding Company A before the Committee would respond to Company A's proposal. Also discussed at the meeting were a request by
Company C for Angie's List's strategic rationale for a potential combination with Company C and the parties' efforts to schedule a meeting
of the representatives of Angie's List and Company C. With respect to IAC, the Committee discussed various potential responses to IAC's
request to receive more information about Angie's List before submitting a preliminary indication of interest. The Committee instructed
the Financial Advisors to continue discussions with IAC while seeking to further evaluate the two proposals received to date.

        On January 31, 2017, the Angie's List board of directors held a meeting, also attended by Angie's List management and
representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial Advisors. A member of the Committee updated the Angie's List board of directors on
the work undertaken to date by the Committee. The Financial Advisors then updated the Angie's List board of directors as to the third-
party solicitation process, including with respect to the four interested parties that remained in the process and the reasons stated by other
potential acquirors for declining to participate further in the process as discussed with the Committee at its January 23, 2017 meeting. As
part of the discussion at this meeting, the Angie's List board of directors, management and Financial Advisors discussed the perspectives
of potential financial sponsor acquirors, and the potential ability of Angie's List to take certain operational actions that might increase the
attractiveness of Angie's List to financial sponsors as an acquisition target. Also at this meeting, management reviewed and discussed with
the Angie's List board of directors a revised operational plan for Angie's List as a standalone company reflecting a narrowed operational
focus, as requested by the Angie's List board at prior meetings. The attendees also discussed, among other things, management's views of
the potential impact of adopting such a plan on the near-term operations and financial condition and long-term prospects of Angie's List, as
well as the timing and desirability of adopting this revised operational plan and related implications.

        Also on January 31, 2017, Company A and Company B were given access to an online data room prepared by Angie's List that
contained confidential information about Angie's List intended to allow a further due diligence review of Angie's List and its business.

        From February 7 through February 14, 2017, Angie's List management held due diligence meetings (both telephonic and in person)
with Company A, Company B and Company C. Representatives of the Financial Advisors also attended these meetings. Also during this
period, the Committee held a meeting on February 10, 2017, at which management was present, to discuss these due diligence meetings.
The Committee directed Angie's List management to provide additional due diligence information to IAC pursuant to its request.

        Beginning in early to mid-February of 2017, Company C ceased active engagement in the process, but Company C did not formally
withdraw or provide any reason for discontinuing discussions with Angie's List, notwithstanding multiple efforts to keep Company C
engaged.

        On February 16, 2017, Mr. Levin spoke with a representative of Allen & Company to express IAC's interest in pursuing a stock-for-
stock combination of Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor business. In accordance with Angie's List's directives, the representative of
Allen & Company indicated that the Angie's List board of directors might be willing to consider a stock-for-stock combination but was
also continuing to consider alternative proposals, and suggested that representatives of Angie's List meet

with representatives of IAC and the HomeAdvisor business to discuss the potential benefits of combining Angie's List and the
HomeAdvisor business and the outlook for such a combined company.

        On February 23, 2017, representatives of IAC held a conference call with the Committee and representatives of the Financial
Advisors and presented IAC's views on the benefits of combining Angie's List with IAC's HomeAdvisor business. At the end of this
presentation, IAC indicated its willingness to pursue a potential transaction whereby Angie's List would be combined with IAC's
HomeAdvisor business in North America in a stock-for-stock combination that would result in Angie's List securityholders owning, upon
consummation of the transaction, 10% of the combined company on a cash-free, debt-free basis, with governance arrangements for the
combined company to be determined.

        On February 28, 2017, the Committee held a meeting, which was also attended by Angie's List management and representatives of
Sidley Austin and the Financial Advisors. The Financial Advisors discussed with the Committee IAC's proposal and certain financial
matters regarding IAC's proposed transaction and the HomeAdvisor business, noting that while IAC publicly reported some financial
information regarding the HomeAdvisor segment of its business, IAC had not provided sufficient financial information to allow a more
detailed review of its HomeAdvisor business. The Committee discussed potential responses to IAC's proposal, as well as the Committee's
desire to obtain more information about the HomeAdvisor business. The Committee directed management to schedule a due diligence
meeting between the management teams of Angie's List and IAC to further evaluate the potential merits of the proposed combination.
Representatives of the Financial Advisors also provided an update to the Committee on discussions with Company B, including Company
B's indication that it might reduce its previously proposed purchase price because the underlying operating metrics of the business made
available by Angie's List did not align with Company B's expectations.

        On March 1, 2017, Angie's List and IAC entered into a non-disclosure agreement for the provision by IAC to Angie's List of non-
public information concerning the HomeAdvisor business.

        On March 2, 2017, Company B indicated in a telephone call to a representative of Allen & Company that if Company B were to
proceed, its proposal would likely be lower, in the range of $7.00 to $8.00 per share in cash, based on its further due diligence review of
Angie's List.

        Also on March 2, 2017, representatives of Angie's List and IAC met to discuss IAC's proposal of February 23, 2017 and engage in a
due diligence review regarding the assumptions and expectations underlying that proposal.

        On March 7, 2017, the Angie's List board of directors held a meeting, which was also attended by Angie's List management and
representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial Advisors. The Financial Advisors updated the Angie's List board of directors as to the
status of discussions with the three parties that had submitted preliminary indications of interest and the financial terms of their respective
proposals. The Angie's List board of directors discussed with management and the Financial Advisors potential responses to, and potential
next steps with, each bidder. The Angie's List board of directors directed the Committee to develop a response to IAC that would seek an
increased stake for Angie's List's securityholders in the combined company. The Angie's List board of directors also discussed with
management, among other matters, financial information and forecasts for the first quarter of 2017, the revised 2017 operating plan for
Angie's List as a standalone company and various assumptions and expectations underlying the operating plan, including with respect to
the narrowed strategic focus of Angie's List, headcount assumptions and the potential impact of the revised plan on various business units.
After discussion, the Angie's List board of directors approved the revised plan (which replaced Angie's List's prior preliminary budget and
forecast), including cost-cutting initiatives in certain areas to shift spending more heavily towards marketing and more narrowly focus on
Angie's List's core business.

        Pursuant to the direction of the Angie's List board of directors, the Committee met on March 9, 2017 with Angie's List management
and representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial Advisors in attendance to discuss potential responses to IAC. After discussion, the
Committee directed the Financial Advisors to respond to IAC's proposal with a counterproposal for a combination of Angie's List with
IAC's HomeAdvisor business that would result in Angie's List's stockholders receiving, upon consummation of the transaction, 22% of the
combined company. The Committee also discussed potential next steps with the other interested parties, and directed the Financial
Advisors to seek greater clarity from Company A as to the structure and terms of its proposal and to instruct Company A that it would
need to increase the valuation of Angie's List reflected in its proposal. The Financial Advisors delivered those responses to IAC and
Company A the following day, March 10, 2017, as instructed. IAC responded that it was not interested in pursuing a transaction on the
terms indicated by Angie's List and requested to speak directly with representatives of the Angie's List board of directors.

        On March 16, 2017, Mr. Evans met with Mr. Levin to further discuss IAC's proposal of February 23, 2017 and Angie's List's
counterproposal of March 10, 2017. At this meeting, Mr. Evans indicated that Angie's List was not interested in pursuing a transaction
resulting in Angie's List securityholders holding 10% of the equity in the combined company. In response, Mr. Levin proposed to include
the HomeAdvisor's European business and certain other assets in IAC's contribution to the combined company, and to calculate the
relative ownership percentages without regard to the outstanding indebtedness of Angie's List. Mr. Levin indicated that, except for the
foregoing modifications, IAC's prior proposal of February 23, 2017 was unchanged, including the proposal that Angie's List
securityholders would receive 10% of the equity in the combined company.

        The Committee met three times, once on March 17, 2017 and twice on March 22, 2017, to discuss IAC's revised proposal conveyed
on March 16, 2017. Angie's List management and representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial Advisors were also in attendance at
these meetings. After discussion of various potential responses to IAC, as well as the potential operational restructuring that Angie's List
was considering, the Committee instructed the Financial Advisors to propose to IAC that, in addition to IAC's proposed modifications to
its proposal conveyed on March 16, 2017, Angie's List securityholders receive 18% of the outstanding equity in the combined company.
The Financial Advisors conveyed this response to IAC on March 23, 2017, as instructed.

        On March 24, 2017, IAC rejected Angie's List's latest proposal regarding ownership by Angie's List securityholders of 18% of the
equity in the combined company and instead proposed to increase the consideration offered in IAC's March 16, 2017 proposal by
including $1.00 in cash per share of Angie's List common stock.

        On March 28, 2017, the Angie's List board of directors held a meeting, which was also attended by Angie's List management,
representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial Advisors. Management provided an update on Angie's List's business and execution
against the revised operating plan, including with respect to the timing of the previously discussed reduction in the Angie's List workforce.
The Financial Advisors updated the Angie's List board of directors as to the financial terms and status of the various proposals received by
Angie's List to date, noting that Company A had yet to provide a clearer explanation regarding the structure and other details of its
proposal, and that Company B had not yet scheduled a meeting with Angie's List management. The Angie's List board of directors
discussed and considered these matters, as well as various protections that Angie's List might negotiate for the benefit of Angie's List's
stockholders in connection with a potential negotiated combination with the HomeAdvisor Business in which IAC would become the
controlling stockholder of the combined company. The Angie's List board of directors discussed potential responses to IAC and authorized
the Committee to formulate a response to IAC that would not include the $1.00 per share cash consideration recently proposed by IAC
(which the Angie's List board of directors determined would deprive stockholders of additional potential upside in the combined company)
and would instead

seek an increased equity stake for Angie's List securityholders of between 12% and 15% in the combined company.

        Immediately following the Angie's List board of directors' meeting, the Committee met on March 28, 2017 with Angie's List
management and representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial Advisors in attendance, to discuss potential responses to IAC and how
best to increase the interest of Company B in an acquisition of Angie's List and its engagement in the process. After discussion of various
potential responses to IAC, as well as the possibility of Angie's List continuing as a standalone company and potential stockholder
responses to Angie's List pursuit of these various alternatives, the Committee instructed the Financial Advisors to respond to IAC with a
counterproposal for a stock-for-stock transaction in which Angie's List securityholders would receive 13% of the equity in the combined
company. The Financial Advisors conveyed this response to a representative of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, IAC's financial advisor
("JPMorgan"), on March 29, 2017, as instructed.

        On March 29, 2017, a representative of JPMorgan responded to Angie's List's counterproposal of March 29, 2017 with a revised
proposal for an all-stock transaction in which Angie's List securityholders would receive 12% of the equity in the combined company, and
also provided a term sheet to Angie's List specifying certain proposed governance terms for the combined company, including a multi-
class structure for the combined company's common stock (with IAC holding the high-vote shares), and certain protections for minority
stockholders. The term sheet also indicated that IAC's proposal was made on the basis that IAC would enter into a satisfactory voting
agreement in support of the proposed transaction with certain significant stockholders of Angie's List holding, in the aggregate,
approximately 40% of the outstanding shares of Angie's List's common stock, and also noted that IAC's proposal was contingent on
satisfactory completion of due diligence. The term sheet also proposed a transaction structure whereby HomeAdvisor and Angie's List
would be combined into a new publicly traded company through a contribution of HomeAdvisor to a newly formed company, and a
merger of Angie's List into a subsidiary of such newly formed company.

        The Committee met on March 30, 2017 with Angie's List management and representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial
Advisors also in attendance. The Financial Advisors informed the Committee that Company A had verbally indicated earlier that day that
it would provide a revised proposal for a combination of Company A and Angie's List in which Angie's List stockholders in the aggregate
would receive, upon consummation of the transaction, approximately 40% of the combined company's outstanding common stock in
addition to cash consideration of $100 million. The Committee also discussed IAC's counterproposal of March 30, 2017 and determined to
inform IAC that the Committee was not willing to pursue the proposed combination with the HomeAdvisor Business if it would result in
Angie's List stockholders receiving less than an aggregate of 13% of the equity in the combined company.

        On March 31, 2017, in accordance with the directives of the Committee, Mr. Evans discussed with Mr. Levin Angie's List's
counterproposal and informed Mr. Levin of the Committee's position that Angie's List securityholders receive 13% of the equity in the
combined company. During this discussion, Mr. Levin initially countered with a 12.5% equity stake for Angie's List stockholders, but
ultimately agreed to pursue further negotiations regarding a combination in which Angie's List securityholders would receive 13% of the
equity in the combined company, subject to agreement on satisfactory governance terms and IAC's entry into a satisfactory voting
agreement with certain stockholders of Angie's List, as previously indicated. Mr. Levin also indicated a desire to enter into an exclusivity
arrangement with Angie's List in order to proceed expeditiously in negotiating definitive transaction agreements, and representatives of
JPMorgan provided a draft exclusivity letter to representatives of Allen & Company the following day.

        On April 2, 2017, Company B verbally indicated to the Financial Advisors that Company B had revised its proposal to acquire all of
the outstanding shares of Angie's List common stock to an

indicative range of $8.00 to $8.50 per share in cash. Prior to the following meetings on April 3, 2017, Company B informed the Financial
Advisors that it would not submit a revised indication of interest but that Company B might be interested in further discussions with
Angie's List if a strategic transaction were not agreed upon and consummated with another interested party.

        On April 3, 2017, the Committee met, with Angie's List management and representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial Advisors
also in attendance. The Financial Advisors updated the Committee as to Company B's revised proposal. The Committee also discussed
IAC's request for exclusivity as well as IAC's request that Angie's List approach certain Angie's List stockholders to discuss the
combination proposed by IAC, request their support and assess their willingness to enter into a proposed voting agreement. Following
these discussions, the Committee temporarily adjourned its meeting to join an Angie's List board of directors meeting. During the course
of the Angie's List board of directors meeting, which was also attended by Angie's List management and representatives of Sidley Austin
and the Financial Advisors, the Angie's List board of directors discussed IAC's proposed governance term sheet provided on March 30,
2017 and IAC's request for exclusivity, as well as the desire of the Angie's List board to obtain further details regarding the proposed 13%
equity interest of Angie's List securityholders in the combined company. The Angie's List board of directors determined to seek agreement
on how the outstanding equity awards of Angie's List and outstanding equity awards held by employees of the HomeAdvisor Business, as
well as equity awards expected to be granted prior to the completion of the proposed transaction, would impact the proposed relative
ownership percentages in the combined company. The Angie's List board of directors also discussed the status of discussions with
Company A, the significant business challenges faced by Company A and the lack of a clear proposal from Company A as to how a
combination of Angie's List with Company A would improve the prospects of the combined business, as well as the implied value of
Company A's proposal to Angie's List stockholders based on financial information provided by Company A. In light of the uncertainties
regarding Company A's proposal, the Angie's List board of directors directed management, with the assistance of the Financial Advisors,
to prioritize development of the proposals from Company B and IAC as the Angie's List board of directors believed they offered greater
value and certainty to Angie's List stockholders. Regarding Company B, the Angie's List board of directors discussed the status of the
discussions with Company B and noted that Company B had indicated that it still needed to conduct additional due diligence and further
develop its business model. The Angie's List board of directors determined that the Committee should also engage in further negotiations
with IAC regarding the terms of its proposed combination before determining whether to enter into the requested exclusivity arrangement
with IAC.

        Following the Angie's List board of directors meeting, during a continuation of the Committee's prior meeting, the Committee further
compared the relative merits and risks of the proposals submitted by IAC and Company B. The Committee discussed concerns regarding
the likelihood that Company B would ultimately make a compelling, actionable offer and successfully complete a potential acquisition of
Angie's List in light of Company B's failure to meet with Angie's List management as requested by Angie's List or conduct more detailed
due diligence despite ample time to do so and the efforts to increase Company B's engagement and interest in a potential acquisition. The
Committee instructed the Financial Advisors to continue pursuing a revised proposal from Company B that offered greater value to
Angie's List stockholders and to engage in discussions with IAC and its advisors regarding the calculation of the ownership split,
capitalization and governance of the proposed combined company, as discussed with the Angie's List board of directors. The Committee
also instructed Sidley Austin to engage in discussions with Wachtell Lipton, legal counsel to IAC, regarding the terms of the transaction
proposed by IAC.

        On April 3, 2017, Wachtell Lipton provided a draft merger agreement to Sidley Austin. This initial draft of the merger agreement
contemplated several "deal protections," including, among others, a "force-the-vote" provision that would require the merger agreement to
be submitted to a vote of

Angie's List stockholders even if the Angie's List board of directors were no longer recommending its adoption, a $20 million termination
fee payable by Angie's List to IAC following the termination of the merger agreement in specified circumstances and a $10 million
expense reimbursement payable by Angie's List to IAC if the merger agreement were to be terminated for failure to obtain the approval of
the Angie's List stockholders. The draft merger agreement also reflected the transaction structure proposed in the term sheet, whereby
HomeAdvisor and Angie's List would be combined into a new publicly traded company. Over the course of the next several weeks,
Wachtell Lipton provided to Sidley Austin drafts of the proposed ancillary agreements to be entered into in connection with the proposed
transaction, forms of the proposed certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the combined company to be in effect as of the closing of the
proposed transaction, and a form of voting agreement that IAC sought to enter into with several of Angie's List's significant stockholders.
On April 4, 2017, representatives of Sidley Austin and Wachtell Lipton held a conference call during which representatives of Sidley
Austin indicated that, prior to engaging in negotiations regarding the terms of a definitive merger agreement, Angie's List sought to agree
on the treatment of Angie's List and HomeAdvisor Business equity awards in the calculation of the proposed ownership split in the
combined company.

        On April 6, 2017, Company A submitted a revised indication of interest for a combination of Company A and Angie's List in which
Angie's List stockholders in the aggregate would receive, upon consummation of the transaction, approximately 42% of the combined
company's outstanding common stock, as well as cash consideration of $100 million. Also on April 6, 2017, representatives of Sidley
Austin contacted representatives of Wachtell Lipton and communicated the high-level issues that the Angie's List board of directors had
with the voting agreement that IAC sought to enter into with certain stockholders of Angie's List and the other deal protections proposed
by IAC, including with respect to the ability of Angie's List to engage with third parties that may be interested in making competing
proposals following the execution of the merger agreement, the limited rights of Angie's List to terminate the merger agreement prior to a
vote of Angie's List stockholders on its adoption, the circumstances under which Angie's List would be obligated to pay IAC a termination
fee upon termination of the merger agreement, the amount of the termination fee and other deal protections contained in Wachtell Lipton's
draft merger agreement. In response, representatives of Wachtell Lipton conveyed IAC's reasons for the proposed provisions and IAC's
positions on the topics raised. The representatives of Sidley Austin and Wachtell Lipton also discussed the proposed transaction structure
and agreed that the proposed structure was the most efficient from a tax and governance perspective.

        On April 7, 2017, the Committee met with Angie's List management and representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial Advisors
in attendance. Representatives of the Financial Advisors updated the Committee as to their discussions with IAC since the prior
Committee meeting, and representatives of Sidley Austin updated the Committee as to discussions with Wachtell Lipton regarding
exclusivity, certain proposed deal protections and the ongoing due diligence reviews of Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business.
Representatives of the Financial Advisors also updated the Committee as to Company A's revised proposal submitted on April 6, 2017 and
the transaction timeline proposed by Company A. The Committee requested that the Financial Advisors ask Company A to further
increase the value offered by its proposal to Angie's List stockholders. The attendees also discussed Company B's statements to the
Financial Advisors on April 3, 2017, and Company B's failure to formally submit a revised bid. The Committee instructed the Financial
Advisors to pursue further discussions with Company B, offer to provide Company B with updated capitalization data of Angie's List, and
request a "best and final" proposal from Company B. The Committee also determined that it was not prepared to agree to the requested
exclusivity arrangement with IAC.

        Later in the day on April 7, 2017, at the direction of the Angie's List board of directors, representatives of the Financial Advisors
spoke with a representative of Company A, who stated that Company A's proposal provided on the previous day was its best and final
offer. Additionally, at the

direction of the Angie's List board of directors, representatives of the Financial Advisors provided Angie's List's updated capitalization
data to Company B.

        On April 9, 2017, as directed by IAC and Angie's List, representatives of JPMorgan and Allen & Company discussed IAC's and
Angie's List's respective proposals for the treatment of the outstanding equity awards of Angie's List and the outstanding equity awards
held by employees of the HomeAdvisor Business in the calculation of the number of Class B shares of the combined company to be held
by IAC upon the completion of the proposed transaction (and the resultant ownership percentages of Angie's List securityholders, on the
one hand, and IAC and HomeAdvisor Business equity award holders, on the other hand, in the combined company).

        On April 10, 2017, Company B submitted a preliminary, non-binding proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Angie's List
common stock for $7.50 per share in cash. Also on April 10 and April 11, 2017, representatives of Angie's List (including a Committee
member, Mr. Evans) and IAC met in Indianapolis to conduct due diligence on Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business and discussed
potential synergies that might be achieved by the combined company. Representatives of the Financial Advisors and JPMorgan also
attended these meetings.

        On April 11, 2017, Sidley Austin provided a revised draft merger agreement to Wachtell Lipton. Among other changes, this revised
draft of the merger agreement rejected the force-the-vote provision of the April 3 draft and permitted Angie's List to terminate the merger
agreement to accept a superior proposal upon payment of the termination fee, reduced the termination fee to $10 million and rejected the
$10 million expense reimbursement obligations on Angie's List. Thereafter, until the agreement was finalized and executed on May 1,
2017, Wachtell Lipton and Sidley Austin negotiated the terms of the Merger Agreement, the forms of the Ancillary Agreements and the
other transaction documents.

        On April 12, 2017, the Committee met with Angie's List management and representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial
Advisors. The Financial Advisors updated the Committee as to the status of the most recently received proposals from each of IAC,
Company A and Company B, and the attendees discussed Company B's non-binding proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
Angie's List common stock for $7.50 per share in cash and Company A's statement that its proposal submitted on April 6, 2017 was its
best and final offer. The Committee instructed the Financial Advisors to schedule a telephone call with Company B in order to further
discuss Company B's proposal. The attendees discussed the status of the negotiations with IAC and IAC's ongoing due diligence review of
Angie's List. In addition, a representative of Sidley Austin updated the Committee as to the status of ongoing negotiations regarding the
proposed merger agreement, the forms of certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the combined company to be in effect at the closing of
the proposed transaction and certain ancillary agreements that the combined company would enter into with IAC in connection with the
proposed transaction.

        On April 15, 2017, representatives of Angie's List (including Mr. Evans), together with representatives of Allen & Company and
Sidley Austin, held a conference call with representatives of IAC (including Mr. Levin), JPMorgan and Wachtell Lipton to discuss the
most recent proposals of each of IAC and Angie's List regarding deal protections, the governance of the combined company and the
protections sought by Angie's List for the minority stockholders of the combined company to determine whether there was a basis on
which to continue negotiations. Following discussion, it was determined that Angie's List would formulate a revised proposal and deliver
the proposal to IAC.

        On April 16, 2017, the Committee met with Angie's List management and representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial
Advisors. During this meeting, Sidley Austin provided the Committee with an update as to the status of negotiations with IAC regarding
the terms of the proposed transaction, including with respect to deal protections and governance of the combined company, and the
Committee gave guidance and instruction to Sidley Austin regarding such terms.

Table of Contents

        Later that day, Sidley Austin delivered a revised proposal regarding deal protections, combined company governance and minority
stockholder protections to Wachtell Lipton which, in key part, proposed that Angie's List be permitted to terminate the merger agreement
to accept a superior proposal upon payment of a termination fee, provided for a prohibition on IAC completing certain "squeeze out"
transactions during a specified post-closing period without the approval of an independent committee of the combined company's board of
directors, and provided for representation on the combined company's board of directors by current Angie's List directors (or their chosen
successors). Although open issues remained, IAC agreed that it would continue negotiating the terms of the draft merger agreement and
related ancillary agreements on this basis.

        On April 17, 2017, Wachtell Lipton provided a revised draft of the merger agreement to Sidley Austin, which contemplated a $20
million termination fee, but accepted Angie's List's rejection of the expense reimbursement provision and of the force-the-vote provision.
Moreover, this updated draft accepted Angie's List's proposal that Angie's List be permitted to terminate the merger agreement to accept a
superior proposal after complying with specified procedures and upon payment of the termination fee.

        On April 18, 2017, a mutual due diligence session was held in New York City with representatives of IAC, the HomeAdvisor
Business, JPMorgan, Angie's List (including a Committee member, Mr. Evans) and the Financial Advisors in attendance. At this meeting,
the representatives and advisors of IAC conducted follow-up due diligence on Angie's List and Angie's List's representatives and advisors
reviewed certain financial and operational information relating to the HomeAdvisor Business.

        On April 20, 2017, representatives of Angie's List management, Mr. Evans and Company B met in Chicago, Illinois to discuss
Angie's List's business, operating results and financial model, as well as potential synergies, prospects for a combined company, and
certain financial information regarding Company B's proposal.

        On April 20, 2017, as directed by IAC and Angie's List, representatives of JPMorgan and Allen & Company further discussed IAC's
and Angie's List's respective positions regarding the treatment of certain unvested outstanding equity awards held by employees of the
HomeAdvisor Business in the calculation of the number of Class B shares of the combined company to be held by IAC upon completion
of the proposed transaction (and the resultant ownership percentages of Angie's List securityholders, on the one hand, and IAC and
HomeAdvisor Business equity award holders, on the other hand, in the combined company), as IAC and Angie's List had not yet reached
agreement on this point. At the request of IAC and Angie's List, representatives of JPMorgan and Allen & Company spoke again on
April 22, 2017 to discuss the same topic, with a representative of Allen & Company stating, as instructed by Angie's List, that Angie's List
had not accepted IAC's prior proposal. The representatives of JPMorgan and Allen & Company concluded that Mr. Levin and Mr. Evans
should speak in an effort to reach agreement on this topic. Mr. Levin and Mr. Evans spoke on April 24, 2017 and agreed that 50% of the
outstanding in-the-money unvested equity awards held by employees of the HomeAdvisor Business would reduce the number of Class B
shares in the combined company to be held by IAC at the closing, with the remaining 50% diluting all stockholders of the combined
company post-closing. Although the parties continued to frame their discussions on the basis of an equity split between IAC and the
Angie's List stockholders of approximately 87% and 13%, respectively, when taking into account the treatment of equity awards, former
Angie's List securityholders (including option and RSU holders) would own approximately 12.75% of the outstanding common stock of
the combined company on a fully diluted basis upon consummation of the transaction. The Angie's List board of directors focused on, and
similarly directed the Financial Advisors to assume, this 12.75% fully diluted equity ownership percentage, as it represented a more
conservative view (as it reflected dilution from outstanding equity awards relating to the HomeAdvisor Business) of the relative equity
ownership percentage for former Angie's List securityholders. The financial projections shared with

Company B on April 20, 2017 were also shared with IAC on April 21, 2017 and are the financial projections set forth in the section
entitled "—Certain Financial Projections."

        On April 24, 2017, the Committee met with certain members of Angie's List management in attendance. A Committee member
briefed the Committee on discussions held with a significant stockholder of Angie's List that had entered into a non-disclosure agreement
and from which IAC had requested that the Company obtain a voting agreement in order to share with such stockholder the progress in
evaluating strategic alternatives and the proposals from IAC, Company A and Company B, and to ascertain the stockholder's relative
interest in each of the three proposals. The stockholder indicated a preference for the combination with IAC, but expressed that it wanted
additional value and downside protection. The Committee also discussed Company B's revised proposal, submitted earlier that day, to
acquire all of the outstanding shares of Angie's List common stock for $7.85 to $8.00 per share in cash (subsequently verbally confirmed
by representatives of Company B to be $8.00 per share based on Angie's List's then current capitalization), and the guidance to be
provided to the Financial Advisors and Sidley Austin on continuing discussions with Company B and outreach to Angie's List
stockholders to assess their support of the proposed transaction with IAC.

        Also on April 24, 2017, the IAC board of directors held a meeting to discuss the proposed transaction with members of IAC
management and representatives of Wachtell Lipton in attendance. IAC management updated the IAC board of directors on the proposed
transaction, reviewed the course of negotiations with Angie's List over the previous weeks and described the key economic terms of the
proposed transaction. Management and representatives of Wachtell Lipton also reviewed with the IAC board of directors the key terms of
the proposed merger agreement and related ancillary agreements and discussed the remaining open items prior to entering into a definitive
agreement, including whether IAC would ultimately be able to obtain voting agreements with certain significant stockholders of Angie's
List, and discussed the expected timeline to reaching agreement with Angie's List on the definitive terms of the proposed transaction. After
discussion, the IAC board of directors approved the entry by IAC, ANGI Homeservices and Merger Sub into definitive agreements with
Angie's List on the terms described at the meeting and delegated to the Executive Committee of the IAC board of directors the authority to
oversee and approve the negotiation and finalization of the remaining open terms of the proposed transaction.

        On April 25, 2017, with the consent of Angie's List and at the request of a certain significant stockholder of Angie's List, a
representative of IAC met with the stockholder to discuss the proposed transaction and such stockholder's willingness to enter into a voting
agreement in support of the transaction with IAC. The stockholder indicated to the IAC representative that the stockholder would not be
willing to enter into a voting agreement with IAC if the economic terms of the transaction were not improved from those currently
proposed by IAC and Angie's List.

        On April 28, 2017, the Committee met with representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial Advisors. Representatives of Sidley
Austin and the Financial Advisors briefed the Committee on the ongoing negotiations with IAC regarding the terms of the proposed
transaction. The Financial Advisors also briefed the Committee on discussions held by Mr. Evans with three significant stockholders of
Angie's List (that had entered into non-disclosure agreements and from which IAC had requested that Angie's List obtain voting
agreements) regarding Angie's List's progress in evaluating strategic alternatives and the proposals from IAC, Company A and Company
B. The stockholders indicated a preference for the combination with IAC, but expressed that they wanted additional value and downside
protection for the stockholders of Angie's List. The stockholders also encouraged Angie's List to seek to obtain a higher proposal from
Company B. The Committee also discussed Company B's proposal to acquire Angie's List with representatives of Sidley Austin and the
Financial Advisors. The Committee instructed the Financial Advisors to contact Company B to again request its best and final offer. The
Committee also instructed the Financial Advisors to inform IAC's advisors that the value offered to Angie's List stockholders in IAC's
proposal of March 31, 2017 must be improved and to

continue to seek agreement on the treatment of unvested equity awards of Angie's List in the calculation of the number of Class B shares
of the combined company to be held by IAC upon the completion of the proposed transaction.

        Later that same day, in accordance with the Committee's directives, a representative of Allen & Company contacted a representative
of JPMorgan and communicated the Committee's position that, in order to proceed with the proposed transaction, IAC must increase the
consideration Angie's List securityholders would receive in the transaction. After discussion with IAC, the representative of JPMorgan
responded to the representative of Allen & Company and stated that IAC was not willing to increase the consideration offered in the
proposed transaction by any amount, but that, to alleviate certain concerns communicated by the Committee regarding downside
protection for Angie's List stockholders, IAC would consider offering a portion of the transaction consideration in cash, at the election of
Angie's List stockholders.

        On April 29, 2017, the Angie's List board of directors met with Angie's List management and representatives of Sidley Austin and the
Financial Advisors in attendance. The Financial Advisors provided an update as to the current status of negotiations with the three parties
that had submitted preliminary indications of interest and subsequent proposals and reviewed the financial terms of the then-current
proposals, noting, among other things, that representatives of each of Company A and Company B had communicated to the Financial
Advisors that their respective then-current proposals were their best and final offers to acquire Angie's List. The Angie's List board of
directors discussed the proposal from Company A and determined that, compared to the value and the certainty of the proposal from IAC,
Company A's proposal undervalued Angie's List, that it was not reasonably likely that Company A would improve its proposal and that, as
a result, Angie's List should not further pursue negotiations regarding a potential transaction with Company A. The Angie's List board of
directors also discussed the status of discussions with Company B, and in particular Company B's revised proposal to acquire all of the
outstanding shares of Angie's List common stock for $8.00 per share in cash, which Company B had confirmed was its best and final offer.
The Angie's List board of directors then concluded that IAC's stock-for-stock proposal offered Angie's list stockholders greater value
potential than Company B's proposal. Representatives of Sidley Austin reviewed with the Angie's List board of directors the material terms
of the proposed transaction documentation in respect IAC's proposed combination of Angie's List with the HomeAdvisor Business. The
Financial Advisors also discussed with the Angie's List board of directors preliminary financial perspectives regarding a combination with
the HomeAdvisor Business and members of the Committee, along with representatives of the Financial Advisors, updated the Angie's List
board of directors regarding the outreach, as directed by the Committee, to certain of Angie's List's significant stockholders to gauge their
support for the proposed transaction with IAC. The Angie's List board of directors discussed the status of these discussions and instructed
the Financial Advisors to inform IAC's financial advisor that the Angie's List board of directors would require that three of the
13 percentage points of the equity in the combined company proposed to be allocated to Angie's List securityholders be offered as a cash
election at a price of $8.50 per share of Angie's List common stock. Representatives of Sidley Austin also reviewed with the Angie's List
board of directors certain fiduciary duties and legal matters relating to the Angie's List board of directors' consideration of the proposed
Transactions and discussed certain material terms of the proposed Merger Agreement, the proposed Ancillary Agreements and the
proposed amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of ANGI Homeservices.

        Later that day, in accordance with the directives of the Angie's List board of directors, a representative of Allen & Company informed
a representative of JPMorgan of the requirement of the Angie's List board of directors that, in order to proceed with the proposed
transaction, the value attributable to three of the 13 percentage points of the equity in the combined company proposed to be allocated to
Angie's List securityholders should be offered to Angie's List stockholders in the form

of cash at a price of $8.50 per share of Angie's List common stock. The representative of Allen & Company also relayed the request from a
significant stockholder of Angie's List that such stockholder receive representation on the board of directors of the combined company.
Following discussion with IAC, including the members of the Executive Committee of the IAC board of directors, the representative of
JPMorgan informed the representative of Allen & Company that IAC was willing to accept the requirement of the Angie's List board of
directors to make cash consideration of $8.50 per share of Angie's List common stock available for election by Angie's List stockholders,
subject to a cap on the aggregate cash consideration payable by IAC of $130 million, and that IAC was not willing to extend a board seat
to the Angie's List stockholder. Mr. Levin concurrently called Mr. Evans to relay the same message.

        On April 30, 2017, in accordance with the directives of the Angie's List board of directors, representatives of Allen & Company
contacted representatives of JPMorgan to report that, subject to the approval of the Angie's List board of directors, Angie's List was willing
to agree to the $130 million cap on the aggregate cash consideration to be made available for election by Angie's List stockholders.
Representatives of IAC, JPMorgan and Wachtell Lipton, on the one hand, and the representatives of Angie's List, the Financial Advisors
and Sidley Austin, on the other hand, worked to resolve the remaining open issues. Representatives of Sidley Austin and Wachtell Lipton
also continued to negotiate the terms of the proposed voting agreement with certain significant stockholders of Angie's List.

        On May 1, 2017, the Angie's List board of directors met to consider IAC's proposed combination of Angie's List with the
HomeAdvisor Business, with Angie's List management and representatives of Sidley Austin and the Financial Advisors in attendance. The
Angie's List board of directors was provided in advance of the meeting with proposed final versions of the Merger Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements, the proposed amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of ANGI
Homeservices that would be in effect upon completion of the transaction, and certain other materials related to the Transactions. At the
meeting, representatives of the Financial Advisors and Sidley Austin updated the Angie's List board of directors on negotiations with IAC
since the last Angie's List board of directors meeting and the Financial Advisors reviewed with the Angie's List board of directors the
proposed final terms negotiated with IAC, subject to the Angie's List board of directors' approval, of the Transactions, noting among other
things that, under the proposed terms, each outstanding share of Angie's List common stock would be converted into the right to receive, at
the option of the holder thereof, either one Class A share of the combined company or $8.50 in cash, without interest (subject to a cap on
the aggregate cash consideration payable by IAC of $130 million). Members of the Committee, along with representatives of the Financial
Advisors, also updated the Angie's List board of directors as to the status of the proposed voting agreement to be entered into by certain
significant stockholders of Angie's List, noting that one of those stockholders had expressed support for the proposed Transactions but,
given pre-existing encumbrances on the stockholder's Angie's List stock, was unable to enter into a voting agreement with IAC and that
the other stockholders indicated that they were not willing to execute voting agreements. Representatives of Sidley Austin had notified
representatives of Wachtell Lipton of the status of the voting agreement immediately prior to the Angie's List board meeting and informed
the Angie's List board of directors that IAC had indicated its willingness nevertheless to proceed with the Transactions in the absence of
the proposed voting agreements.

        At the May 1, 2017 meeting, representatives of Sidley Austin again reviewed with the Angie's List board of directors certain legal
matters and fiduciary duties relating to the Angie's List board of directors' consideration of the proposed Transactions and discussed certain
material terms of the proposed Merger Agreement, the proposed Ancillary Agreements and the proposed amended and restated certificate
of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of ANGI Homeservices. Also at this meeting, the Financial Advisors reviewed with the

analyses of the proposed Merger Consideration, and each Financial Advisor separately rendered an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery by
of a written opinion dated May 1, 2017, to the Angie's List board of directors to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to
various assumptions, limitations and qualifications described in the opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received pursuant to the
Merger Agreement by holders of Angie's List common stock was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. Following
discussion, the Angie's List board of directors, taking into account various factors and potential risks, including those described below in
the sections entitled "—Joint Reasons of Angie's List and IAC for the Transactions" and "—Angie's List's Reasons for the Transactions;
Recommendation of the Angie's List Board of Directors," unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of Angie's List's
stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into the proposed Merger Agreement, approved the execution, delivery and performance
of the proposed Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions and resolved to recommend adoption of the proposed
Merger Agreement by the stockholders of Angie's List and to submit the proposed Merger Agreement to the stockholders of Angie's List
for adoption.

        After the meeting, the Merger Agreement was executed by Angie's List, IAC, ANGI Homeservices and Merger Sub and the execution
of the Merger Agreement and the proposed Transactions were announced at approximately 5:30 p.m. Eastern time on May 1, 2017 in a
press release jointly issued by Angie's List and IAC.

Joint Reasons of Angie's List and IAC for the Transactions

        IAC and Angie's List (which, for purposes of this section, are sometimes referred to as "we" and "our") believe that the combination
of the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List pursuant to the Transactions will enhance stockholder value by, among other things,
enabling the combined company, ANGI Homeservices, to capitalize on the market opportunity presented by the following dynamics of the
home services market:

• Large and growing addressable market:  The U.S. home services market is large and growing, with an estimated total value
in excess of $400 billion in 2017, and an expected compound annual growth rate of approximately 6% over the next five
years, according to Cowen and Company. Following the completion of the Transactions, we expect ANGI Homeservices to
have a network of approximately 200,000 service professionals, with the ability to cover more than 500 categories of home
services jobs in more than 400 discrete geographic markets in the United States. As the operator of the largest global home
services marketplace, we believe ANGI Homeservices will be well positioned to capitalize on this growing market. 

• Fragmented two-sided marketplace:  The home services market is also highly fragmented on both the consumer and
service professional sides of the marketplace. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 American Housing Survey,
there are 74 million owner-occupied households in the United States and, on average, homeowners complete over six jobs
per year, according to HomeAdvisor's internal brand tracking study. There are over 3 million service professionals serving
this addressable market (according to Cowen and Company estimates), who we believe are using a wide array of solutions
to connect to homeowners. We believe this substantial fragmentation means that both consumers and service professionals
experience significant friction when trying to transact, which creates an opportunity for a technology-driven marketplace to
provide a superior solution. We believe a solutions provider such as ANGI Homeservices can provide enduring value to
service professionals and to homeowners by reducing friction, increasing total transaction volume, enabling more
satisfying experiences and delivering improved returns (whether measured by time spent searching or dollars spent
marketing) to marketplace participants.

• Accelerating online migration:  The home services market is one of the largest remaining marketplaces where digital
penetration remains low. We believe that a significant portion of service requests are fulfilled offline through word of
mouth and referrals. We expect the migration to online marketplaces for finding and booking home services to accelerate in
the future due to many factors, including: (i) the increased convenience and appeal of matching homeowners with service
professionals through the application of technology, facilitated by the increased consumer adoption of internet-connected
mobile devices, (ii) an increasing supply of digitally-savvy service professionals as more of them join online marketplaces
as part of the continued shift toward more efficient and trackable marketing solutions and (iii) favorable demographic
trends, including increasing homeownership by millennials, who we believe are generally more willing to use online
services than older populations.

        We believe that the combined company will be better positioned than either Angie's List or the HomeAdvisor Business would be on a
standalone basis to capitalize on these dynamics of the home services market due to the substantial strategic and financial benefits that we
believe will result from the Transactions. We believe these benefits include:

• Network effects of the combination:  We believe that combining Angie's List, which has the industry's leading brand
(according to a brand measurement study conducted by the HomeAdvisor Business) and significant recurring organic
traffic (with an estimated 13.0 million monthly unique visitors to its platform (on average, for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2017, measured by daily unique visitors, according to web analytics company Omniture)), with the HomeAdvisor
Business, which we believe has the nation's largest online network of service professionals (with approximately 164,000
paying professionals in its network as of June 30, 2017), will create a more comprehensive, liquid and efficient
marketplace. Specifically, combining Angie's List's substantial intent-driven consumer traffic with HomeAdvisor's network
of service professionals is expected to result in a greater number of service requests on ANGI Homeservices platforms,
which will help absorb the current unused capacity in the HomeAdvisor network. The increased scale of the combined
company is also expected to accelerate the powerful network effects via a positive feedback loop that HomeAdvisor
currently enjoys, as a larger number of service requests will attract more quality service professionals to the ANGI
Homeservices network, which in turn will attract more consumers and generate more service requests which will attract
even more service professionals, and so on. The combined company will also have a more robust set of data to improve the
matching of service requests to service professionals, which is expected to increase the quality of the platforms and thereby
increase our ability to convert consumers and service professionals into long-term users of our platforms. In the
HomeAdvisor Business's experience, such network effects lead to better service professional quality, increased service
request frequency, improved customer and service professional retention and higher return on investment for participating
service professionals. 

• Diversifying the monetization model:  We believe that ANGI Homeservices will have best-in-class monetization
capabilities, spanning a variety of monetization methods, and offering choice to service professionals and consumers alike.
Currently, Angie's List operates an advertising business in which service professionals pay a fixed fee for advertising on the
Angie's List platform. HomeAdvisor operates a connection fee-based model, where the service professional pays customer
connection fees for matches provided by HomeAdvisor, as well as a subscription fee. The combined company will apply
HomeAdvisor's model to Angie's List traffic, and will offer Angie's List users the ability to be matched with service
professionals (through HomeAdvisor's various services for homeowners, including matching services using HomeAdvisor's
proprietary algorithm, Instant Booking and Instant Connect), with those service professionals paying connection fees. In
addition to monetizing Angie's List traffic through connection fees, the combined company will continue to offer Angie's
List's historical advertising

products, which offer service professionals access and exposure to the substantial consumer traffic on the Angie's List
platform for a fixed advertising price. To further drive revenue at the combined company, the ANGI Homeservices sales
force will cross-market and cross-sell both transactional and ad-based offerings to their combined base of service
professionals. We believe that offering service professionals the choice and flexibility to select the product that works best
for them will attract more service professionals to the network, and strengthen its offerings to home service customers as a
result.

• Enhancing innovation:  We expect that, by combining the resources of the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List, ANGI
Homeservices will be able to accelerate the product innovation that is fundamental to removing friction in order to drive
home services customers and service professionals online. Key focus areas include: (i) providing service professionals
better tools to track spending and revenues, (ii) increasing mobile app adoption (by consumers and service professionals),
(iii) enhancing the combined company's on-demand instant booking and instant connect offering, (iv) rolling out same-day
service and (v) continual improvement of the combined company's proprietary matching algorithms by increasingly
applying artificial intelligence and machine learning against our large database of transactions and customer feedback. We
believe that the increased reach, scale and resources of ANGI Homeservices will facilitate continued product innovation in
the rapidly growing digital home services market, leading to the potential for long-term revenue and earnings growth, as
well as improved consumer satisfaction. 

• Improving customer and service professional acquisition efficiency:  We believe the combined company will leverage
shared best practices and data to deliver market-leading customer acquisition efficiency, including: (i) enabling more
efficient nationwide online and offline advertising across our enlarged platforms due to larger (combined) advertising buys,
(ii) benefitting from additional data to enable more powerful online advertisement targeting and (iii) leveraging a combined
email list, which will increase the pool of potential consumers in the network. Moreover, we believe that the combined
company will have a more effective nationwide sales force, with the ability to utilize the combined company's platforms to
acquire service professionals more efficiently. 

• Achieving substantial synergies:  We believe that the Transactions will create significant synergies across the combined
company in three major categories: (i) cost savings that result from the streamlining of duplicative resources or the
refocusing of such otherwise duplicative resources toward growth initiatives; (ii) enhanced monetization of the Angie's List
consumer traffic by application of the HomeAdvisor business model; and (iii) efficiencies and conversion improvements
resulting from the increased scale of the combined company, including in the areas of sales, marketing and technology. 

• Blending compatible cultures and service philosophies:  ANGI Homeservices will have a highly experienced management
team assembled from both companies, and a board of directors comprised of representatives of both IAC and the current
board of directors of Angie's List. We believe that the industry expertise of management, coupled with the continuity in
management oversight in the combined company's board, will provide a deep understanding of the best practices of both
companies that will facilitate successful integration of the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List. Further, given the
expected headcount growth at the HomeAdvisor Business, the Angie's List workforce may help reduce HomeAdvisor's
outside hiring needs with the addition of qualified trained industry professionals.

Angie's List's Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the Angie's List Board of Directors

        The Angie's List board of directors believes that the businesses of Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business are complementary
and that a combination of Angie's List with the HomeAdvisor Business presents a compelling strategic opportunity to enhance value for
Angie's List stockholders. In evaluating the Transactions, the Angie's List board of directors consulted with Angie's List's management and
legal and financial advisors. In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and recommend the adoption of the Merger
Agreement to Angie's List's stockholders, the Angie's List board of directors considered a number of factors, including those described
above under "—Joint Reasons of Angie's List and IAC for the Transactions," as well as, among others, the following additional factors:

• the Angie's List board of directors' and management's knowledge of Angie's List's business, operations, financial condition
and prospects, and its and their understanding of the HomeAdvisor Business and its operations, financial condition and
prospects, including information obtained through due diligence reviews; 

• the fact that Angie's List's business and operations complement those of the HomeAdvisor Business and, despite the similar
nature of the businesses of Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business and that certain consumers and/or service providers
using the platforms operated by Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business may overlap, the fact that the market
opportunity for growth and the ability of the combined company to be better positioned to capitalize on the opportunities
for growth than Angie's List would be able to accomplish alone is compelling; 

• the expected synergies to be realized by the combined company, ANGI Homeservices, and the expectation of the Angie's
List board of directors that the future earnings and prospects of the combined company (and, relatedly, the value to Angie's
List stockholders who receive the Share Consideration) would be superior to those of Angie's List on a standalone basis; 

• the Angie's List board of directors' view that, following an extensive solicitation process (as further discussed above under
"—Background of the Transactions"), other strategic alternatives reasonably available to Angie's List would not result in
value for Angie's List stockholders greater than the Merger Consideration; 

• the fact that holders of Angie's List common stock will have an opportunity to receive shares of Class A common stock of
ANGI Homeservices pursuant to the Merger, the perceived likelihood that the future value of a Class A share of ANGI
Homeservices will exceed the potential future value of a share of Angie's List common stock, the potential for Class A
shares of ANGI Homeservices to increase in value following completion of the Merger, the ability that Angie's List
stockholders that receive the Share Consideration and hold Class A shares will have to participate in any such potential
increase in value, and the expected tax treatment of the receipt of Class A common stock of ANGI Homeservices in the
Merger; 

• the fact that holders of Angie's List common stock may elect to receive the Share Consideration or the Cash Consideration
in the Merger (or a combination thereof, by electing Cash Consideration with respect to some shares and Share
Consideration with respect to other shares held by such stockholder), subject to the proration procedures regarding the
aggregate Cash Consideration set forth in the Merger Agreement; 

• the value of the Merger Consideration in comparison to the current and historical market prices of Angie's List common
stock, including the fact that the $8.50 per share in cash that will be paid to stockholders who properly elect to receive the
Cash Consideration in the Merger (subject to the proration procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement) represents a
premium of approximately 45% to the $5.89 per share closing price of Angie's List common stock on NASDAQ on May 1,
2017, the last trading day prior to the announcement of the execution of

the Merger Agreement, and the percentage of ANGI Homeservices outstanding capital stock that Angie's List stockholders
who receive the Share Consideration are expected to own following the Merger;

• the financial presentation and separate opinions, each dated May 1, 2017, of Allen & Company and BofA Merrill Lynch to
the Angie's List board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of such date, of the Merger
Consideration to be received by holders of Angie's List common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which opinions
were based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations and
qualifications on the review undertaken, as more fully described in the section entitled "—Opinions of Angie's List's
Financial Advisors;" 

• the efforts made to negotiate a merger agreement that would be favorable to Angie's List and its stockholders and the terms
and conditions of the fully negotiated Merger Agreement, including the size of the termination fee of $20 million payable
to IAC in specified circumstances, and the parties' agreement on the circumstances under which such fee may become
payable, as further discussed in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Effects of Termination of the Merger
Agreement; Termination Fee and Expenses;" 

• the efforts made to negotiate the contribution agreement and the other ancillary agreements in forms that would be
favorable to Angie's List and its stockholders, and the terms and conditions of the fully negotiated Ancillary Agreements; 

• the extent of IAC's commitment to obtain the required regulatory approvals for the Merger under the Merger Agreement; 

• the ability of Angie's List under the terms of the Merger Agreement to negotiate with third parties concerning certain
unsolicited competing acquisition proposals if Angie's List were to receive such proposals prior to the adoption of the
Merger Agreement by the Angie's List stockholders, and the ability of Angie's List to terminate the Merger Agreement to
accept a superior proposal under certain circumstances, each as further described in the section entitled "The Merger
Agreement—No Solicitation by Angie's List of Alternative Takeover Proposals;" 

• the fact that two representatives from the Angie's List board of directors will serve as directors of ANGI Homeservices
following the Closing pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the directors selected by Angie's List, who will be Angela R.
Hicks Bowman and Thomas R. Evans, if they continue to be able and willing to serve, together with any replacements
designated pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement are referred to as the "ANGI-Designated Directors"), and the fact
that there are certain protections for the benefit of the minority stockholders of ANGI Homeservices set forth in the
amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws of ANGI Homeservices that will be in effect upon the
Closing, as well as certain provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement negotiated for the benefit of the minority
stockholders of ANGI Homeservices, including that from the Effective Time until the date the 2020 annual meeting of
stockholders of ANGI Homeservices is held, (i) certain procedures for selecting a replacement director in the event that one
or both of the ANGI-Designated Directors become unable or unwilling or otherwise cease to serve on the ANGI
Homeservices board of directors are in effect, (ii) IAC is prohibited from effecting a "squeeze-out" transaction pursuant to
Section 253 of the DGCL unless approved by a committee of independent directors of the ANGI Homeservices board of
directors, at least 50% of whom must be ANGI-Designated Directors so long as any ANGI-Designated Directors who
qualify as independent are then serving on the ANGI Homeservices board, and (iii) certain transferees of 20% or more of
IAC's equity interest in ANGI Homeservices are required to assume IAC's obligations under the Investor Rights
Agreement, as further described in the sections entitled "Corporate Governance of ANGI Homeservices Following the
Merger" and "Ancillary Agreements—Investor Rights Agreement."

        The Angie's List board of directors also weighed the factors described above against certain factors and potential risks associated with
entering into the Merger Agreement, including, among others, the following:

• the fact that Angie's List stockholders will receive ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock in the Merger, which will
have one vote per share, while IAC will own all of the shares of ANGI Homeservices Class B common stock, which will
have 10 votes per share, immediately following the Merger, and that IAC is expected to control a substantial majority of the
voting and economic interests in ANGI Homeservices immediately following the Merger; 

• the fact that there is no trading history for ANGI Homeservices equity securities or any equity securities of any of the
HomeAdvisor Entities, and that therefore there would be substantial uncertainty regarding the prices at which the Class A
shares to be received by Angie's List stockholders who receive the Share Consideration in the Merger may trade following
the Merger; 

• the possibility of significant costs and delays resulting from seeking regulatory approvals necessary to complete the
Transactions, the possibility that the Transactions may not be completed if such approvals are not obtained or if any of the
other conditions to the Closing are not satisfied, and the potential negative impacts on Angie's List, its business, and the
price of Angie's List common stock if such approvals are not obtained or any such other conditions are not satisfied; 

• the fact that the integration of Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business may be complex and time-consuming and may
require substantial resources and effort, and the risk that if ANGI Homeservices does not successfully integrate Angie's List
with the HomeAdvisor Business, the anticipated benefits of the Transactions may not be realized fully or at all or may take
longer to realize than expected; 

• the possibility that strategic and other benefits expected to be created by the combination of Angie's List and the
HomeAdvisor Business following the completion of the Transactions, including expected synergies, may not be realized by
ANGI Homeservices or will take longer to realize than expected; 

• the risks to and costs that could be borne by Angie's List if the Transactions are not completed, including the potential for
diversion of management and employee attention and for increased employee attrition during the period prior to completion
of the Transactions, and the potential effect of the pendency of the Transactions on Angie's List's business and relations
with customers, partners and suppliers; 

• the risk that certain key employees and customers of Angie's List might not choose to remain with the combined company; 

• the restrictions set forth in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of Angie's List's business prior to completion of the
Transactions, which require Angie's List to conduct its business only in the ordinary course, subject to specified limitations,
which could delay or prevent Angie's List from undertaking business opportunities that may arise pending completion of
the Transactions and could negatively impact Angie's List's relationships with its employees, customers, partners or
suppliers;

• the fact that the Merger Agreement prohibits Angie's List from soliciting proposals for alternative transactions prior to the
termination of the Merger Agreement and includes certain restrictions on the ability of Angie's List to engage in
discussions regarding unsolicited proposals for alternative transactions and on the ability of Angie's List to enter into an
alternative transaction, including a termination fee of $20 million that would become payable to IAC if Angie's List were to
terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal, as further described in the sections entitled "The Merger
Agreement—No Solicitation by Angie's List of Alternative Takeover Proposals" and "—Effects of Termination of the
Merger Agreement; Termination Fee and Expenses;" 

• the fact that if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Angie's List will be required to pay a
termination fee of $20 million either upon or following such termination, as further described in the section entitled "The
Merger Agreement—Effects of Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fee and Expenses;" 

• the costs to be incurred by Angie's List in connection with the Transactions; and

Statements" and "Risk Factors."

        In considering the recommendation of the Angie's List board of directors with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement,
you should be aware that some of Angie's List's directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from
yours. The Angie's List board of directors was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the Merger
Agreement and the Transactions, and in recommending that the Merger Agreement be adopted by Angie's List stockholders. See the
section entitled "—Interests of Angie's List's Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions."

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Angie's List board of directors in reaching its conclusions
and recommendations is not intended to be exhaustive, but includes the material factors considered by the Angie's List board of directors.
In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and the complexity of these matters, the Angie's List board of directors did not find it practicable
to, and did not attempt to, quantify, rank or assign any relative or specific weights to the various factors considered in reaching its
determination and making its recommendation. In addition, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. The
Angie's List board of directors considered all of the foregoing factors as a whole and based its recommendation on the totality of the
information presented.

        The foregoing discussion also contains forward-looking statements with respect to future events that may have an effect on Angie's
List's business, financial condition, or results of operations or the future financial performance of ANGI Homeservices. See the sections
entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors."

Opinions of Angie's List's Financial Advisors

Opinion of Allen & Company LLC

        Angie's List has engaged Allen & Company as a financial advisor in connection with the proposed Merger. In connection with this
engagement, Angie's List requested that Allen & Company render an opinion to the Angie's List board of directors as to the fairness, from
a financial point of view, to the holders of Angie's List common stock of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders pursuant

based on and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review
undertaken described in such opinion, the Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Angie's List common stock pursuant to the
Merger Agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

        The full text of Allen & Company's written opinion, dated May 1, 2017, which describes the assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken, is attached as Annex E and is incorporated by reference
herein in its entirety. The description of Allen & Company's opinion set forth in this proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the full text of Allen & Company's opinion. Allen & Company's opinion was intended for the benefit and use of the
Angie's List board of directors (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Consideration from a
financial point of view and did not address any related transactions or any other terms, aspects or implications of the Merger.
Allen & Company's opinion did not constitute a recommendation as to the course of action that Angie's List (or the Angie's List
board of directors) should pursue in connection with the Merger or related transactions or otherwise address the merits of the
underlying decision by Angie's List to engage in the Merger or related transactions, including in comparison to other strategies or
transactions that might be available to Angie's List or which Angie's List might engage in or consider. Allen & Company's opinion
does not constitute advice or a recommendation to any stockholder as to any election made by such stockholder or how such
stockholder should vote or act on any matter relating to the Merger, any related transactions or otherwise.

        Allen & Company's opinion reflected and gave effect to Allen & Company's general familiarity with Angie's List and IAC as well as
information that Allen & Company received during the course of its assignment, including information provided by the managements of
Angie's List, IAC and the HomeAdvisor Business in the course of discussions relating to the Merger and related transactions as more fully
described below. In arriving at its opinion, Allen & Company neither conducted a physical inspection of the properties or facilities of
Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI Homeservices or any other entity or business nor made or obtained any evaluations or
appraisals of the assets or liabilities (contingent, accrued, derivative, off-balance sheet or otherwise) of Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor
Business, ANGI Homeservices or any other entity or business, or conducted any analysis concerning the solvency or fair value of Angie's
List, the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI Homeservices or any other entity or business. Allen & Company assumed, with the consent of
Angie's List, that (i) ANGI Homeservices would retain or acquire all assets, properties and rights necessary for its and its subsidiaries'
operations, (ii) there were no material undisclosed liabilities of or relating to Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI
Homeservices or any other entity or business and, with respect to liabilities that ANGI Homeservices and/or its subsidiaries would assume
in connection with the Merger or related transactions, appropriate reserves, indemnification arrangements or other provisions were or
would be made, and (iii) neither ANGI Homeservices nor any of its subsidiaries would directly or indirectly retain, assume or incur any
liabilities that were contemplated to be excluded as a result of the Merger, related transactions or otherwise.

        In arriving at its opinion, Allen & Company, among other things:

(i) reviewed the financial terms and conditions of the Merger as reflected in a draft, provided to Allen & Company on May 1, 2017, of
the Merger Agreement;

Company were accurate and complete in all respects and fairly represented the items described therein and that, when delivered as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the audited combined and consolidated financial statements and interim combined and
consolidated unaudited financial statements relating to the HomeAdvisor Business would not reflect any information that would be
meaningful in any respect to Allen & Company's analyses or opinion. With respect to the Angie's List forecasts (including, without
limitation, as to net operating loss carryforwards of Angie's List), the HomeAdvisor Business forecasts (including, without limitation,
adjustments and extrapolations prepared by the management of Angie's List), the ANGI Homeservices forecasts and the Synergies that
Allen & Company was directed to utilize for purposes of its analyses, Allen & Company was advised by the management of Angie's List,
and Allen & Company assumed, at the direction of Angie's List, that such financial forecasts, estimates and other financial and operating
data were reasonably prepared in good faith on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of such management
as to, and were a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate, the future financial and operating performance of Angie's List, the
HomeAdvisor Business and ANGI Homeservices, the Synergies and the other matters covered thereby. Allen & Company also assumed,
with the consent of Angie's List, that the financial results, including, without limitation, as to the Synergies, reflected in the financial
forecasts, estimates and other financial and operating data utilized in its analyses would be realized in the amounts and at the times
projected. As the Angie's List board of directors was aware, the management of Angie's List provided potential buyers in connection with
the sale process for Angie's List with certain perspectives regarding illustrative initiatives for Angie's List that Allen & Company was
advised were not expected to be pursued by Angie's List or implemented in the manner then contemplated and such management also
prepared alternative financial forecasts for the HomeAdvisor Business which Allen & Company was advised were not reflective of such
management's views as to the likely future financial performance of the HomeAdvisor Business; accordingly, Allen & Company was
directed not to take into account such initiatives or alternative financial forecasts for purposes of its analyses and opinion. Allen &
Company expressed no opinion or view as to any financial forecasts, estimates or other financial or operating data or the assumptions on
which they were based.

        Allen & Company relied, at the direction of Angie's List, upon the assessments of the managements of Angie's List, IAC and the
HomeAdvisor Business as to, among other things, (i) transactions related to the Merger, including with respect to the timing thereof and
assets, liabilities and financial and other terms involved, (ii) the potential impact on Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business and ANGI
Homeservices of certain market, cyclical, seasonal, competitive and other trends and developments in and prospects for, and
governmental, regulatory and legislative matters relating to or otherwise affecting, the internet and technology industry, including the
digital marketplace services sector thereof, (iii) the technology and intellectual property (and related risks) of Angie's List, the
HomeAdvisor Business and ANGI Homeservices, (iv) existing and future contracts and relationships, agreements and arrangements with,
and the ability to attract, retain and/or replace, key employees, vendors and other commercial relationships of Angie's List, the
HomeAdvisor Business and ANGI Homeservices, and (v) the ability of ANGI Homeservices to integrate the operations of Angie's List
and the HomeAdvisor Business. Allen & Company assumed, with the consent of Angie's List, that there would be no developments with
respect to any such matters that would have an adverse effect on Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI Homeservices, the
Merger or any related transactions (including the contemplated benefits thereof) or that otherwise would be meaningful in any respect to
its analyses or opinion.

        Further, Allen & Company's opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and
the information made available to Allen & Company as of, the date of its opinion. It should be understood that subsequent developments
may affect the conclusion expressed in Allen & Company's opinion and that Allen & Company assumed no responsibility for advising any

Angie's List board of directors was aware, the credit, financial and stock markets, and the industries in which Angie's List and the
HomeAdvisor Business operate, have experienced and continue to experience volatility and Allen & Company expressed no opinion or
view as to any potential effects of such volatility on Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business or ANGI Homeservices (or their respective
businesses), the Merger or related transactions (including the contemplated benefits thereof). In connection with Allen & Company's
engagement and at the direction of the Angie's List board of directors following public announcement by Angie's List that it would explore
its strategic alternatives, discussions were held on behalf of Angie's List with selected third parties regarding their potential interest in a
possible acquisition of Angie's List.

        Allen & Company did not express any opinion as to the fairness, financial or otherwise, of the amount, nature or any other aspect of
any compensation or other consideration payable to any officers, directors or employees of any party to the Merger or related transactions
or any related entities, or any class of such persons or any other party, relative to the Merger Consideration or otherwise. Allen &
Company expressed no opinion as to the actual value of ANGI Homeservices common stock when issued in connection with the Merger
and related transactions or the prices at which Angie's List common stock or ANGI Homeservices common stock (or any other securities)
may trade or otherwise be transferable at any time.

        In addition, Allen & Company expressed no opinion or view as to, and Allen & Company relied, at the direction of Angie's List, upon
the assessments of representatives of Angie's List, IAC and the HomeAdvisor Business regarding, legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and
similar matters relating to Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI Homeservices, the Merger and related transactions, as to which
Allen & Company understood such advice was obtained as deemed necessary from qualified professionals. Allen & Company assumed,
with the consent of Angie's List, that the Merger and related transactions would be consummated in accordance with their respective terms
and in compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements, without waiver, modification or amendment of any
material term, condition or agreement, and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals,
consents, releases, waivers, decrees and agreements for the Merger and related transactions, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition,
including any divestiture or other requirements or remedies, amendments or modifications, would be imposed or occur that would have an
adverse effect on Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI Homeservices, the Merger or related transactions (including the
contemplated benefits thereof) or that otherwise would be meaningful in any respect to its analyses or opinion. Allen & Company also
assumed, with the consent of Angie's List, that the Merger, the Contribution, the IAC Share Issuance and certain other related transactions
would qualify for the intended tax treatment contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Allen & Company further assumed, with the consent
of Angie's List, that the final executed Merger Agreement would not differ from the draft reviewed by Allen & Company in any respect
meaningful to its analyses or opinion.

        Allen & Company evaluated the portion of the Merger Consideration consisting of Share Consideration taking into account the
relative values of Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business based on the relative estimated pro forma equity ownership percentages of
approximately 12.75% and 87.25% that Allen & Company was advised holders of ANGI Homeservices common stock who formerly were
Angie's List securityholders and holders of ANGI Homeservices common stock who formerly were equity holders in the HomeAdvisor
Business, respectively, would hold of the outstanding shares of ANGI Homeservices common stock on a fully diluted basis upon
consummation of the Merger and related transactions assuming, among other things, all outstanding shares of Angie's List common stock
were converted in the Merger into Share Consideration. Allen & Company's opinion did not address related transactions or any other
terms, aspects or implications of the Merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger, the form or structure, or
financial or other terms, of any related transactions or any terms, aspects or implications of the Contribution Agreement

or any investor rights, services or tax sharing agreements, any intercompany note or any governance or other arrangements, agreements or
understandings entered into in connection with, related to or contemplated by the Merger, related transactions or otherwise. Allen &
Company's opinion was limited to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of its date, of the Merger Consideration to be received
by holders of Angie's List common stock pursuant to the Merger Agreement, without regard to individual circumstances of, or allocation
or relative fairness among, holders of Angie's List common stock, ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock or ANGI Homeservices
Class B common stock or any other securities of Angie's List or ANGI Homeservices, or any rights, preferences, restrictions or limitations
(whether by virtue of control, voting, liquidity or otherwise) that may be attributable to any such securities or that may distinguish any
holders thereof, and Allen & Company expressed no opinion or view with respect to any consideration received in connection with the
Merger or related transactions by the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of any party. Except as described
in this summary, Angie's List imposed no other instructions or limitations on the investigations made or procedures followed by Allen &
Company in rendering its opinion.

Miscellaneous

        Angie's List selected Allen & Company as a financial advisor in connection with the Merger based on, among other things, Allen &
Company's reputation, experience and familiarity with the industries in which Angie's List and IAC operate. Allen & Company, as part of
its investment banking business, is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, private placements and related financings, bankruptcy reorganizations and similar recapitalizations, negotiated underwritings,
secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, and valuations for corporate and other purposes. In the ordinary course, Allen &
Company as a broker-dealer and market maker and certain of Allen & Company's affiliates and/or related entities have invested or may
invest, hold long or short positions and may trade, either on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis, for their own account or for those of
Allen & Company's clients, in the debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) of Angie's List, IAC, ANGI Homeservices
and/or their respective affiliates. The issuance of Allen & Company's opinion was approved by Allen & Company's fairness opinion
committee.

        For Allen & Company's financial advisory services, Angie's List has agreed to pay Allen & Company an aggregate cash fee currently
estimated to be approximately $10.4 million, of which a portion was payable upon delivery of Allen & Company's opinion and
approximately $9.2 million is contingent upon consummation of the Merger. Angie's List also agreed to reimburse Allen & Company's
reasonable expenses and to indemnify Allen & Company and related parties against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the
federal securities laws, arising out of its engagement.

        Although Allen & Company did not during the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion provide investment banking services
unrelated to the Merger to Angie's List for which Allen & Company received compensation, Allen & Company may in the future provide
such services to Angie's List and/or its affiliates, for which services Allen & Company would expect to receive compensation. As the
Angie's List board of directors was aware, Allen & Company in the past has provided, and in the future may provide, investment banking
services to IAC and/or its affiliates, for which services Allen & Company has received and/or may receive compensation, including,
during the two-year period prior to the date of its opinion, having acted as a lead bookrunning manager in connection with an initial public
offering of Match Group, Inc., a subsidiary of IAC, as well as assisting IAC in effecting certain share repurchases of IAC common stock,
for which services Allen & Company received during such two-year period aggregate fees of approximately $5.2 million from IAC.

of the Merger Consideration from a financial point of view. BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion did not address any related transactions
or any other terms, aspects or implications of the Merger and no opinion or view was expressed as to the relative merits of the

Angie's List might engage or as to the underlying business decision of Angie's List to proceed with or effect the Merger or related
transactions. BofA Merrill Lynch also expressed no opinion or recommendation as to any election made by a stockholder or how

2019 through 2020 based on guidance from the management of IAC and the HomeAdvisor Business (such forecasts, as adjusted

revenue enhancements (collectively, the "Synergies") anticipated by such management to result from the Merger and related
transactions; 

(v) reviewed certain internal financial and operating information with respect to ANGI Homeservices furnished to or discussed with
BofA Merrill Lynch by the management of Angie's List, IAC and the HomeAdvisor Business, including certain financial forecasts
relating to ANGI Homeservices prepared by the management of Angie's List based on the Angie's List forecasts and the
HomeAdvisor Business forecasts and pro forma for the Merger and related transactions after taking into account the Synergies
(such forecasts, as prepared by such management and approved for BofA Merrill Lynch's use and reliance on behalf of the Angie's
List board of directors by the transaction committee thereof, the "ANGI Homeservices forecasts"); 

(vi) discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor

it and relied upon the assurances of the management of Angie's List, IAC and the HomeAdvisor Business that they were not aware of any
facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. BofA Merrill Lynch
assumed, at the direction of Angie's List, without independent verification, that the internal unaudited financial statements with respect to
the HomeAdvisor Business provided to BofA Merrill Lynch were accurate and complete in all respects and fairly represented the items
described therein and that, when delivered as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the audited combined and consolidated financial
statements and interim combined and consolidated unaudited financial statements relating to the HomeAdvisor Business would not reflect

the Angie's List forecasts (including, without limitation, as to net operating loss carryforwards), the HomeAdvisor Business forecasts
(including, without limitation, adjustments and extrapolations prepared by the management of Angie's List), the ANGI Homeservices
forecasts and the Synergies, BofA Merrill Lynch was advised by Angie's List, and BofA Merrill Lynch assumed, that they were reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of Angie's List as to, and
were a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate, the future financial performance of Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business and ANGI
Homeservices, the Synergies and the other matters covered thereby. BofA Merrill Lynch relied, at the direction of Angie's List, on the
assessments of the management of Angie's List as to ANGI Homeservices' ability to achieve the Synergies and BofA Merrill Lynch was
advised by Angie's List, and BofA Merrill Lynch assumed, that such Synergies would be realized in the amounts and at the times
projected. As the Angie's List board of directors was aware, the management of Angie's List provided potential buyers in connection with
the sale process for Angie's List with certain perspectives regarding illustrative initiatives for Angie's List that BofA Merrill Lynch was
advised were not expected to be pursued by Angie's List or implemented in the manner then contemplated and such management also
prepared alternative financial forecasts for the HomeAdvisor Business which BofA Merrill Lynch was advised were not reflective of such
management's views as to the likely future financial performance of the HomeAdvisor Business; accordingly, BofA Merrill Lynch was
directed not to take into account such initiatives or alternative financial forecasts for purposes of its analyses and opinion. BofA Merrill
Lynch expressed no opinion or view as to any financial forecasts, estimates or other financial or operating information or the assumptions
on which they were based.

        At the direction of Angie's List, BofA Merrill Lynch relied upon the assessments of the management of Angie's List, IAC and the
HomeAdvisor Business as to, among other things, (i) transactions related to the Merger, including with respect to the timing thereof and
assets, liabilities and financial and other terms involved, (ii) the potential impact on Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business and ANGI
Homeservices of certain market, cyclical, seasonal, competitive and other trends and developments in and prospects for, and
governmental, regulatory and legislative matters relating to or otherwise affecting, the internet and technology industry, including the
digital marketplace services sector thereof, (iii) the technology and intellectual property (and related risks) of Angie's List, the
HomeAdvisor Business and ANGI Homeservices, (iv) existing and future contracts and relationships, agreements and arrangements with,
and the ability to attract, retain and/or replace, key employees, vendors and other commercial relationships of Angie's List, the
HomeAdvisor Business and ANGI Homeservices, and (v) the ability of ANGI Homeservices to integrate the operations of Angie's List
and the HomeAdvisor Business. BofA Merrill Lynch assumed, with the consent of Angie's List, that there would be no developments with
respect to any such matters that would have an adverse effect on Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI Homeservices, the
Merger or any related transactions (including the contemplated benefits thereof) or that otherwise would be meaningful in any respect to
BofA Merrill Lynch's analyses or opinion.

        BofA Merrill Lynch did not make and was not provided with any independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities
(contingent, off-balance sheet, accrued, derivative or otherwise) of Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI Homeservices or any
other entity or business, nor did BofA Merrill Lynch make any physical inspection of the properties or assets of Angie's List, the
HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI Homeservices or any other entity or business. BofA Merrill Lynch assumed, with the consent of Angie's
List, that (i) ANGI Homeservices would retain or acquire all assets, properties and rights necessary for its and its subsidiaries' operations,
(ii) there were no material undisclosed liabilities of or relating to Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI Homeservices or any
other entity or business and, with respect to liabilities that ANGI Homeservices and/or its subsidiaries would assume in connection with
the Merger or related transactions, appropriate reserves, indemnification arrangements or other provisions were or would be made, and

liabilities that were contemplated to be excluded as a result of the Merger, related transactions or otherwise. BofA Merrill Lynch did not
evaluate the solvency or fair value of Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI Homeservices or any other entity or business under
any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. BofA Merrill Lynch assumed, at the direction of
Angie's List, that the Merger and related transactions would be consummated in accordance with their respective terms and in compliance
with all applicable laws, documents and other requirements, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material term, condition or
agreement, and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers
for the Merger and related transactions, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or
amendments or modifications, would be imposed or occur that would have an adverse effect on Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business,
ANGI Homeservices, the Merger or related transactions (including the contemplated benefits thereof) or that otherwise would be
meaningful in any respect to BofA Merrill Lynch's analyses or opinion. BofA Merrill Lynch also assumed, at the direction of Angie's List,
that the Merger, the Contribution, the IAC Share Issuance and certain other related transactions would qualify for the intended tax
treatment contemplated by the Merger Agreement. BofA Merrill Lynch further assumed, at the direction of Angie's List, that the final
executed Merger Agreement would not differ in any material respect from the Draft Agreement reviewed by BofA Merrill Lynch.

        BofA Merrill Lynch evaluated the portion of the Merger Consideration consisting of Share Consideration taking into account the
relative values of Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business based on the relative estimated pro forma equity ownership percentages of
approximately 12.75% and 87.25% that BofA Merrill Lynch was advised holders of ANGI Homeservices common stock who formerly
were Angie's List securityholders and holders of ANGI Homeservices common stock who formerly were equity holders in the
HomeAdvisor Business, respectively, would hold of the outstanding shares of ANGI Homeservices common stock on a fully diluted basis
upon consummation of the Merger and related transactions assuming, among other things, all outstanding shares of Angie's List common

or related transactions. BofA Merrill Lynch did not express any opinion as to what the value of ANGI Homeservices common stock
actually would be when issued or the prices at which ANGI Homeservices common stock, Angie's List common stock or any other
securities would trade or otherwise be transferable at any time, including following announcement or consummation of the Merger and
related transactions. BofA Merrill Lynch also expressed no opinion or view with respect to, and BofA Merrill Lynch relied, at the direction
of Angie's List, upon the assessments of representatives of Angie's List, IAC and the HomeAdvisor Business regarding, legal, regulatory,
accounting, tax and similar matters relating to Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI Homeservices, the Merger and related
transactions, as to which BofA Merrill Lynch understood such advice was obtained as deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In
addition, BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no opinion or recommendation as to any election made by a stockholder or how any stockholder
should vote or act in connection with the Merger, any related transactions or any other matter.

        BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, market and other conditions and
circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to BofA Merrill Lynch as of, the date of its opinion. As the Angie's List
board of directors was aware, the credit, financial and stock markets, and the industries in which Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor
Business operate, have experienced and continue to experience volatility and BofA Merrill Lynch expressed no opinion or view as to any
potential effects of such volatility on Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business or ANGI Homeservices (or their respective businesses), the
Merger or related transactions (including the contemplated benefits thereof). It should be understood that subsequent developments may
affect BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion and BofA Merrill Lynch does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion. The
issuance of BofA Merrill Lynch's opinion was approved by a fairness opinion review committee of BofA Merrill Lynch. Except as
described in this summary, Angie's List imposed no other instructions or limitations on the investigations made or procedures followed by
BofA Merrill Lynch in rendering its opinion.

Miscellaneous

        BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, investment
banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Angie's List and certain of its affiliates, and have received or in the future
may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including having acted as financial advisor to Angie's List in connection
with its review of strategic alternatives and related matters. From May 1, 2015 through April 30, 2017, BofA Merrill Lynch and its
affiliates derived aggregate revenues from Angie's List and certain of its affiliates of less than $1 million for investment and corporate
banking services.

        In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide,
investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to IAC and certain of its affiliates and portfolio companies, and have
received or in the future may receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted or acting as a
bookrunning manager and/or underwriter for certain debt and equity offerings of an affiliate of IAC, (ii) having acted as a dealer manager
for a debt tender offer of IAC and debt exchange offer of IAC and an affiliate thereof, (iii) having acted or acting as a bookrunner and

for investment and corporate banking services. BofA Merrill Lynch and certain of its affiliates have been requested to participate as a joint
lead arranger for, and as a lender under, and have indicated a commitment (subject to certain conditions) to provide a portion of the loan
contemplated by, the Credit Agreement for ANGI Homeservices and also have been requested to participate in certain financings for IAC
unrelated to the Transactions, for which BofA Merrill Lynch and/or such affiliates would receive fees currently estimated to be
approximately $900,000 in the aggregate. In the event ANGI Homeservices does not enter into the Credit Agreement, such aggregate fee
is currently estimated to be approximately $600,000.

        In connection with their respective opinions, Allen & Company and BofA Merrill Lynch performed a variety of financial and
comparative analyses, including those described below. The summary of the analyses below and certain factors considered is not a
comprehensive description of all analyses undertaken or factors considered by the Financial Advisors. The preparation of a financial
opinion or analysis is a complex process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial
analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion and analyses are not
readily susceptible to summary description. The Financial Advisors believe that the analyses and factors summarized below must be
considered as a whole and in context. The Financial Advisors further believe that selecting portions of the analyses and factors or focusing
on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses and
factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying the Financial Advisors' analyses and opinions.

        In performing the financial analyses, the Financial Advisors considered industry performance, general business and economic
conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Angie's List and IAC. The estimates of the future performance of
Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business in or underlying the Financial Advisors' analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual
values or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by such analyses.
These analyses were prepared solely as part of the Financial Advisors' analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the
Merger Consideration and were provided to the Angie's List board of directors in connection with the delivery of the Financial Advisors'

respective opinions. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the
prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of
valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described below are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken
as the views of the Financial Advisors regarding the actual values of Angie's List or the HomeAdvisor Business.

        The Financial Advisors did not recommend that any specific consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration in the
Merger or related transactions. The type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger and related transactions was determined
through negotiations between Angie's List and IAC, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by the Angie's List board of
directors. The decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of the Angie's List board of directors. The Financial Advisors'
opinions and analyses were only one of many factors considered by the Angie's List board of directors in its evaluation of the proposed
Merger and the Merger Consideration and should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Angie's List board of directors or
management with respect to the Merger or the consideration payable in the Merger or related transactions.

Financial Analyses

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses provided by the Financial Advisors in connection with their respective
opinions, each dated May 1, 2017, to the Angie's List board of directors. The summary set forth below is not a comprehensive
description of all analyses undertaken by the Financial Advisors in connection with their respective opinions, nor does the order of
the analyses in the summary below indicate that any analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis. The financial
analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses
performed by the Financial Advisors, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by the Financial Advisors. Considering the data set forth in
the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and
assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the financial analyses performed by the
Financial Advisors. Future results may differ from those described and such differences may be material.

        For purposes of the financial analyses described below, the term "adjusted EBITDA" means earnings before interest, income taxes,
depreciation, amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, asset impairment charges and other one-time items, as applicable,
and includes, in the case of the HomeAdvisor Business, shared services expenses. Implied per share equity value reference ranges of
Angie's List reflected in the summaries of the financial analyses described below were rounded to the nearest $0.05 and implied aggregate
equity value reference ranges of the HomeAdvisor Business reflected in the summaries of the financial analyses described below were
rounded to the nearest $5 million.

        In calculating approximate implied exchange ratio reference ranges as reflected in the financial analyses described below, (i) the low
end of each such approximate implied exchange ratio reference range was calculated by dividing (a) the quotient obtained by dividing the
low end of the approximate implied aggregate equity value reference range derived for the HomeAdvisor Business (without reflecting
rounding) by a relative value ratio reflecting relative estimated pro forma equity percentages of 87.25% and 12.75%, by (b) the high end of
the approximate implied aggregate equity value reference range derived for Angie's List and (ii) the high end of each such approximate
implied exchange ratio reference range was calculated by dividing (a) the quotient obtained by dividing the high end of the approximate
implied aggregate equity value reference range derived for the HomeAdvisor

Business (without reflecting rounding) by a relative value ratio reflecting relative estimated pro forma equity percentages of 87.25% and
12.75%, by (b) the low end of the approximate implied aggregate equity value reference range derived for Angie's List. In calculating
approximate implied pro forma equity ownership percentages as reflected in the financial analyses described below, (i) the low end of each
such approximate implied ownership reference range was calculated by dividing the low end of the approximate implied aggregate equity
value reference range derived for Angie's List by the sum of the high end of the approximate implied aggregate equity value reference
range derived for the HomeAdvisor Business (without reflecting rounding) plus the low end of the approximate implied aggregate equity
value reference range derived for Angie's List and (ii) the high end of each such approximate implied ownership reference range was
calculated by dividing the high end of the approximate implied aggregate equity value reference range derived for Angie's List by the sum
of the low end of the approximate implied aggregate equity value reference range derived for the HomeAdvisor Business (without
reflecting rounding) plus the high end of the approximate implied aggregate equity value reference range derived for Angie's List.
Approximate implied exchange ratio reference ranges and pro forma equity ownership reference ranges were calculated before taking into
account Synergies and assuming that all stockholders of Angie's List elected to receive Share Consideration in the Merger.

Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analyses.    The Financial Advisors performed selected publicly traded companies analyses of
Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business in which the Financial Advisors reviewed and compared financial and operating data of
Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business and the selected publicly traded companies listed below.

        Angie's List.    In performing a selected publicly traded companies analysis of Angie's List, the Financial Advisors reviewed publicly
available financial and stock market information of Angie's List and the following eight selected companies that the Financial Advisors
considered relevant as publicly traded companies with operations in the internet and technology industry and calendar year 2016 through
calendar year 2018 estimated revenue compound annual growth rates of less than 10%, referred to as the Angie's List primary selected
companies. The Financial Advisors also reviewed publicly available financial and stock market information of the following nine selected
companies that the Financial Advisors considered generally relevant as publicly traded companies with operations in the internet and
technology industry and calendar year 2016 through calendar year 2018 estimated revenue compound annual growth rates of greater than
10%, referred to as the Angie's List other selected companies.

        The Financial Advisors reviewed, among other information, enterprise values, calculated as fully diluted equity values based on
closing stock prices on April 28, 2017, plus total debt, preferred stock and non-controlling interests and less cash and cash equivalents and
short- and long-term investments, as a multiple of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA. Financial data

based on public filings, publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates and other publicly available information (pro forma, as
applicable, for certain recent acquisitions). Financial data of Angie's List were based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts'
estimates and the Angie's List forecasts.

        The overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the Angie's
List primary selected companies were 7.8x to 18.5x (with a mean of 11.5x and a median of 10.0x) and 5.9x to 14.4x (with a mean of 9.8x

7.9x to 33.4x (with a mean of 16.0x and a median of 14.7x), respectively.

        The Financial Advisors noted that the calendar year 2017 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for Angie's List were 13.2x
(based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates) and 13.9x (based on the Angie's List forecasts), the calendar year
2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for Angie's List were 11.5x (based on publicly available Wall Street research
analysts' estimates) and 8.5x (based on the Angie's List forecasts) and the calendar year 2016 through calendar year 2018 estimated
revenue compound annual growth rates for Angie's List were (1.6%) (based on publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates)
and (2.8%) (based on the Angie's List forecasts). The Financial Advisors then applied selected ranges of calendar year 2017 and calendar
year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples derived from the Angie's List primary selected companies of 8.5x to 10.5x and 8.0x to
10.0x, respectively, to corresponding data of Angie's List utilizing the Angie's List forecasts. This analysis indicated implied aggregate
equity value reference ranges for Angie's List of approximately $229 million to $287 million and $361 million to $457 million,
respectively, resulting in approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Angie's List, based on calendar year 2017 and
calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples, of $3.50 to $4.40 and $5.50 to $6.95, respectively, as compared to the Cash
Consideration of $8.50 per share.

        The Financial Advisors reviewed, among other information and to the extent meaningful, enterprise values, calculated as fully diluted
equity values based on closing stock prices on April 28, 2017, plus total debt, preferred stock and non-controlling interests and less cash
and cash equivalents and short-and long-term investments, as a multiple of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted
EBITDA. Financial data of the HomeAdvisor Business primary selected companies and the HomeAdvisor Business other selected
companies were based on public filings and other publicly available information (pro forma, as applicable, for certain recent acquisitions).
Financial data of the HomeAdvisor Business were based on the HomeAdvisor Business forecasts.

        The overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the
HomeAdvisor Business primary selected companies were 8.9x to 56.6x (with a mean of 21.9x and a median of 18.1x) and 7.9x to 33.4x
(with a mean of 16.0x and a median of 14.7x), respectively. The overall low to high calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated
adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the HomeAdvisor Business other selected companies were 7.8x to 18.5x (with a mean of 11.5x
and a median of 10.0x) and 5.9x to 14.4x (with a mean of 9.8x and a median of 9.1x), respectively.

        The Financial Advisors then applied selected ranges of calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA
multiples derived from the HomeAdvisor Business primary selected companies of 15.0x to 20.0x and 12.0x to 18.0x, respectively, to
corresponding data of the HomeAdvisor Business. This analysis indicated implied aggregate equity value reference ranges for the
HomeAdvisor Business, based on calendar year 2017 and calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples, of approximately
$1,420 to $1,900 and $2,360 to $3,555, respectively.

        Utilizing the approximate implied aggregate equity value reference ranges derived for Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business as
described above, the Financial Advisors calculated the following approximate implied exchange ratio reference ranges, as compared to the
exchange ratio in the Merger of one Class A share of ANGI Homeservices for each outstanding share of Angie's List common stock:

        The Financial Advisors also calculated, based on the approximate implied aggregate equity value reference ranges derived from these
analyses, approximate implied pro forma equity ownership reference ranges for securityholders of Angie's List of 10.7% to 16.8% (based
on calendar year 2017 estimated adjusted EBITDA) and 9.2% to 16.2% (based on calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA),
respectively, as compared to the estimated pro forma equity ownership of securityholders of Angie's List in ANGI Homeservices upon
consummation of the Merger and the related transactions of approximately 12.75%.

        No company or business used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Angie's List or the HomeAdvisor Business.
Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public
trading or other values of the companies or businesses to which Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business were compared.

Selected Precedent Transactions Analysis.    The Financial Advisors reviewed, to the extent publicly available, financial information

and technology industry with next 12 months estimated revenue growth rates of less than 10%, referred to collectively as the selected
transactions:

        The Financial Advisors reviewed, among other information, transaction values of the selected transactions, calculated as the
enterprise values implied for the target companies based on the consideration paid for 100% of the equity value of the target companies,
plus total debt, preferred equity and non-controlling interests (as applicable) and less cash and cash equivalents and unconsolidated assets
(as applicable), as a multiple, to the extent meaningful and publicly available, of the applicable target company's next 12 months estimated
adjusted EBITDA as of the applicable announcement date. Financial data for the selected transactions were based on public filings,
publicly available Wall Street research analysts' estimates and other publicly available information. Financial data of Angie's List were
based on the Angie's List forecasts.

        The overall low to high next 12 months estimated adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the selected transactions were 5.7x to
17.2x (with a mean of 9.7x and a median of 8.7x). The Financial Advisors then applied a selected range of next 12 months estimated
adjusted EBITDA multiples derived from the selected transactions of 8.5x to 12.5x to the calendar year 2017 estimated adjusted EBITDA
of Angie's List. This analysis indicated an implied aggregate equity value reference range for Angie's List of approximately $229 million
to $346 million, resulting in an approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Angie's List of $3.50 to $5.30, as compared
to the Cash Consideration of $8.50 per share.

        Utilizing the approximate implied aggregate equity value reference range derived for Angie's List as described above and the
approximate implied aggregate equity value reference range derived for the HomeAdvisor Business under "—Selected Publicly Traded
Companies Analyses—HomeAdvisor Business" based on the HomeAdvisor Business calendar year 2017 estimated adjusted EBITDA, the
Financial Advisors calculated the following approximate implied exchange ratio reference range, as compared to the exchange ratio in the
Merger of one Class A share of ANGI Homeservices for each outstanding share of Angie's List common stock:

securityholders of Angie's List of 10.7% to 19.6%, as compared to the estimated pro forma equity ownership of securityholders of Angie's
List in ANGI Homeservices upon consummation of the Merger and the related transactions of approximately 12.75%.

        No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor
Business or the Merger. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis
involves complex considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that
could affect the acquisition or other values of the companies, businesses or transactions to which Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business
and the Merger were compared.

Discounted Cash Flow Analyses.    The Financial Advisors performed separate discounted cash flow analyses of Angie's List and the
HomeAdvisor Business.

Allen & Company

        Angie's List.    Allen & Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Angie's List by calculating the estimated present value
(as of December 31, 2016) of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Angie's List was forecasted to generate, based on the
Angie's List forecasts, during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 (assuming
normalized terminal year depreciation and working capital) and after taking into account the estimated present value (as of December 31,
2016) of net operating loss carryforwards of Angie's List. For purposes of this analysis, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash
expense. Allen & Company calculated terminal values for Angie's List by applying to Angie's List's estimated adjusted EBITDA for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 a selected range of adjusted EBITDA multiples of 8.5x to 11.0x. The cash flows, terminal values
and net operating loss carryforwards were then discounted to present value (as of December 31, 2016) using a selected range of discount
rates of 11.5% to 12.3%. This analysis indicated an implied aggregate equity value reference range for Angie's List of approximately
$482 million to $626 million, resulting in an approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Angie's List of $7.30 to $9.40,
as compared to the Cash Consideration of $8.50 per share.

        HomeAdvisor Business.    Allen & Company performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the HomeAdvisor Business by calculating
the estimated present value (as of December 31, 2016) of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that the HomeAdvisor
Business was forecasted to generate, based on the HomeAdvisor Business forecasts, during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017
through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 (assuming normalized terminal year depreciation and working capital). For purposes of
this analysis, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Allen & Company calculated terminal values for the HomeAdvisor
Business by applying to the HomeAdvisor Business's estimated adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 a selected
range of adjusted EBITDA multiples of 10.0x to 14.0x. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value (as of
December 31, 2016) using a selected range of discount rates of 11.3% to 12.3%. This analysis indicated an implied aggregate equity value
reference range for the HomeAdvisor Business of approximately $3,060 million to $4,300 million.

        Utilizing the approximate implied aggregate equity value reference ranges derived for Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business as
described above, Allen & Company calculated the following

approximate implied exchange ratio reference range, as compared to the exchange ratio in the Merger of one Class A share of ANGI
Homeservices for each outstanding share of Angie's List common stock:

        Allen & Company also calculated, based on the approximate implied aggregate equity value reference ranges derived from this
analysis, an approximate implied pro forma equity ownership reference range for securityholders of Angie's List of 10.1% to 17.0%, as
compared to the estimated pro forma equity ownership of securityholders of Angie's List in ANGI Homeservices upon consummation of
the Merger and the related transactions of approximately 12.75%.

BofA Merrill Lynch

        Angie's List.    BofA Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Angie's List by calculating the estimated present
value (as of December 31, 2016) of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Angie's List was forecasted to generate, based
on the Angie's List forecasts, during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020
(assuming normalized terminal year depreciation and working capital) and after taking into account the estimated present value (as of
December 31, 2016) of net operating loss carryforwards of Angie's List. For purposes of this analysis, stock-based compensation was
treated as a cash expense. BofA Merrill Lynch calculated terminal values for Angie's List by applying to Angie's List's estimated adjusted
EBITDA for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 a selected range of adjusted EBITDA multiples of 8.5x to 11.0x. The cash flows,
terminal values and net operating loss carryforwards were then discounted to present value (as of December 31, 2016) using a selected
range of discount rates of 11.5% to 14.0%. This analysis indicated an implied aggregate equity value reference range for Angie's List of
approximately $454 million to $626 million, resulting in an approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Angie's List of
$6.90 to $9.40, as compared to the Cash Consideration of $8.50 per share.

        HomeAdvisor Business.    BofA Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the HomeAdvisor Business by
calculating the estimated present value (as of December 31, 2016) of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that the
HomeAdvisor Business was forecasted to generate, based on the HomeAdvisor Business forecasts, during the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2017 through the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020 (assuming normalized terminal year depreciation and working
capital). For purposes of this analysis, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. BofA Merrill Lynch calculated terminal
values for the HomeAdvisor Business by applying to the HomeAdvisor Business's estimated adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2020 a selected range of adjusted EBITDA multiples of 10.0x to 14.0x. The cash flows and terminal values were then
discounted to present value (as of December 31, 2016) using a selected range of discount rates of 10.0% to 13.0%. This analysis indicated
an implied aggregate equity value reference range for the HomeAdvisor Business of approximately $2,985 million to $4,495 million.

        Utilizing the approximate implied aggregate equity value reference ranges derived for Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business as
described above, BofA Merrill Lynch calculated the following

approximate implied exchange ratio reference range, as compared to the exchange ratio in the Merger of one Class A share of ANGI
Homeservices for each outstanding share of Angie's List common stock:

        BofA Merrill Lynch also calculated, based on the approximate implied aggregate equity value reference ranges derived from this
analysis, an approximate implied pro forma equity ownership reference range for securityholders of Angie's List of 9.2% to 17.3%, as
compared to the estimated pro forma equity ownership of securityholders of Angie's List in ANGI Homeservices upon consummation of
the Merger and the related transactions of approximately 12.75%.

Illustrative Has/Gets Overview.    The Financial Advisors calculated the range of implied per share equity values of ANGI Homeservices
allocable to holders of Angie's List common stock on a pro forma basis assuming a closing date of December 31, 2016 and utilizing the
results of the standalone discounted cash flow analyses for Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business described above after taking into
account potential Synergies (net of after-tax costs to achieve such Synergies) and the net impact of net operating loss carryforwards and
assuming that all stockholders of Angie's List elected to receive in the Merger either (i) Share Consideration (implying an estimated pro
forma equity ownership percentage for securityholders of Angie's List in ANGI Homeservices upon consummation of the Merger and the
related transactions of approximately 12.75%) or (ii) Cash Consideration, subject to proration as contemplated by the Merger Agreement
(implying an estimated pro forma equity ownership percentage for securityholders of Angie's List in ANGI Homeservices upon
consummation of the Merger and the related transactions of approximately 9.70%). The Financial Advisors then compared these implied
per share equity value reference ranges to the implied per share equity value reference ranges derived for Angie's List on a standalone
basis utilizing the results of the standalone discounted cash flow analyses for Angie's List described above. Financial data were based on
public filings, the Angie's List forecasts, the HomeAdvisor Business forecasts and other estimates and data of the management of Angie's
List, excluding the impact of transaction costs. This overview indicated that the Merger could result in incremental value to holders of
Angie's List common stock relative to the implied per share equity value of Angie's List common stock on a standalone basis. Actual
results achieved by Angie's List, the HomeAdvisor Business and the pro forma combined company may vary from forecasted results and
such variations may be material.

Certain Additional Information

        The Financial Advisors observed certain additional information that was not considered part of their financial analyses for their
respective opinions but was noted for informational purposes, including the following:

• historical trading prices of Angie's List common stock during the 52-week period ended April 28, 2017, which indicated
low and high closing prices for Angie's List common stock during such period of approximately $5.29 and $10.67 per
share, respectively; and 

• stock price targets for Angie's List common stock as reflected in selected publicly available Wall Street research analysts'
reports, which indicated an overall low to high target stock price range of $4.75 to $9.00 per share, implying a range of
approximately $4.20 to $8.00 per share on a discounted basis (discounted one year using Angie's List's cost of equity).

Certain Financial Projections

        In connection with the evaluation of a potential sale of Angie's List, Angie's List management prepared long-range financial
projections for the fiscal years 2017 through 2020 for both Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business, which were provided to (i) the
Angie's List board in connection with its evaluation of the Transactions and (ii) Angie's List's financial advisors for their use and reliance
in connection with their financial analyses and respective opinions. The financial projections for Angie's List were also provided to IAC in
connection with its evaluation of the Transactions. In the case of projections related to the HomeAdvisor Business, those projections, a
summary of which is set forth in the table below, were, in part, based upon information regarding the HomeAdvisor Business for the fiscal
years ending December 31, 2017 and 2018 provided to Angie's List by management of IAC and the HomeAdvisor Business. The financial
projections do not, and were not intended to, act as public guidance regarding future financial performance of Angie's List, the
HomeAdvisor Business or ANGI Homeservices.

        The information set forth below is a summary of the financial projections and is included in this proxy statement/prospectus solely to
give Angie's List stockholders access to information regarding the financial projections considered by the Angie's List board of directors in
connection with its evaluation of the Transactions and is not included to influence any stockholder of Angie's List to decide to vote in
favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement or for any other purpose.

        The financial projections reflect Angie's List management's subjective judgment in many respects and, therefore, are susceptible to
multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The financial projections were
necessarily based on a variety of assumptions and estimates. The assumptions and estimates underlying the financial projections may not
be realized and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are
difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of Angie's List, IAC, the HomeAdvisor Business and ANGI Homeservices.
The assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial projections involved judgments with respect to, among other things,
growth rates, market size, required investments and future levels of operating expenses, all of which are difficult to predict and many of
which are outside the control of Angie's List, IAC, the HomeAdvisor Business and ANGI Homeservices. Moreover, the financial
projections were based on expectations regarding certain future business decisions that are subject to change. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that the financial projections, or the assumptions and estimates reflected therein, will be realized, and actual results may
materially differ.

        The inclusion of the summary of the financial projections set forth below in this proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as
an indication that any of Angie's List, IAC, the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI Homeservices or any of their respective affiliates, advisors
or other representatives considered or consider the financial projections to be necessarily predictive of actual future events, and the
summary of the financial projections should not be relied upon as such. None of Angie's List, IAC, the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI
Homeservices or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives has made or makes any representation regarding the
information contained in the financial projections, and except as may be required by applicable securities laws, none of Angie's List, IAC,
the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI Homeservices or any of their respective affiliates intends to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the
financial projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date such financial projections were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of
future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying the financial projections are not realized. The financial
projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared. Further, the financial
projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the Transactions to be consummated. Angie's List stockholders are
cautioned not to rely on the financial projections.

        A summary of the financial projections is set forth below. All amounts are expressed in millions of dollars.

Angie's List

HomeAdvisor Business

        The summary of the financial projections set forth above should be read together with the historical financial statements of Angie's
List, which have been filed with the SEC, and the historical financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business, which are included
elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, as well as the other information regarding Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor Business
contained elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, including the information regarding Angie's List incorporated into this proxy
statement/prospectus by reference. The financial projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they
prepared with a view toward compliance with the published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information. Neither Angie's List's independent
auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the financial
projections summarized above, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its
achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the financial projections.

        Angie's List expects that there will be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be materially greater or
materially less than those contained in the financial projections given numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the
important factors listed under the section entitled "Risk Factors" as well as those set forth in Angie's List's filings with the SEC, including
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. See the section entitled "Where You Can Find More
Information." All projections are forward-looking statements, and these and other forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in
their entirety by the risks and uncertainties identified in these reports and in any other filings with the SEC.

considered the following factors and risks in addition to the specific reasons described above under "—Joint Reasons of Angie's List and
IAC for the Transactions":

• The series of events leading to the potential business combination transaction, as described above under "—Background of
the Transactions." 

• Information concerning the respective businesses, financial results and prospects of Angie's List and the HomeAdvisor
Business, including the results of IAC's due diligence investigation of Angie's List. 

• The expectation that immediately following the Closing, IAC will hold Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices that,
together with Class A shares underlying equity awards in respect of HomeAdvisor (US) to be converted into awards in
respect of ANGI Homeservices, will represent between approximately 87% and 90% of the economic interest (on a fully
diluted basis, calculated using the treasury stock method) and approximately 98% of the total voting power of ANGI
Homeservices common stock, depending on the number of Angie's List stockholders that elect to receive Cash
Consideration. 

• The treatment of vested and unvested equity awards in respect of the common stock of Angie's List and the common stock
of HomeAdvisor (US) in determining the number of ANGI Homeservices Class B shares that IAC will hold upon the
completion of the Transactions. 

• The fact that prior to the Angie's List special meeting, Angie's List may terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter
into a "Superior Proposal," but only if, among other requirements, it has complied with its obligations to negotiate with
IAC to amend the Merger Agreement in order to permit the Transactions to proceed, as further described in the section
entitled "The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation by Angie's List of Alternative Takeover Proposals." 

• The fact that Angie's List would be required in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement in certain
circumstances to pay to IAC a termination fee of $20 million, and the fact that in certain circumstances no termination fee
or expense reimbursement would be payable to IAC if the Merger Agreement were to be terminated because the
stockholders of Angie's List fail to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Angie's List special meeting. 

• The fact that the Merger Agreement provides for the board of directors of ANGI Homeservices at the time of the Closing to
consist of ten directors, with six directors designated by IAC, two directors designated by IAC who qualify as
"independent" pursuant to NASDAQ Rules and the Exchange Act, and two ANGI-Designated Directors. 

• The management team of ANGI Homeservices expected to be in place following the completion of the Transactions,
including the expectation that the chairman of the board of directors of ANGI Homeservices will be Joseph Levin, the
current Chief Executive Officer of IAC, and that the Chief Executive Officer of ANGI Homeservices will be Chris Terrill,
the current Chief Executive Officer of HomeAdvisor (US); and the willingness of Angie Hicks Bowman to continue in an
executive capacity following the Closing. 

• The provisions in the Investor Rights Agreement negotiated by the Angie's List board of directors for the benefit of the
public stockholders of ANGI Homeservices to be applicable during the period from the Effective Time until the date the
2020 annual meeting of stockholders of ANGI Homeservices is held, including: 

• the procedures for selecting a replacement director in the event that one or both of the ANGI-Designated Directors
become unable or unwilling or otherwise cease to serve on the ANGI Homeservices board of directors,

• the prohibition on IAC effecting a "squeeze-out" transaction pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL unless approved
by a committee of independent directors of the ANGI Homeservices board of directors, at least 50% of whom must
be ANGI-Designated Directors so long as any ANGI-Designated Directors who qualify as independent are then
serving on the ANGI Homeservices board, and 

• the requirement that certain transferees of 20% or more of IAC's equity interest in ANGI Homeservices assume
IAC's obligations under the Investor Rights Agreement. 

• The provisions in the Investor Rights Agreement for the benefit of IAC, including, among others: 

• registration rights and preemptive rights to be granted to IAC, 

• the obligation of ANGI Homeservices to cooperate with IAC in the event IAC intends to dispose of all or a portion
of its interest in ANGI Homeservices, 

• IAC's right to assign the Investor Rights Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements to a subsidiary of IAC
holding its interest in ANGI Homeservices in the event of a spin-off of such subsidiary to IAC's stockholders, and 

• ANGI Homeservices' agreement (unless IAC otherwise consents) to avail itself of the exemptions available to a
"controlled company" under NASDAQ Rules so long as IAC's voting interest in ANGI Homeservices exceeds fifty
percent. 

• The provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of ANGI Homeservices to be in effect as of the
Closing, including the limitation of liability in connection with "corporate opportunities" and business initiatives of IAC
and related matters and the availability of an authorized class of non-voting common stock, among others. 

• The restrictions contained in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of the HomeAdvisor Business pending the completion
of the Transactions. 

• The terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, and the provisions in the Ancillary Agreements that will govern the
relationships between ANGI Homeservices and IAC after the Closing. 

• The risk of diverting HomeAdvisor's management focus, employee attention and resources from operational matters and
other strategic initiatives while working to complete the proposed Transactions and successfully integrate Angie's List and
the HomeAdvisor Business. 

• The risk that anticipated cost savings and revenue synergies or other expected benefits of the Transactions will not be
achieved.

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the IAC board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but
includes the material factors considered by the IAC board.

Regulatory Approvals

        The Merger is conditioned on, among other things, the termination or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act. IAC and
Angie's List have each agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Transactions, subject to specified limitations. For additional details, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Efforts to Close the
Merger."

        Pursuant to the HSR Act, IAC filed its Notification and Report Form with the FTC and the DOJ on May 11, 2017. Angie's List filed
its Notification and Report Form with the FTC and DOJ on May 15, 2017. On June 14, 2017, to give additional time to the DOJ to review
the transaction during its

initial review period and thus expedite the DOJ's overall review of the transaction, IAC withdrew its Notification and Report Form and re-
filed it on June 15, 2017. The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act was terminated early by the FTC effective as of July 13, 2017.
As such, this closing condition under the Merger Agreement has been satisfied.

        At any time before or after the Closing, any of the DOJ, the FTC or another person could take action under the antitrust laws as it
deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including without limitation seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Merger,
conditionally approving the Merger upon the divestiture of assets of Angie's List and/or IAC, subjecting the consummation of the Merger
to regulatory conditions or seeking other remedies. The parties do not believe that the Merger violates federal or state antitrust laws, but
there can be no assurance that a challenge to the Merger will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, it will not succeed.

        Neither IAC nor Angie's List is aware of any material governmental approvals or actions that are required for completion of the
Transactions other than as described above. It is presently contemplated that if any such additional governmental approvals or actions are
required, those approvals or actions will be sought. There can be no assurance, however, that any additional approvals or actions will be
obtained.

Listing of Class A Shares of ANGI Homeservices

        IAC and Angie's List have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices to be issued
in connection with the Merger, as well as the Class A shares to be reserved for issuance upon exercise or settlement of options and other of
equity awards of ANGI Homeservices, to be approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, before the Closing.
The approval for listing of the Class A shares is a condition to the Closing (see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conditions
to the Closing of the Merger"). It is currently expected that following the completion of the Transactions, Class A shares of ANGI
Homeservices will trade on NASDAQ under the symbol "ANGI," which is the current ticker symbol for Angie's List.

Delisting and Deregistration of Angie's List Common Stock

        If the Merger is completed, Angie's List common stock, which is currently listed on NASDAQ and traded under the ticker symbol
"ANGI," will be delisted and cease to be quoted on NASDAQ upon the Closing and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act shortly
thereafter.

Dividend Policy of ANGI Homeservices

        ANGI Homeservices has never declared or paid cash dividends on its capital stock, and ANGI Homeservices has not yet determined
whether, when and in what amounts it may pay cash dividends on its Class A common stock, Class B common stock or Class C common
stock (if any is outstanding) in the future. Future determinations relating to ANGI Homeservices' dividend policy will be made by its board
of directors following the Merger and will depend on a number of factors, including:

• its historic and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of operations; 

• its capital levels and needs; 

• tax considerations; 

• any acquisitions or potential acquisitions that ANGI Homeservices may consider; 

• statutory and regulatory prohibitions and other limitations; 

• the terms of any credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements that restrict its ability to pay cash dividends;

• other factors deemed relevant by the ANGI Homeservices board of directors.

        ANGI Homeservices is not obligated to pay dividends on its Class A common stock, its Class B common stock or its Class C
common stock.

        As a Delaware corporation, ANGI Homeservices will be subject to certain restrictions on dividends under the DGCL. Generally, a
Delaware corporation may only pay dividends either out of "surplus" or out of the current or the immediately preceding year's net profits.
Surplus is defined as the excess, if any, at any given time, of the total assets of a corporation over its total liabilities and statutory capital.
The value of a corporation's assets can be measured in a number of ways and may not necessarily equal their book value.

Accounting Treatment of the Merger

        ANGI Homeservices will account for the acquisition of Angie's List pursuant to the Merger using the acquisition method of
accounting in accordance with GAAP. ANGI Homeservices will measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values,
including net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as of the Closing. Any excess of the purchase
price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill.

        Definite lived intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and
goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually. All intangible assets and goodwill are also tested for
impairment when certain indicators are present, which may occur more frequently than on an annual basis.

        The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined
financial statements (see the section entitled "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information") is based on preliminary
estimates using assumptions that the management of ANGI Homeservices believes are reasonable based on currently available information
as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. The final purchase price and fair value assessment of assets and liabilities will be
completed following the Closing based in part on a detailed analysis that has not yet been completed.

No Appraisal Rights

        Appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable stockholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction,
such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding
instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction.

        Appraisal rights are not available in all circumstances, and exceptions to these rights are provided under the DGCL. Section 262 of
the DGCL provides that stockholders have the right, in some circumstances, to dissent from certain corporate actions and to instead
demand payment of the fair value of their shares. Stockholders do not have appraisal rights with respect to shares of any class or series of
stock if such shares of stock, or depositary receipts in respect thereof, are either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of
record by more than 2,000 holders, unless the stockholders are required to receive in exchange for their shares anything other than shares
of stock of the surviving or resulting corporation (or depositary receipts in respect thereof), or of any other corporation that is publicly
listed or held by more than 2,000 holders of record, cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depositary receipts described above or
any combination of the foregoing. Therefore, because Angie's List common stock is listed on NASDAQ, and because Angie's List
stockholders are not required to accept in the Merger any consideration in exchange for their shares of Angie's List common stock other
than Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices, which will be publicly listed on NASDAQ, and cash in lieu of fractional shares (if
applicable), holders of Angie's List common stock

will not be entitled to any appraisal rights in connection with the Transactions with respect to their shares of Angie's List common stock.

Interests of Angie's List's Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions

        Angie's List stockholders should be aware that some of Angie's List's directors and officers have interests in the Merger and have
arrangements that are different from, or in addition to, those of Angie's List stockholders generally. Angie's List's board of directors was
aware of these interests and considered these interests, among other matters, when making its decision to approve the Merger Agreement,
and in recommending that Angie's List stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. See the sections entitled "The
Transactions—Background of the Transactions" and "—Angie's List's Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the Angie's List
Board of Directors."

Treatment of Angie's List Stock Options

        Each option to purchase shares of Angie's List common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, as of
the Effective Time, be converted into an option to purchase (i) that number of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices equal to the total
number of shares of Angie's List common stock subject to such Angie's List option immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) at a per-
share exercise price equal to the exercise price per share of Angie's List common stock at which such Angie's List option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each ANGI Homeservices option will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including vesting) as applied to the corresponding Angie's List option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Treatment of Angie's List Restricted Stock Unit Awards

        Each award of restricted stock units that corresponds to shares of Angie's List common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will, as of the Effective Time, be converted into an ANGI Homeservices restricted stock unit award with respect to a
number of Class A shares equal to the number of shares of Angie's List common stock subject to such restricted stock unit award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming satisfaction of any applicable performance goals at the target performance level with
respect to Angie's List performance-based restricted stock unit awards granted in June 2016). Each ANGI Homeservices restricted stock
unit award will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as applied to the corresponding Angie's List
restricted stock unit award immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that ANGI Homeservices restricted stock unit awards
corresponding to performance-based Angie's List restricted stock unit awards granted in June 2016 will vest solely on the basis of service
following the Effective Time.

Angie's List Employment Agreements and Offer Letters with Angie's List's Executive Officers

        Angie's List has entered into an employment agreement or offer letter with each of its executive officers, other than Ms. Hicks
Bowman, which provides for payments and benefits in the event of a termination of the executive officer's employment by Angie's List
without cause or by the executive officer with good reason (each of which is referred to in this section as a "qualifying termination"), in
each case, during a specified period prior to or following a change in control. The Merger will constitute a change in control under these
employment agreements and offer letters.

Scott A. Durchslag

        The employment agreement with Scott A. Durchslag, Angie's List's President and Chief Executive Officer, provides that, in the event
of his qualifying termination within the six-month period prior to or 18-month period following the Effective Time, Mr. Durchslag will be
eligible to receive the following:

Thomas R. Fox

        The offer letter with Thomas R. Fox, Angie's List's Chief Financial Officer, provides that, in the event of his qualifying termination

termination date, less all applicable taxes and withholdings, and (ii) reimbursement of 18 months of COBRA premium payments that
Angie's List then pays on behalf of similarly situated active employees (provided Mr. Fox is eligible for and timely elects to continue
receiving group medical insurance pursuant to COBRA).

J. Mark Howell

        The offer letter with J. Mark Howell, Angie's List's Chief Operating Officer, provides that, in the event of his qualifying termination
within the six-month period prior to or 12-month period following the Effective Time, Mr. Howell will be eligible to receive the following:
(i) a cash payment equal to two years of his then-current annual base salary, payable in one lump sum on the 60th day following his
termination date, less all applicable taxes and withholdings, and (ii) reimbursement of 18 months of COBRA premium payments that
Angie's List then pays on behalf of similarly situated active employees (provided Mr. Howell is eligible for and timely elects to continue
receiving group medical insurance pursuant to COBRA).

Shannon M. Shaw

        The offer letter with Shannon M. Shaw, Angie's List's Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary, provides that, in the event of her
qualifying termination within the three-month period prior to or the 18-month period following the Effective Time, Ms. Shaw will be
eligible to receive the following: (i) a cash payment equal to two years of her then-current annual base salary, payable in one lump sum on
the 60th day following her termination date, less all applicable taxes and withholdings, and (ii) a lump sum payment equal to 18 months of

equal to two years of his then-current annual base salary, payable in one lump sum on the 60th day following his termination date, less all
applicable taxes and withholdings, and (ii) a lump sum payment equal to 18 months of the cost of COBRA payments, payable on the
60th day following his termination date.

        The employment agreements or offer letters with each of Angie's List's executive officers provide that payments and benefits that are
subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code will be cut back in certain circumstances such that no payments or benefits are
subject to the excise tax. The employment agreement with Mr. Durchslag and the offer letter with Mr. Brown each provide for a 12-month
post-termination noncompetition covenant. All of the severance payments and benefits described above are contingent on the executive
officer's execution and non-revocation of a separation and release agreement provided by Angie's List.

        For an estimate of the severance payments and benefits that would be payable to each of Angie's List's named executive officers upon
a qualifying termination following the Merger, see "—Golden Parachute Compensation" below. The estimated aggregate amount of
severance benefits that would be payable to Angie's List's two executive officers who are not named executive officers if the Effective
Time occurred on August 23, 2017 and they experienced a qualifying termination on that date is $1,274,555.

Equity Acceleration

        The terms of the agreements for stock options granted during 2013 and later to Angie's List's named executive officers (other than for
Mr. Durchslag's at-hire grant in 2015, as described below) provide for accelerated vesting if the named executive officer's employment is
terminated within the six-month period prior to, or 18-month period following, a change in control. The terms of the stock option award
agreements for Angie's List's other executive officers provide for accelerated vesting if the executive officer's employment is terminated
within the 12-month period following a change in control. The terms of the stock option award agreements for Angie's List's non-
employee directors provide for accelerated vesting upon a change in control, whether or not the service of the non-employee director is
terminated in connection with the change in control. The Merger will constitute a change in control for this purpose. No non-employee
directors hold any unvested stock options.

        The terms of the restricted stock unit award agreements for executive officers (other than for Mr. Durchslag's at-hire grant in 2015, as
described below) provide that, if within 12 months following a change in control, the employment of the executive officer is terminated
without cause or he or she resigns for good reason, the vesting of the restricted stock unit award will be accelerated automatically and will
become fully vested upon such termination of employment or service. With respect to restricted stock unit awards granted to non-
employee directors, such awards will be accelerated automatically and become fully vested upon a change in control if they are either not
substituted, assumed or otherwise continued in connection with the change in control or if a termination of service of the non-employee
director occurs in connection with the change in control. The Merger will constitute a change in control for this purpose.

        The terms of the performance-based restricted stock unit award agreements for executive officers (other than for Mr. Durchslag's at-
hire grant in 2015, as described below) provide that in the event of a change in control of Angie's List prior to the conclusion of the 33-
month performance period applicable to those awards, the Adjusted EBITDA and Total Cumulative Revenue performance conditions will
be deemed satisfied, with the Total Cumulative Revenue goal deemed satisfied at the target performance level, and each holder of such an
award will remain subject to the service-based vesting conditions set forth under the award agreement. In the event an executive officer
experiences a termination of service without cause or resigns for good reason, in each case, within 18 months following a change in
control, and provided that within 60 days following the executive officer's

termination date, the executive officer timely executes and does not revoke a separation agreement releasing Angie's List and its affiliates
from all claims, a pro-rated portion of the performance-based restricted stock unit award will vest based on the number of full months
during the performance period that the executive officer was employed by Angie's List. The Merger will constitute a change in control for
this purpose.

        Mr. Durchslag's employment agreement provides that, in the event of a qualifying termination within the six-month period prior to or
18-month period following a change in control and subject to Mr. Durchslag's execution and non-revocation of a separation agreement
releasing Angie's List and its affiliates from all claims, the at-hire equity awards granted to Mr. Durchslag pursuant to his employment
agreement will vest, with applicable performance goals being deemed satisfied at the greater of actual performance through the date of his
termination of employment and 100% of the target level of performance.

        For an estimate of the amounts that would be payable to each of Angie's List's named executive officers upon settlement of their
unvested Angie's List equity awards upon a qualifying termination, see "—Golden Parachute Compensation" below. The estimated
aggregate amount that would be payable to Angie's List's two executive officers who are not named executive officers in settlement of
their unvested Angie's List equity awards if the Effective Time occurred on August 23, 2017 and they experienced a qualifying termination
on that date is $3,377,305. Angie's List's eight non-employee directors only hold unvested annual restricted stock awards granted in 2017,
and Angie's List estimates that the aggregate amount that would be payable to Angie's List's eight non-employee directors for their
unvested Angie's List equity awards if the Effective Time occurred on August 23, 2017 is $1,580,467. The amounts in this paragraph are
determined using a per share price of Angie's List common stock of $10.40, the average closing price per share of Angie's List common
stock over the first five business days following the announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement.

Grants to Strategic Advisory Committee Members

        The compensation committee of the Angie's List board of directors approved the grant of cash payments to certain Angie's List
directors who serve on the Strategic Advisory Committee of the Angie's List board of directors in recognition of their additional efforts
and contributions in the following amounts: (i) $35,000 to each of George D. Bell, David B. Mullen and H. Eric Semler, and (ii) $50,000
to Thomas R. Evans. These cash payments will be paid at or just prior to the Closing.

Golden Parachute Compensation

        In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the tables below present the estimated amounts of compensation that each named
executive officer of Angie's List could receive that are based on or otherwise relate to the Merger. This compensation is referred to as
"golden parachute" compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules, and in this section such term is used to describe the Merger-
related compensation that may become payable to Angie's List's named executive officers. This Merger-related compensation will be the
subject of a non-binding advisory vote of Angie's List stockholders at the special meeting. See the section entitled "Proposal 2: Advisory
Vote on Executive Compensation."

        The amounts set forth below have been calculated assuming completion of the Merger on August 23, 2017, the latest practicable date
prior to the filing of this proxy statement/prospectus, and, where applicable, assuming each named executive officer experiences a
qualifying termination as of August 23, 2017. In addition, the amounts below are determined using a price per share of Angie's List
common stock of $10.40, the average closing price per share of Angie's List common stock over the first five business days following the
announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement. The amounts indicated below are estimates of amounts that would be payable to
Angie's List's named executive officers, and the estimates are based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur, including
assumptions described in this proxy statement/prospectus. Some of the assumptions are

account the effect of the new agreement between ANGI Homeservices and Ms. Hicks Bowman, which is described below in the section
entitled "—ANGI Homeservices Employment Agreement with Ms. Hicks Bowman." All dollar amounts set forth below have been
rounded to the nearest whole number.

Board Composition

        At the Effective Time, the board of directors of ANGI Homeservices will consist of six members designated by IAC, an additional
two directors designated by IAC who will qualify as "independent" pursuant to the NASDAQ Rules and the Exchange Act, and two
directors selected by Angie's List from the Angie's List board of directors, who will be Thomas R. Evans and Angela R. Hicks Bowman, if
they continue to be able and willing to serve. ANGI Homeservices has not entered into and does not plan to enter into an employment
agreement with Mr. Evans, although he will be entitled to compensation for his service as a non-employee member of the board of
directors, as described in the section entitled "ANGI Homeservices Director Compensation." ANGI Homeservices has entered into an
employment agreement with Ms. Hicks Bowman, which is summarized below. For further information regarding the composition of the
ANGI Homeservices board of directors from and after the Effective Time, see the section entitled "Board of Directors and Executive
Officers of ANGI Homeservices Following the Merger."

ANGI Homeservices Employment Agreement with Ms. Hicks Bowman

        On June 29, 2017, ANGI Homeservices and Ms. Hicks Bowman entered into an employment agreement, pursuant to which
Ms. Hicks Bowman will serve as the Chief Customer Officer of ANGI Homeservices following the completion of the Transactions. The
employment agreement has a scheduled term of one year from the date of completion of the Transactions and provides for automatic
renewals for successive one-year terms absent written notice from ANGI Homeservices or Ms. Hicks Bowman 60 days prior to the
expiration of the then-current term.

        The employment agreement provides that Ms. Hicks Bowman will be eligible to receive an annual base salary of $500,000,
discretionary annual cash bonuses, equity awards and such other employee benefits as may be reasonably determined by the Compensation
and Human Resources Committee of the ANGI Homeservices board of directors. Under the terms of the employment agreement,
following the completion of the Transactions, Ms. Hicks Bowman will be granted an option to purchase 250,000 shares of Class A
common stock of ANGI Homeservices that will vest 25% per year on the first four anniversaries of the grant date, subject to Ms. Hicks
Bowman's continued employment with ANGI Homeservices, and will have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Class A
common stock of ANGI Homeservices on the grant date.

        Upon certain involuntary terminations of Ms. Hicks Bowman's employment and subject to her execution and non-revocation of a
release and compliance with the restrictive covenants described in the next paragraph: (i) ANGI Homeservices will continue to pay
Ms. Hicks Bowman her annual base salary for one year following such termination, (ii) any Angie's List equity awards that convert into
equity awards of ANGI Homeservices will vest as of such date of termination, (iii) all vested and outstanding ANGI Homeservices stock
options held by Ms. Hicks Bowman as of the date of such termination will remain outstanding and exercisable for 18 months from the date
of such termination, and (iv) ANGI Homeservices will provide continued health benefits coverage for 12 months following the termination
of Ms. Hicks Bowman's employment.

terminates the officer's employment without cause or the officer terminates his or her employment for good reason,
in each case within six months prior to or 18 months following the change in control (for Mr. Durchslag) or within
six months prior to or 12 months following the change in control (for Messrs. Fox and Howell) or within three
months prior to or 18 months following the change in control (for Ms. Shaw). The COBRA premiums under the
applicable employment agreements or offer letters are described in more detail above in the section entitled "—

Homeservices during the term of her employment and for 12 months after certain involuntary terminations and covenants not to solicit
IAC's employees or business partners during the term of her employment and for 18 months after such a termination. In addition,
Ms. Hicks Bowman has agreed not to use or disclose any confidential information of IAC or its affiliates. The employment agreement also

        The employment agreement with Ms. Hicks Bowman will become effective subject to, and upon the consummation of, the
Transactions.

Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance

        Angie's List is party to indemnification agreements with each of its directors and executive officers that require Angie's List, among
other things, to indemnify the directors and executive officers against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as
directors or officers. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Angie's List's directors and executive officers will be
entitled to certain ongoing indemnification from ANGI Homeservices and the surviving corporation in the Merger and coverage under
directors' and officers' liability insurance policies. Such indemnification and insurance coverage is further described in the section entitled
"The Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance for Angie's List's Directors, Officers and Employees."

Other

        Ms. Hicks Bowman and Mr. Evans are the only current Angie's List directors or officers that are expected to join either the board of
directors or the executive management team of ANGI Homeservices.

Litigation Related to the Merger

        On July 18, 2017, a putative class action complaint, captioned Parshall v. Angie's List,  Inc., C.A. No. 1:17-cv-02418 (the "Parshall
Action"), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana in connection with the Merger. On July 20, 2017, a
similar class action lawsuit was filed in the same court, captioned Pill v. Angie's List, Inc., C.A. No. 1:17-cv-02461 (the "Pill Action")
(together, the two actions are referred to as the "Actions"). The complaints in both the Parshall Action and the Pill Action named as
defendants ANGI Homeservices, Merger Sub, IAC, Angie's List and the members of the Angie's List board of directors.

        The complaints in the Actions allege that Angie's List, the members of the Angie's List board of directors, IAC, ANGI Homeservices
and Merger Sub allegedly omitted and/or misrepresented certain information in the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part in violation of the Exchange Act and related SEC regulations. The alleged omissions and/or
misrepresentations generally relate to (i) certain of Angie's List's and the HomeAdvisor Business's financial projections, (ii) certain data
and inputs underlying the financial analyses, (iii) certain interests of Angie's List's directors and executive officers in the Transactions, and
(iv) the background of the Transactions.

        The Actions collectively seek the following relief: (i) ordering that the Actions be maintained as a class action and certifying the
plaintiffs as the class representative and the plaintiff's counsel as class counsel, (ii) preliminarily and permanently enjoining the defendants
and all persons acting in concert with them from proceeding with, consummating or closing the Transactions, (iii) directing the Angie's
List board of directors to disseminate a Form S-4 that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all material
facts required in it or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading, (iv) in the event the defendants consummate the
Transactions, rescinding them and setting them aside or awarding rescissory damages to the plaintiffs and the class,

(v) declaring that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and/or
Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, (vi) directing the defendants to account to the plaintiffs and the class for damages sustained,
(vii) awarding the plaintiffs the costs of the Actions, including reasonable allowance for plaintiffs' attorneys and experts' fees, and
(viii) granting such other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper.

        The defendants consider the claims asserted to be without merit. Notwithstanding that belief, one of the conditions to the Closing is
that no court or other governmental authority in a competent jurisdiction (which would include the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of Indiana) has issued an injunction or similar order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions.
As such, if the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, then such injunction may
prevent the Merger from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.

Transactions that is contained in (including the information incorporated by reference into) this proxy statement/prospectus. See the
section entitled "Where You Can Find More Information."

        The Merger Agreement and this summary of its terms have been included in this proxy statement/prospectus to provide you with
information regarding the terms of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement and this summary are not intended to provide any other

concerning the subject matter of these representations, warranties and covenants may have changed after the date of the Merger
Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in public disclosures by Angie's List, IAC, ANGI
Homeservices or their respective subsidiaries and affiliates.

The Merger, the Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration

        The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the Contribution Agreement,
prior to the Closing, IAC will contribute its HomeAdvisor Business, along with cash sufficient to fund the aggregate Cash Consideration,
if any, to ANGI Homeservices in exchange for Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices. For further details regarding the Contribution, see
the section entitled "Ancillary Agreements—Contribution Agreement." At the Effective Time, Merger Sub will merge with and into
Angie's List, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and Angie's List will continue as the surviving company in the
Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of ANGI Homeservices.

        At the Effective Time, each share of Angie's List common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares owned or held in treasury by Angie's List, which will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist for no consideration)
will be converted into the right to receive, at the holder's election (i) in the case of a share of Angie's List common stock with respect to
which an election to receive a Class A share of ANGI Homeservices has been properly made and not revoked or lost, one Class A share
(the "Share Consideration" which, together with the Share Consideration, is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the "Merger
Consideration") or (ii) in the case of a share of Angie's List common stock with respect to which an election to receive cash has been
properly made and not revoked or lost, $8.50 in cash, without interest (the "Cash Consideration"), but subject to the proration provisions
described below.

Table of Contents

        There is no requirement for any Angie's List stockholder to receive Cash Consideration in the Merger. If no Angie's List stockholder
elects to receive the Cash Consideration, 100% of the consideration paid in the Merger will be in the form of Class A shares of ANGI
Homeservices (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares, if applicable).

        Immediately following the Closing, depending on the number of Angie's List stockholders that elect to receive Cash Consideration,
former holders of Angie's List common stock and equity awards are expected to hold, in the aggregate, Class A shares representing
between approximately 10% (assuming Angie's List stockholders elect to receive the maximum aggregate Cash Consideration) and 13%
(assuming no Angie's List stockholders elect to receive Cash Consideration) of the economic interest in ANGI Homeservices common
stock (on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury stock method), and less than 2% of the total voting power of ANGI
Homeservices common stock, and IAC is expected to hold Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices which, together with Class A shares
underlying equity awards in respect of HomeAdvisor (US) to be converted into awards in respect of ANGI Homeservices, will represent
between approximately 87% and 90% of the economic interest (on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury stock method) and
approximately 98% of the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices common stock.

        ANGI Homeservices will not issue any fractional Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices in the Merger. Instead, in lieu of any
fractional Class A shares, the exchange agent (as described below under "—Exchange Agent; Exchange and Payment Procedures") will
issue a cash payment (without interest) in an amount representing the applicable Angie's List stockholder's proportionate interest in the net
proceeds from the sale by the exchange agent of the aggregated amount of all such fractional Class A shares that would otherwise have
been issued.

        No right to fair value or appraisal or similar rights will be available to Angie's List stockholders with respect to the Merger or the
other Transactions.

Treatment of Angie's List Equity Awards in the Merger

        Options.    Each option to purchase shares of Angie's List common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will, as of the Effective Time, be converted into an option to purchase (i) that number of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices equal to
the total number of shares of Angie's List common stock subject to such Angie's List option immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) at
a per-share exercise price equal to the exercise price per share of Angie's List common stock at which such Angie's List option was
exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each ANGI Homeservices option will otherwise be subject to the same terms and
conditions (including vesting) as applied to the corresponding Angie's List option immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        Restricted Stock Unit Awards.    Each award of restricted stock units that corresponds to shares of Angie's List common stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, as of the Effective Time, be converted into an ANGI Homeservices restricted
stock unit award with respect to a number of Class A shares equal to the number of shares of Angie's List common stock subject to such
restricted stock unit award immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming satisfaction of any applicable performance goals at the target
performance level with respect to Angie's List performance-based restricted stock unit awards granted in June 2016). Each ANGI
Homeservices restricted stock unit award will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as applied to the
corresponding Angie's List restricted stock unit award immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that ANGI Homeservices restricted
stock unit awards corresponding to performance-based Angie's List restricted stock unit awards granted in June 2016 will vest solely on
the basis of service following the Effective Time.

Closing of the Merger; Closing Date and Effective Time

        Unless IAC and Angie's List otherwise agree, the closing of the Merger, which is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the
"Closing," will take place (i) on September 29, 2017, if all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in the Merger Agreement have been
satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived, other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing or (ii) if such conditions have not been satisfied or
waived on September 29, 2017, on the third business day after all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in the Merger Agreement have
been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waived, other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing. For further details regarding these conditions, see
the section entitled "—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger." The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to in this proxy
statement/prospectus as the "Closing Date."

        Concurrently with the Closing, Angie's List and Merger Sub will cause a certificate of merger effecting the Merger to be filed with
the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Merger will become effective at the time the certificate of merger is filed, unless the parties to the
Merger Agreement agree to make the Merger effective at another, later date and/or time and specify such time in the certificate of merger.
The time at which the Merger is deemed effective under Delaware law is referred to in this proxy statement/prospectus as the "Effective
Time."

        IAC and Angie's List expect the Closing to occur in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2017, subject to the adoption of the
Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of the other conditions to the Merger. See the section
entitled "—Conditions to the Closing of the Merger."

Election Procedures for the Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration; Aggregate Cap and Possible Proration of the Cash
Consideration

        Merger Consideration Elections.    Pursuant to the election procedures described below, each Angie's List stockholder will be able to
specify whether such stockholder desires to receive, in exchange for each share of Angie's List common stock held by such stockholder as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, either (i) one Class A share of ANGI Homeservices or (ii) $8.50 in cash, without interest. The
election form will permit Angie's List stockholders to choose (1) all Share Consideration, (2) all Cash Consideration or (3) Share
Consideration for specified shares of Angie's List common stock held by such stockholder and Cash Consideration for other specified
shares of Angie's List common stock held by such stockholder. The election form will also permit each Angie's List stockholder to specify
the order in which the election should apply if the election is subject to proration of the Cash Consideration, as described below. Any share
of Angie's List common stock for which the exchange agent does not receive an effective, properly completed election on or before the
election deadline described below will receive Share Consideration in the Merger.

        There is no requirement for any Angie's List stockholder to receive Cash Consideration in the Merger. If no Angie's List stockholder
elects to receive the Cash Consideration, 100% of the consideration paid in the Merger will be in the form of Class A shares of ANGI
Homeservices (other than cash in lieu of fractional shares, if applicable).

        Consideration Election Forms and Procedures.    Angie's List will cause to be mailed or delivered an election form to each Angie's
List stockholder as of the close of business on August 25, 2017, which is the record date for the Angie's List special meeting. Angie's List
will mail the election forms at least 20 business days prior to the anticipated election deadline. The election forms are expected to be
mailed on or around August 30, 2017. Angie's List will also make available election forms as may be reasonably requested by anyone who
becomes an Angie's List stockholder after the record date for the

Table of Contents

Angie's List special meeting and prior to the election deadline. The deadline for returning the election forms will be 5:00 p.m. Eastern time
on September 28, 2017, the day prior to the date of the Angie's List special meeting, unless another date is agreed in advance by Angie's
List and IAC (in which case Angie's List will reasonably promptly announce the rescheduled election deadline). An election will have
been properly made only if the exchange agent has received, by the election deadline, an election form properly completed and signed and
accompanied by (i) the Angie's List stock certificates, if any, to which such election form relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in
form acceptable for transfer on the books of Angie's List, and (ii) in the case of book-entry shares of Angie's List common stock, any
additional documents specified in the procedures set forth in the election form. The exchange agent will have reasonable discretion to
determine if any election is not properly made, and none of Angie's List, IAC, ANGI Homeservices, Merger Sub or the exchange agent
will have any duty to notify any Angie's List stockholder of any defective election form or election.

        Changes to Elections Previously Made.    Any Angie's List stockholder may, at any time prior to the election deadline, change or
revoke such stockholder's election by written notice received by the exchange agent prior to the election deadline, accompanied by a
properly completed and signed revised election form, or by withdrawal prior to the election deadline of such stockholder's Angie's List
stock certificates or any documents in respect of book-entry shares of Angie's List previously deposited with the exchange agent. An
election may not be revoked after the election deadline. A revocation of an election prior to the election deadline is required in connection
with any transfer of shares of Angie's List common stock as to which an election has been properly made. As a result, following the
election deadline until the Closing, Angie's List stockholders will not be able to transfer (including by sale) any shares of Angie's List
common stock for which an election has been properly made. Any and all elections will be automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by
the exchange agent of written notice from Angie's List or IAC that the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

        Aggregate Cash Consideration Cap and Proration Procedures.    Under the Merger Agreement, the aggregate Cash Consideration
payable in the Merger is capped at $130 million.

        If the aggregate number of shares of Angie's List common stock in respect of which Cash Consideration is properly elected (as
described above) is less than or equal to 15,294,118 shares (which is the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate Cash Consideration
cap of $130 million by $8.50, the per-share Cash Consideration amount), then (i) all shares of Angie's List common stock for which Cash
Consideration was properly elected will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and (ii) all other shares of Angie's
List common stock (other than shares owned or held in treasury by Angie's List, which will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease
to exist for no consideration) will be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration in the Merger, including any shares of
Angie's List common stock for which no election is properly made.

        However, if the aggregate number of shares of Angie's List common stock in respect of which Cash Consideration is properly elected
exceeds 15,294,118 shares, then (i) all shares of Angie's List common stock for which Share Consideration was properly elected will be
converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration and (ii) the number of shares of Angie's List common stock of each stockholder
of Angie's List who properly elected to receive Cash Consideration that will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration
will be equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares for which such Angie's List stockholder properly elected the
Cash Consideration by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is 15,294,118, and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of
shares for which all Angie's List stockholders properly elected the Cash Consideration, rounded to the nearest whole share. All other
shares of Angie's List common stock (other than shares owned or held in treasury by Angie's List, which will automatically be cancelled,
retired and cease to exist for no consideration) will be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration in the Merger, including
any shares of Angie's List common stock for which no election

is properly made. As an illustration of this possible outcome, if the exchange agent has received proper elections (not properly withdrawn)
for the Cash Consideration in respect of 25,000,000 shares of Angie's List common stock as of the election deadline, then an Angie's List
stockholder who properly elected to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of 10 shares of Angie's List common stock will receive the
Cash Consideration in respect of six of those shares (or $51 in the aggregate), and the Share Consideration in respect of the other four
shares for which Cash Consideration was elected. This illustrative proration is calculated as the product of (i) the quotient of 15,294,118
divided by 25,000,000 (the number of shares for which Cash Consideration was properly elected), which equals 0.612, multiplied by
(ii) 10, the number of shares of Angie's List common stock in respect of which the hypothetical stockholder properly elected the Cash
Consideration. This amount (6.12) is then rounded to the nearest whole number, which is 6, and the stockholder will receive $51 in
exchange for six shares of Angie's List common stock (i.e., 6 multiplied by $8.50). Had the aggregate Cash Consideration cap not been
exceeded (i.e., if the Cash Consideration was properly elected in respect of 15,294,118 or fewer shares of Angie's List common stock in
the aggregate), then the hypothetical stockholder would have received $85 in cash, without interest, in respect of such stockholder's 10
shares, and no Share Consideration.

Determination of the Number of Class B Shares of ANGI Homeservices to Be Issued to IAC

        Prior to the Effective Time, IAC will contribute its HomeAdvisor Business, along with cash sufficient to fund the aggregate Cash
Consideration, if any, to ANGI Homeservices in exchange for Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices. For further details regarding the
Contribution, see the section entitled "Ancillary Agreements—Contribution Agreement." The number of Class B shares to be issued to
IAC in connection with the Contribution will be calculated by IAC on the business day prior to the anticipated Closing Date, based on the
number of shares of Angie's List common stock, Angie's List equity awards and HomeAdvisor stock appreciation rights, in each case,
outstanding as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on the second business day prior to the anticipated Closing Date.

        Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the number of Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices to be issued to IAC in connection with the
Contribution will equal the sum of (i) the quotient, rounded to the nearest whole number, of (1) (a) the HomeAdvisor Allocation of
Combined Company Implied Value (as defined below) less (b) the sum of (x) the aggregate value of the spread between the exercise price
and the implied HomeAdvisor share price of specified vested HomeAdvisor stock appreciation rights outstanding as of immediately prior
to the anticipated Effective Time and (y) 50% of the aggregate value of the spread between the exercise price and the implied share price
of specified unvested HomeAdvisor stock appreciation rights outstanding as of immediately prior to the anticipated Effective Time (each
computed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement) divided by (2) the Unaffected ANGI Price (as defined
below), plus (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Angie's List common stock for which Cash Consideration has been properly elected
(unless such number exceeds the maximum number of shares for which Cash Consideration may become payable under the Merger
Agreement, in which case this last number will be capped at 15,294,118).

        Under the Merger Agreement, the "HomeAdvisor Allocation of Combined Company Implied Value" is defined as the product,
rounded to the nearest whole cent, of (i) the sum of (1) the product of (a) the number of shares of Angie's List common stock that will be
outstanding as of immediately prior to the anticipated Effective Time, excluding any shares of common stock scheduled to be issued in
respect of Angie's List restricted stock unit awards between the measurement time and the anticipated Effective Time (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluding any Angie's List shares held in treasury or held by a subsidiary of Angie's List), multiplied by (b) the
average of the daily dollar-volume-weighted average price for Angie's List common stock on NASDAQ for each of the ten trading days
immediately preceding the anticipated Closing Date, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the Merger Agreement if such average
trading price is less than $8.50 (such average trading price, after any such required adjustment, the "Unaffected ANGI Price"), plus (2) the
product of (a) the net value of

Table of Contents

the Angie's List equity awards outstanding as of immediately prior to the anticipated Effective Time (computed in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement) multiplied by (b) the quotient of the Unaffected ANGI Price divided by the average of the
daily dollar-volume-weighted average price for Angie's List common stock on NASDAQ for each of the ten trading days immediately
preceding the anticipated Closing Date (which may or may not be equal to one), multiplied by (ii) 6.6923 (which is 0.87 divided by 0.13).

        Immediately following the Closing, depending on the number of Angie's List stockholders that elect to receive Cash Consideration,
former holders of Angie's List common stock and equity awards are expected to hold, in the aggregate, Class A shares representing
between approximately 10% (assuming Angie's List stockholders elect to receive the maximum aggregate Cash Consideration) and 13%
(assuming no Angie's List stockholders elect to receive Cash Consideration) of the economic interest in ANGI Homeservices common
stock (on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury stock method), and less than 2% of the total voting power of ANGI
Homeservices common stock, and IAC is expected to hold Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices which, together with Class A shares
underlying equity awards in respect of HomeAdvisor (US) to be converted into awards in respect of ANGI Homeservices, will represent
between approximately 87% and 90% of the economic interest (on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury stock method) and
approximately 98% of the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices common stock.

        Within two business days after the first anniversary of the Closing Date, ANGI Homeservices and IAC will calculate the number of
Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices underlying the Angie's List equity awards assumed by ANGI Homeservices in the Merger that
were forfeited during the period commencing at the Closing and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date. (i) If the actual
number of such forfeited shares exceeds 2,300,000 (which is the number of forfeited shares assumed for purposes of the calculation to be
made prior to the Closing), then a number of Class B shares held by IAC equal to the number of such excess will be cancelled, thereby
reducing IAC's proportionate ownership of ANGI Homeservices relative to the holders of Class A shares, and (ii) if the actual number of
such forfeited shares is less than 2,300,000, then a number of additional Class B shares will be issued to IAC equal to the number of such
deficit, thereby increasing IAC's proportionate ownership of ANGI Homeservices relative to the holders of Class A shares.

Governance of ANGI Homeservices and Organizational Documents of ANGI Homeservices and Angie's List Following the Closing

        ANGI Homeservices.    At or prior to the Closing, IAC will cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of ANGI Homeservices
to be amended and restated in their entirety to read as set forth in the exhibits to the Merger Agreement, and as so amended and restated,
those will be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of ANGI Homeservices until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms
and applicable law. For details regarding certain terms of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated
bylaws of ANGI Homeservices that will be in effect at the Closing, see the sections entitled "Description of ANGI Homeservices Capital
Stock" and "Comparison of the Rights of Angie's List Stockholders and Holders of Class A Shares of ANGI Homeservices."

        The Merger Agreement provides that the initial board of directors of ANGI Homeservices will consist of ten directors, with six
directors designated by IAC, two directors designated by IAC who qualify as "independent" pursuant to NASDAQ Rules and the

Homeservices, see the section entitled "Board of Directors and Executive Officers of ANGI Homeservices Following the Merger."

        The Merger Agreement also provides that at the Closing, IAC and ANGI Homeservices will enter into the Investor Rights
Agreement, the terms of which are described in the section entitled "Ancillary Agreements—Investor Rights Agreement."

        Angie's List.    From and after the Effective Time, Angie's List will be a wholly owned subsidiary of ANGI Homeservices. The
Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Angie's List will be amended and
restated in their entirety to read as set forth in the applicable exhibits to the Merger Agreement. The forms of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Angie's List that will become effective at the Effective Time are different from the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws of Angie's List in effect as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, with many of the changes made to reflect that
Angie's List will be a wholly owned subsidiary of ANGI Homeservices (and will no longer have public stockholders) from and after the
Effective Time. However, the forms of certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Angie's List that will become effective at the Effective
Time include provisions regarding exculpation of directors, indemnification of and advance of expenses to directors and officers, and the
power of Angie's List to purchase and maintain related insurance that are substantially identical to those set forth in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Angie's List in effect as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus. The forms of certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Angie's List that will become effective at the Effective Time are included as exhibits to the registration
statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part and are incorporated into this proxy statement/prospectus by reference.

Exchange Agent; Exchange and Payment Procedures

        Prior to the Closing, IAC will enter into an agreement with a bank or trust company to act as exchange agent on behalf ANGI
Homeservices for payment of the Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration (if any) in the Merger. The identity and the terms of
appointment of the exchange agent must be reasonably acceptable to Angie's List. The parties expect that Computershare Trust
Company, N.A. and Computershare, Inc. will serve as the exchange agent.

        Prior to the Closing, IAC will deposit or cause ANGI Homeservices to deposit with the exchange agent (i) evidence of Class A shares
of ANGI Homeservices in book-entry form (and/or stock certificates, at IAC's election) representing the number of Class A shares issuable
in the Merger and (ii) cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to deliver the aggregate Cash Consideration properly
elected to be received by Angie's List stockholders pursuant to the election procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement.

        As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing (and no later than the tenth business day after the Closing Date), ANGI
Homeservices will cause the exchange agent to mail to each holder of record of Angie's List common stock whose shares were converted
into the right to receive the Share Consideration and/or the Cash Consideration a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Angie's List stock certificates or book-entry shares in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration.

        Upon surrender of Angie's List stock certificates or book-entry shares to the exchange agent, along with a completed and signed letter
of transmittal and any other documents as may customarily be required by the exchange agent, the holder of the surrendered shares will be
entitled to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in exchange for such surrendered shares as promptly as practicable after the
Closing (and no later than five business days after the Closing and the surrender of such shares, whichever is later). No interest will accrue
or be paid on any cash payable upon surrender of

any Angie's List shares. The amount of any Merger Consideration to be paid to any Angie's List stockholder may be reduced as required
by any applicable tax laws.

        If any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the exchange agent is not claimed within 180 days of the Closing Date,
then it will be delivered to ANGI Homeservices upon its demand. Thereafter, any Angie's List stockholder who has not complied with the
exchange procedures of the Merger Agreement may thereafter look only to ANGI Homeservices or Angie's List (subject to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws) as general creditor for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration. None of IAC, ANGI
Homeservices, Angie's List, Merger Sub or the exchange agent will be liable to any person for any portion of the Merger Consideration or
amounts deposited with the exchange agent that are delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. Any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains undistributed to Angie's List stockholders as of the second anniversary
of the Closing Date (or immediately prior to any earlier date on which the applicable Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any governmental entity) will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Angie's List as the
surviving company in the Merger, free and clear of all claims or interest of any other person.

        The letter of transmittal will include instructions for obtaining payment of the Merger Consideration if an Angie's List stockholder
has lost his, her or its stock certificate or if such certificate has been stolen, mutilated or destroyed. If an Angie's List stockholder has lost a
stock certificate, or if such certificate has been stolen, mutilated or destroyed, then before such stockholder will be entitled to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration, such stockholder will have to make an affidavit of the loss, theft, mutilation or destruction and may be
required to post a bond in such amount as ANGI Homeservices or the exchange agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made with respect to such lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed certificate.

Representations and Warranties; Material Adverse Effect

        Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Angie's List, on the one hand, and IAC, ANGI Homeservices and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
have made certain representations and warranties to each other as of the date of the Merger Agreement. These representations and

        Certain of the representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement are qualified as to "materiality" or "material adverse
effect." None of the representations and warranties set forth in the Merger Agreement will survive the Closing, and the Merger Agreement
does not contain any post-closing indemnification obligations with respect to breaches of any of the representations and warranties.

        For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a "material adverse effect" with respect to either Angie's List or the HomeAdvisor Business
means any event, circumstance, change, effect, development, occurrence or combination of the foregoing that individually or in the
aggregate (i) prevents, materially impedes or materially delays, or would prevent, materially impede or materially delay, the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, or (ii) has had a material adverse effect on the business, condition (financial or
otherwise) or results of operations of Angie's List and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole (in the case of a material adverse effect on Angie's
List), or the HomeAdvisor Business (in the case of a material adverse effect on it). However, in the case of the foregoing clause (ii), no
event, circumstance, change, effect, development or occurrence resulting from or arising out of any of the following will be deemed (either
alone or in combination) to constitute a "material adverse effect":

• changes in general economic, business, credit, capital or other financial market conditions (including prevailing interest
rates);

Angie's List only) changes in the market price or trading volume of Angie's List common stock or the credit rating of
Angie's List (although the underlying facts giving rise or contributing to any failure or change described in this bullet point
may be taken into account in determining whether there has been a "material adverse effect" if such failure or change is not
otherwise excluded by another of the bullet points listed in this paragraph).

        However, with respect to the matters described in the first, second, fifth and sixth bullet points listed above, an event, circumstance,
change, effect, development or occurrence may be taken into account in determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred if and
to the extent that such event, circumstance, change, effect, development or occurrence disproportionately affects (i) in the case of Angie's
List, Angie's List and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other similarly situated companies in the industries in which Angie's
List and its subsidiaries conduct their business or (ii) in the case of the HomeAdvisor Business, the HomeAdvisor Business, taken as a

        Definition of Company Takeover Proposal.    For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a "Company Takeover Proposal" means (i) any
inquiry, proposal or offer for or with respect to (or expression by any person that it is considering or may engage in) a merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, binding share exchange, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or other similar
transaction involving Angie's List or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, taken together, constitute 15% or more of Angie's List's
consolidated assets, (ii) any inquiry, proposal or offer (including a tender or exchange offer) to acquire in any manner, directly or
indirectly, in one or more transactions, more than 15% of the outstanding common stock of Angie's List or securities of Angie's List
representing more than 15% of the voting power of Angie's List or (iii) any inquiry, proposal or offer to acquire in any manner (including
the acquisition of stock in any subsidiary of Angie's List), directly or indirectly, in one or more transactions, assets or businesses of Angie's
List or its subsidiaries, including pursuant to a joint venture, representing more than 15% of the consolidated assets, revenues or net
income of Angie's List, in each of the foregoing cases, excluding the Merger.

        Additional Restrictions.    Additionally, except as specifically permitted by the Merger Agreement, Angie's List is prohibited from
taking any action to exempt any person from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL or the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Angie's List, or otherwise causing such restrictions not to apply. Unless the Angie's List board of
directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that any such action or forbearance would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, Angie's List and its subsidiaries are prohibited from
releasing any third party from, or waiving, amending or modifying any provision of, or granting permission under any (i) standstill

provision in any agreement to which Angie's List or any of its subsidiaries is a party or (ii) confidentiality provision in any agreement to
which Angie's List or any of its subsidiaries is a party (excluding any waiver, amendment, modification or permission under a
confidentiality provision that does not, and would not reasonably be likely to, facilitate or encourage a Company Takeover Proposal).

        Exception for Superior Proposals.    However, notwithstanding the restrictions described above, if at any time from and after May 1,
2017 and prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders (but not after), (i) Angie's List receives a bona fide,
unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal from any person that did not result from, directly or indirectly, a breach of the non-
solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement and (ii) the Angie's List board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below) and, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then Angie's List may:

• furnish, pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement with provisions no less favorable in the aggregate to Angie's
List than those applicable to IAC in its confidentiality agreement with Angie's List, information (including nonpublic
information) with respect to Angie's List and its subsidiaries, and afford access to the business, properties, assets,
employees, officers, contracts, books and records of Angie's List and its subsidiaries, to the person that made such
Company Takeover Proposal and its representatives (so long as Angie's List provides to IAC any nonpublic information
concerning Angie's List or any of its subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its representatives
substantially concurrently with its delivery to such person); and 

• engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Company Takeover Proposal
(including making counterproposals) and its representatives regarding such Company Takeover Proposal.

        Definition of Superior Proposal.    For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide, unsolicited
written Company Takeover Proposal (i) that if consummated would result in a third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such
third party and Angie's List, the shareholders of such third party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the outstanding
Angie's List common stock or more than 50% of the assets of Angie's List and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) that the Angie's List
board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, is reasonably
capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory, timing and other aspects of such proposal, including all
conditions contained therein and the person making such Company Takeover Proposal and (iii) that the Angie's List board of directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel (taking into account any changes to
the Merger Agreement proposed by IAC in response to such Company Takeover Proposal, and all financial, legal, regulatory, timing and
other aspects of such Company Takeover Proposal, including all conditions contained therein and the person making such proposal, and
the Merger Agreement), is more favorable to the stockholders of Angie's List from a financial point of view than the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

        Notice Requirements.    Angie's List must promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt) notify IAC of any Company
Takeover Proposal received by Angie's List or its representatives. The notice must include the identity of the person making the proposal
and the material terms and conditions of the proposal. The notice must also include unredacted copies of any written proposal received and
indicate whether Angie's List has furnished nonpublic information to, or entered into discussions or negotiations with, such third party.
Angie's List must keep IAC reasonably informed on a

reasonably current basis as to the status of (including changes to any material terms of, and any other material developments with respect
to) any such Company Takeover Proposal.

Change in the Angie's List Board Recommendation

        Restrictions on Changes to the Angie's List Board Recommendation.    As further described in the sections entitled "The Transactions
—Joint Reasons of Angie's List and IAC for the Transactions" and "—Angie's List's Reasons for the Transactions; Recommendation of the
Angie's List Board of Directors," and subject to the provisions described below, the Angie's List board of directors recommends that
Angie's List stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, which recommendation is referred to in this section as
the "Angie's List board recommendation."

        Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Angie's List has agreed that its board of directors will not:

• fail to include the Angie's List board recommendation in this proxy statement/prospectus; 

• change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to IAC, the Angie's List board recommendation; 

• make, or publicly propose to make, any recommendation in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer (other than a
recommendation against such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act); 

• fail to recommend against any Company Takeover Proposal or fail to reaffirm the Angie's List board recommendation
within five business days after a request by IAC to do so, subject to certain exceptions and limitations; or 

• resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any of the foregoing actions.

        Any action described in the foregoing five bullet points is referred to in this section as an "adverse recommendation change."

        In addition, the Angie's List board of directors may not authorize, approve or recommend or cause or permit Angie's List or any of its
subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement, commitment or agreement in principle providing for any Company Takeover
Proposal (other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement as described above under "—No Solicitation by Angie's List of Alternative
Takeover Proposals").

        Exception for Superior Proposals.    However, notwithstanding the restrictions on changes to the Angie's List board recommendation
described above, at any time prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders, the Angie's List board of
directors may make an adverse recommendation change with respect to a Superior Proposal and/or cause Angie's List to terminate the
Merger Agreement (which will require concurrent payment of the termination fee to IAC as described below) in order to enter into a
definitive agreement providing for the consummation of the transaction contemplated by such Superior Proposal, in either case if:

• Angie's List is not in breach of the non-solicitation provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement; and 

• after receiving a bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from, directly or indirectly, a
breach of the non-solicitation provisions set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Angie's List board of directors has
determined in good faith: 

• after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and

• after consultation with its outside legal counsel, in light of such Company Takeover Proposal, that the failure to
make such an adverse recommendation change or terminate the Merger Agreement would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with the Angie's List board of directors' fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        Prior to making any adverse recommendation change or terminating the Merger Agreement as described in the preceding paragraph,
Angie's List must comply with the following procedures:

• Angie's List must give IAC at least three business days' prior written notice of its intention to make such an adverse
recommendation change (and the notice must specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal) and
must contemporaneously provide IAC with a copy of the Superior Proposal and a copy of any written proposed transaction
documents relating to such Superior Proposal (including any financing commitments related thereto); 

• Angie's List must negotiate in good faith with IAC during such notice period, to the extent IAC wishes to negotiate in good
faith, to enable IAC to propose revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement such that it would cause such Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; 

• following the end of such notice period, the Angie's List board of directors must have considered in good faith any
revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed in writing by IAC, and must have determined, after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal even if the revisions proposed by IAC were to be given effect; and 

• in the event of any change to any material terms of such Superior Proposal, Angie's List must have delivered to IAC an
additional notice consistent with that described in the first bullet point of this paragraph and a new notice period of two
business days (rather than three business days) will then commence, during which time Angie's List must comply with the
requirements of the preceding three bullet points anew.

        Exception for Intervening Events.    Additionally, notwithstanding the restrictions on changes to the Angie's List board
recommendation described above, the Angie's List board of directors may make an adverse recommendation change in response to an
Intervening Event (as defined below) if the Angie's List board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that its failure to make an adverse recommendation change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
law. Prior to making any adverse recommendation change in response to an Intervening Event, Angie's List must comply with the
following procedures:

• Angie's List must give IAC at least four business days' prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and the
notice must specify in reasonable detail the reasons for the adverse recommendation change; 

• Angie's List must negotiate and direct its representatives to negotiate in good faith with IAC during such notice period, to
the extent IAC wishes to negotiate in good faith, to enable IAC to propose revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement
such that it would not permit the Angie's List board of directors to make an adverse recommendation change under the
Merger Agreement; and 

• following the end of such notice period, the Angie's List board of directors must have considered in good faith any
revisions to the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by IAC, and must have determined, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to make an adverse recommendation change in response to such Intervening Event
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Table of Contents

        For purposes of the Merger Agreement, an "Intervening Event" means any material event or material development or material change
in circumstances first occurring or arising after May 1, 2017 and prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Angie's List
stockholders, if and only if such event, development or change in circumstances was neither known by the Angie's List board of directors
(or if known, the consequences of which were not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Angie's List board of directors) as of or prior
to May 1, 2017. However, none of the following may constitute an Intervening Event: (i) the receipt, existence or terms of a Company
Takeover Proposal, (ii) changes in and of themselves in the market price or trading volume of Angie's List common stock or IAC common
stock or (iii) the fact in and of itself that Angie's List or IAC or the HomeAdvisor Business meets or exceeds or fails to meet or exceed
internal or published projections, forecasts or revenue or earnings predictions for any period (although the exceptions described in
clauses (ii) and (iii) will not exclude any event, development or change in circumstance underlying any such change in market price or
trading volume, or meeting or exceeding, or failure to meet or exceed such projections, forecasts or predictions).

        If the Angie's List board of directors makes an adverse recommendation change in response to an Intervening Event, Angie's List will
nonetheless continue to be obligated to hold a special meeting of stockholders and submit the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement to
its stockholders.

Efforts to Close the Merger

        Under the Merger Agreement, each of Angie's List and IAC must use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken and to do
or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Transactions, including:

• making filings and responding to inquiries under the HSR Act; 

• defending any lawsuit or other proceeding challenging the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions;
and 

• executing and delivering any additional instruments or documents necessary to consummate the Transactions or to fully
carry out and document the intent of the Merger Agreement and the other agreements contemplated thereby.

        IAC and Angie's List agreed to file their respective initial pre-merger notifications under the HSR Act no later than ten business days
after the date of the Merger Agreement. IAC and Angie's List filed such notifications on May 11, 2017 and May 15, 2017, respectively. On
June 14, 2017, to give additional time to the DOJ to review the transaction during its initial review period and thus expedite the DOJ's
overall review of the transaction, IAC withdrew its Notification and Report Form and re-filed it on June 15, 2017. The applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act was terminated early by the FTC effective as of July 13, 2017. See the section entitled "The Transactions—
Regulatory Approvals."

        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing obligations, but subject to the limitations described in the following two paragraphs,
under the Merger Agreement IAC must and must cause its subsidiaries to use its and their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
Transactions, including taking all such further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as any governmental entity
may assert under any antitrust or competition law with respect to the Transactions, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any such law that may be asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the

Closing to occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than February 1, 2018), including by:

• proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of ANGI Homeservices or any of its subsidiaries (including
HomeAdvisor (US) and its subsidiaries and Angie's List and its subsidiaries after the Closing); and 

• otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that after the Closing would limit the freedom of ANGI Homeservices
or its subsidiaries (including HomeAdvisor (US) and its subsidiaries and Angie's List and its subsidiaries after the Closing)
with respect to, or their ability to retain, one or more of their businesses, product lines or assets, in each case as may be
required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any order, injunction or judgment that would
otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond February 1, 2018.

        However, IAC and its subsidiaries will only become subject to, or be required to consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with
respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order described in the preceding paragraph if it is binding only in the
event that the Closing occurs. Additionally, any proposed sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of ANGI
Homeservices or any of its subsidiaries may only occur following the Contribution, and the proceeds of any such sale, divestiture or
disposition will be paid to ANGI Homeservices.

        Moreover, notwithstanding the preceding two paragraphs, neither IAC nor any of its subsidiaries or affiliates will be required to offer
or commit to hold separate, sell, divest or dispose of any assets or businesses of IAC or any of its subsidiaries (including ANGI
Homeservices, HomeAdvisor (US) and its subsidiaries and Angie's List and its subsidiaries after the Closing) that would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect as measured against Angie's List.

Efforts to Hold the Special Meeting of Angie's List Stockholders to Adopt the Merger Agreement

        Subject to specified rights of Angie's List and IAC in certain circumstances to postpone or adjourn the special meeting, Angie's List
has agreed to hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable for the purpose of obtaining its stockholders'
adoption of the Merger Agreement. Angie's List must use its reasonable best efforts to (i) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the adoption of the Merger Agreement and (ii) take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders
required by the NASDAQ Rules or applicable laws to obtain such approvals.

Indemnification and Insurance for Angie's List's Directors, Officers and Employees

        Under the Merger Agreement, ANGI Homeservices and Merger Sub have agreed that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses existing as of May 1, 2017 for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing in favor of the current or
former directors, officers or employees of Angie's List or its subsidiaries as provided in their respective organizational documents or in any
agreement will survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect.

        Additionally, for a period of six years from the Closing Date, ANGI Homeservices and Angie's List must maintain in effect (to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law) any and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the
organizational documents of Angie's List or any of its subsidiaries that were in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any
indemnification agreements of Angie's List or its subsidiaries with any of their respective current or former directors, officers or
employees in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and must not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions or the
exculpation, indemnification or

advancement of expenses provisions of the organizational documents of Angie's List in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
of any individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of Angie's List or
any of its subsidiaries.

        Moreover, Angie's List (as the surviving company in the Merger) must, and ANGI Homeservices must cause Angie's List to, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing to) each
current and former director, officer or employee of Angie's List or any of its subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer,
member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of Angie's List or any of its subsidiaries, in each case against any costs or expenses,
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or omission by them in their capacities
as such occurring or alleged to have occurred whether commenced before or after the Closing.

        Moreover, for a period of six years from the Closing Date, ANGI Homeservices must cause to be maintained in effect the coverage
provided by the policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance of Angie's List and its subsidiaries in
effect as of May 1, 2017, or provide substitute policies for Angie's List and its current and former directors and officers who are covered
by such directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage, in either case, of not less than the amounts of
such existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and officers' liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance coverage with respect to matters existing or arising on or before the Effective Time, including the
Transactions. However, ANGI Homeservices will not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid by Angie's List prior to May 1, 2017 in respect of the insurance coverage required to be obtained, but in such case will be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage possible that does not exceed 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to May 1, 2017. If
(i) Angie's List elects, with the prior written consent of IAC, or (ii) IAC elects, then prior to the Closing Angie's List or IAC, as applicable,
may (at the cost of ANGI Homeservices) purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred
prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed by such indemnified parties in their capacity as such
(and if such a "tail policy" is purchased, ANGI Homeservices will have none of the other obligations described in this paragraph).

Other Covenants and Agreements

        The Merger Agreement contains certain other covenants and agreements, including those relating to the following:

• cooperation between Angie's List and IAC in the preparation of this proxy statement/prospectus; 

• confidentiality and access by IAC and Angie's List to the representatives of and specified information about the other party
during the period prior to the Closing; 

• cooperation between Angie's List and IAC in connection with public announcements relating to the Transactions;

• IAC must have received a written opinion from Wachtell Lipton, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to IAC,
dated as of the Closing Date, and based on the facts, representations, assumptions and exclusions set forth or referred to in
such opinion, to the effect that the Contribution and the IAC Share Issuance, taken together, will qualify as an exchange as
described in Section 351(a) of the Code.

        Neither IAC nor Angie's List can be certain when or if the conditions to the Merger described above will be satisfied (or waived), or
that the Merger will be completed in a timely manner or at all. For further details regarding the risks associated with the Merger, see the
section entitled "Risk Factors."

Termination of the Merger Agreement

        Angie's List and IAC may mutually agree to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time prior to the completion of the Merger
(including after the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders).

        In addition, either IAC or Angie's List may terminate the Merger Agreement if:

• the Merger is not consummated on or prior to February 1, 2018 (provided that this right to terminate will not be available to
a party if the failure of the Closing to occur by such date was due to a material breach of the Merger Agreement by such
party); 

• an injunction or other order is entered by a court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and such
injunction or other order has become final and nonappealable (provided that this right to terminate will not be available to a
party if the injunction was primarily due to the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations under the Merger
Agreement); 

• the Angie's List special meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) has concluded without the
adoption of Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders; or 

• the other party (as referring to IAC in this bullet point, "the other party" also includes ANGI Homeservices and Merger
Sub) has breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the
Merger Agreement, and such breach or failure to perform (i) if it occurred on or continued to occur on the Closing Date,
would result in a failure of a condition to the Closing to be satisfied by such breaching party, and (ii) is incapable of being
cured by February 1, 2018 or, if curable by such date, is not cured within 20 business days of receipt of written notice from
the other party (provided that this right to terminate will not be available to a party if such party is then in material breach
of the Merger Agreement and such breach would result in a failure of a condition to the Closing to be satisfied by such
party).

        IAC may also terminate the Merger Agreement prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders if the
Angie's List board of directors makes an adverse recommendation change as described above under "—Change in the Angie's List Board
Recommendation."

        Angie's List may also terminate the Merger Agreement prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by its stockholders in order to
enter into a definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, as described above under "—No Solicitation by Angie's List of
Alternative Takeover Proposals" (but only if Angie's List enters into such definitive agreement concurrently with the termination of the
Merger Agreement and pays the termination fee described below).

Effects of Termination of the Merger Agreement; Termination Fee and Expenses

        Except as described below, each party to the Merger Agreement will pay all fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with the
Merger and the other Transactions, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

        If the Merger Agreement is validly terminated, there will be no liabilities or obligations on the part of any party to the Merger
Agreement except for (i) any liabilities arising out of the confidentiality agreement between Angie's List and IAC, (ii) the termination fee
described below and (iii) liabilities arising out of or the result of fraud or any willful and material breach of the Merger Agreement
occurring prior to its termination, in which case the aggrieved party will not be limited to expense reimbursement or the termination fee
described below and will be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity. The provisions of the Merger Agreement
relating to the effects of termination, fees and expenses, termination payments, governing law, jurisdiction, specific enforcement, waiver of
jury trial and nonsurvival of representations and warranties, as well as the confidentiality agreement entered into between Angie's List and
IAC, will continue in effect notwithstanding any termination of the Merger Agreement.

        Angie's List will be obligated to pay IAC a termination fee of $20 million in any of the following circumstances:

• if Angie's List terminates the Merger Agreement prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by its stockholders in order
to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal; 

• if IAC terminates the Merger Agreement prior to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders
because the Angie's List board of directors makes an adverse recommendation change; or 

• if a Company Takeover Proposal (as defined above under "—No Solicitation by Angie's List of Alternative Takeover
Proposals," except that all references to "15%" in that definition will be deemed references to "50%" for purposes of this
termination fee trigger) has been made or communicated to the Angie's List board of directors or has been publicly
announced or become publicly known and: 

• such Company Takeover Proposal has not been publicly withdrawn at least five business days prior to the Angie's
List special meeting, and the Merger Agreement is later terminated because the Angie's List special meeting
concludes without the adoption of Merger Agreement proposal by Angie's List stockholders; or 

• such Company Takeover Proposal has not been withdrawn prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement due to
(i) the Merger having not been consummated by February 1, 2018 or (ii) Angie's List having breached or failed to
perform under the Merger Agreement in a manner that causes the closing condition relating to the performance by
Angie's List of its obligations under the Merger Agreement in all material respects not to be satisfied; and 

• in either of the cases described in the preceding two bullet points, within nine months of such termination, Angie's
List or any of its subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with a third party with respect to, or consummates a
transaction that is, a Company Takeover Proposal with a third party (or a third party otherwise consummates a
transaction that is a Company Takeover Proposal).

        In no event will IAC be entitled to more than one payment of the termination fee. If Angie's List fails to pay the termination fee if and
when it becomes due under the Merger Agreement in a timely manner and, in order to obtain such payment, IAC commences a suit that
results in an award against Angie's List for such amount, then Angie's List must reimburse IAC for all costs and expenses

amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made.

Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction

        The Merger Agreement and all claims, disputes or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to the Merger
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of the Merger Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or any rule that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than Delaware.

        In addition, each of the parties to the Merger Agreement has irrevocably agreed that any legal action or proceeding with respect to the
Merger Agreement and the rights and obligations arising thereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of the
Merger Agreement and the rights and obligations arising thereunder brought by any other party thereto, must be brought and determined
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of
Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within Delaware).

Specific Performance

        In addition to any other remedy under applicable law that may be available to such party to the Merger Agreement, including
monetary damages, each of the parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the Merger Agreement and to
enforce specifically its terms and provisions.

Amendments and Waivers

        Subject to the procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement, any provision of the Merger Agreement may be amended by the parties
to the Merger Agreement or waived by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision at any time prior to the Effective Time. However,
after the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Angie's List stockholders there may not be, without further approval of Angie's List
stockholders, any amendment or waiver of any provision of the Merger Agreement for which applicable law or applicable NASDAQ
Rules require further approval by Angie's List stockholders.

        The Merger Agreement was amended by the parties on August 26, 2017 to implement certain ministerial changes to certain timing
mechanics related to the Closing. These amendments are reflected in the Merger Agreement attached as Annex B to this proxy
statement/prospectus and such amendment (referred to as Amendment No. 1 to the Agreement and Plan of Merger) is filed as an exhibit to
the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part and is incorporated herein by reference.

claims, transactions or occurrences occurring prior to the completion of the Transactions, including in connection with the Transactions.

        In addition, the Contribution Agreement sets forth a dispute resolution mechanism and will also govern other matters related to the
provision and retention of records, access to information and property, confidentiality, cooperation in the preparation of ANGI
Homeservices' financial statements, licensing of certain intellectual property and cooperation with respect to governmental filings and
third-party consents necessary to complete the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement.

Investor Rights Agreement

        At or prior to the Closing, ANGI Homeservices and IAC will enter into the Investor Rights Agreement, the form of which is an
exhibit to the Merger Agreement. The Investor Rights Agreement will set forth certain registration, preemptive and governance rights of
IAC with respect to ANGI Homeservices, as well as certain governance rights for the benefit of ANGI Homeservices stockholders other

        Registration Rights.    IAC will be entitled to request registrations of its shares of ANGI Homeservices common stock under the

Homeservices at any time intends to file on its behalf or on behalf of any of its other securityholders a registration statement in connection
with a public offering of any of its securities on a form and in a manner that would permit the registration for offer and sale of ANGI
Homeservices common stock held by IAC, IAC will have the right to include its shares of ANGI Homeservices common stock in that
offering. After the Effective Time, ANGI Homeservices will be required to use its reasonable best efforts to qualify to register the sale of
ANGI Homeservices securities on Form S-3 and, after ANGI Homeservices is so qualified, IAC may request that ANGI Homeservices
facilitate the registration of IAC's ANGI Homeservices shares under the Securities Act on Form S-3, subject to certain limitations. After
the Form S-3 becomes effective and as long as it remains effective, IAC will be permitted to effect an unlimited number of non-
underwritten offerings or shelf take-downs (which may be underwritten offerings) using Form S-3 without notice to or inclusion of any
other securities held by ANGI Homeservices or any other persons or entities.

        In connection with a distribution of all or any portion of the shares of ANGI Homeservices common stock held by IAC to IAC's
stockholders, IAC will be entitled to registration rights with respect to such shares with any applicable federal or state governmental
authority, and ANGI Homeservices will be obligated to register such shares as requested by IAC and to list any Class A Shares required to
be delivered upon any conversion, exchange or transfer of such shares on each national securities exchange on which the ANGI
Homeservices Class A common stock is listed at the time of such distribution.

        ANGI Homeservices will generally be responsible for the registration expenses in connection with the performance of its obligations
under the registration rights provisions in the Investor Rights Agreement, with the exception of underwriting discounts, commissions and
transfer taxes, which will be borne by IAC with respect to any shares held by IAC that are registered and sold.

        The Investor Rights Agreement will contain indemnification and contribution provisions by ANGI Homeservices for the benefit of
IAC and its affiliates and representatives and by IAC for the benefit of ANGI Homeservices and its affiliates and representatives, in each
case, with respect to written information furnished to and stated by the other party to be specifically included in any registration statement,
prospectus or related document or any violation by the other party of the Securities Act or any similar federal or state securities law, rule or
regulation in connection with the registration of any securities under the Investor Rights Agreement. Except in the case of intentional
misrepresentation by IAC or by its affiliates or representatives, IAC's indemnification obligations under the Investor Rights Agreement are
capped at the net proceeds that IAC receives from the sale of securities that give rise to the applicable indemnification obligations.

        Anti-Dilution Rights.    If, after the Effective Time, ANGI Homeservices issues or proposes to issue any shares of capital stock (with
certain limited exceptions), including shares issued upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of options, warrants and convertible
securities, IAC will generally have a purchase right that permits it to purchase for cash at a price per share equal to the issue price, as
defined in the Investor Rights Agreement, the following:

• with respect to an issuance of voting stock of ANGI Homeservices, up to a number of shares of the class of ANGI
Homeservices voting stock issued in the issuance and one or more other classes of voting stock of ANGI Homeservices
then authorized as is necessary for IAC to maintain a voting interest and equity interest in ANGI Homeservices equal to
IAC's voting interest and equity interest immediately prior to such issuance or proposed issuance (and if such maintenance
is not possible, IAC has the ability to determine the mix of then authorized shares it will receive in its sole discretion,
provided that the issuance may not result in IAC exceeding its pre-issuance equity interest or voting interest); or 

• with respect to an issuance of non-voting stock of ANGI Homeservices, up to a number of shares of such class or classes of
non-voting stock of ANGI Homeservices that would enable IAC to maintain the same equity interest in ANGI
Homeservices as it had immediately prior to such issuance or proposed issuance and at least 80.1% ownership of the issued
and outstanding shares of each class of ANGI Homeservices non-voting stock.

        Board Matters.    At the Effective Time, the board of directors of ANGI Homeservices will consist of ten directors, with six directors
designated by IAC, two directors designated by IAC who qualify as "independent" pursuant to NASDAQ Rules and the Exchange Act,
and two ANGI-Designated Directors, which refer to the directors selected by Angie's List from the Angie's List board of directors, who
will be Angie R. Hicks Bowman and Thomas R. Evans, if they continue to be willing and able to serve. IAC will retain the right to
nominate a certain number of ANGI Homeservices directors corresponding to its degree of equity and voting interest in ANGI
Homeservices until such time as its equity and voting interest are both less than 10%, and to appoint replacements of its designated
directors should such individuals become unable or unwilling to serve.

        Until and excluding the ANGI Homeservices annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2020, the two ANGI-Designated Directors,
including any successor(s) to the initial ANGI-Designated Directors, will, if able and willing, continue to serve on the board of directors of
ANGI Homeservices. IAC will agree to vote its shares of ANGI Homeservices common stock in favor of the ANGI-Designated Directors
at any meeting at which any of them stand for election and will further agree not to vote to remove any ANGI-Designated Director, other
than for cause. If, prior to the annual meeting of ANGI Homeservices stockholders in 2020, any ANGI-Designated Director becomes
unwilling or unable to serve, the ANGI Homeservices board of directors will select a replacement. Any individual selected as a
replacement must be (i) "independent" pursuant to NASDAQ Rules and the Exchange Act, if the director to be replaced was also
"independent," (ii) qualified to serve as an "independent" director of IAC (were such individual to be appointed) and (iii) acceptable to the
remaining ANGI-Designated Director then serving on the ANGI Homeservices board of directors. Until the annual meeting of ANGI
Homeservices stockholders to be held in 2020, either Ms. Hicks Bowman or Mr. Evans (or her or his replacement, if applicable), may
serve on the ANGI Homeservices audit committee if such individual qualifies as "independent" pursuant to NASDAQ Rules and the
Exchange Act.

        Other Protective Provisions.    The Investor Rights Agreement contains the following agreements for the benefit of ANGI
Homeservices stockholders (other than IAC) until and excluding the annual meeting of ANGI Homeservices stockholders to be held in
2020:

• IAC will not effect any squeeze out transaction under Section 253 of the DGCL without obtaining the prior approval of a
committee of independent ANGI Homeservices directors, at least 50% of which must be the ANGI-Designated Directors, if
such persons are independent. 

• IAC will agree not to vote in favor of any amendments to the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of ANGI Homeservices
that would be inconsistent with certain provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement other than as may be approved by the
audit committee of the ANGI Homeservices board of directors or by the majority of the holders of ANGI Homeservices
Class A common stock, as applicable. 

• If IAC desires to sell or transfer 20% or more of its equity interest in ANGI Homeservices to an affiliate or an unaffiliated
third party or IAC determines to distribute its equity interest in ANGI Homeservices to IAC stockholders and such
distribution would result in a person holding a 20% or greater interest in ANGI Homeservices, IAC agrees that as a
condition to such sale, transfer or distribution such affiliate or third party will agree to assume IAC's obligations under the
Investor Rights Agreement (unless such transaction would result in the affiliate or third party owning 100% of the
outstanding capital stock of ANGI Homeservices). 

• Certain provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement may not be amended or waived without the prior consent of a majority
of the holders of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock.

Employee Matters Agreement

        At or prior to the Closing, ANGI Homeservices and IAC will enter into the Employee Matters Agreement, the form of which is an
exhibit to the Merger Agreement. The Employee Matters Agreement will address certain compensation and benefits issues following the
Closing. Under the Employee Matters Agreement:

• IAC will assume or retain: (i) all liabilities with respect to IAC employees, former IAC employees, and their respective
dependents and beneficiaries under all IAC employee benefit plans, and (ii) all liabilities with respect to the employment or
termination of employment of all IAC employees and former IAC employees (other than the employees and former
employees of the HomeAdvisor Business or Angie's List); and

Table of Contents

• ANGI Homeservices will assume or retain: (i) all liabilities under Angie's List and HomeAdvisor employee benefit plans,
and (ii) all liabilities with respect to the employment or termination of employment of employees and former employees of
Angie's List or the HomeAdvisor Business.

        Following the Closing, ANGI Homeservices will participate in IAC's U.S. health and welfare plans, 401(k) plan, and flexible benefits
plan and will reimburse IAC for the costs of such participation. In the event that IAC no longer retains shares representing at least 80% of
the aggregate voting power of shares entitled to vote in the election of the ANGI Homeservices board of directors, including in the event
of a future spin-off of IAC's interest in ANGI Homeservices to IAC stockholders, the Employee Matters Agreement provides that ANGI
Homeservices will cease to participate in IAC's employee benefit plans and will establish its own employee benefit plans that will be
substantially similar to the plans sponsored by IAC prior to the spin-off.

        Pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement, outstanding HomeAdvisor stock appreciation rights will be converted into stock
appreciation rights in respect of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices in connection with the Contribution. The number of shares subject
to the award and the exercise price of the award will be adjusted to preserve the aggregate intrinsic value of the original HomeAdvisor
award, as measured immediately before and immediately after the Contribution, subject to rounding.

        The Employee Matters Agreement also will provide that ANGI Homeservices will reimburse IAC for the cost of any IAC equity
awards held by ANGI Homeservices employees and former employees; IAC may elect to receive payment either in cash or in Class B
shares of ANGI Homeservices. The Employee Matters Agreement will further provide that, with respect to equity awards in certain
subsidiaries of ANGI Homeservices, IAC may elect to cause those awards to be settled in either shares of IAC common stock or in
Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices; to the extent shares of IAC common stock are issued in settlement, ANGI Homeservices will
reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing to IAC additional Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices.

        Under the Employee Matters Agreement, the compensation committee of the IAC board of directors will have the exclusive authority
to determine the treatment of outstanding IAC equity awards in the event of a subsequent spin-off of IAC's retained interest in ANGI
Homeservices to IAC stockholders and ANGI Homeservices will agree to assume any IAC equity awards that are converted into ANGI
Homeservices equity awards in connection with any such spin-off.

Intercompany Note

        At or prior to the Closing, ANGI Homeservices and IAC or a subsidiary of IAC will enter into one or more intercompany loan
agreements (collectively referred to as the "Intercompany Note"), the form of which is an exhibit to the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the
Intercompany Note, IAC or a subsidiary of IAC will provide the funds necessary at the Effective Time to repay the outstanding balance
under Angie's List's existing credit agreement. ANGI Homeservices and its subsidiaries may also request further advances under the
Intercompany Note or under additional agreements substantially in the form of the Intercompany Note following the Closing to cover
general corporate purposes such as the provision of working capital, which IAC in its discretion may agree to provide on the terms set
forth in the Intercompany Note.

        Amounts owing under the Intercompany Note may be advanced in dollars, or if agreed to by the parties, in foreign currencies. Any
such amounts will bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 3.25% per annum, or in the case of amounts denominated in a foreign
currency, the applicable foreign benchmark rate plus 3.25% per annum. If the Intercompany Note is not paid when due, default interest at a
rate of 2% per annum will also accrue.

        Amounts owing under the Intercompany Note may be voluntarily prepaid at par at any time, without premium or penalty. Amounts
owing under the Intercompany Note will be mandatorily

prepayable, without premium or penalty, upon a change of control. If ANGI Homeservices or any of its subsidiaries incurs more than
$25 million of debt for borrowed money, the net cash proceeds of such indebtedness must be used to prepay amounts owing under the
Intercompany Note.

Services Agreement

        At or prior to the Closing, ANGI Homeservices and IAC will enter into the Services Agreement, the form of which is an exhibit to the
Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, IAC will provide certain of the services that it has historically provided to the
HomeAdvisor Business to ANGI Homeservices following the Closing. The Services Agreement will also allow both ANGI Homeservices
and IAC to continue to receive services under certain shared contracts.

        Types of Services to Be Provided by IAC.    ANGI Homeservices currently expects that IAC will provide a combination of the
following services, among others, pursuant to the Services Agreement following the Closing:

• assistance with certain legal, M&A, human resources, finance, risk management, internal audit and treasury functions,
health and wellness, information security services, and insurance and tax affairs, including assistance with certain public
company and unclaimed property reporting obligations; 

• accounting, controllership and payroll processing services; 

• investor relations services; 

• tax compliance services; and 

• such other services as to which IAC and ANGI Homeservices may agree.

        Cost of Services Provided by IAC.    The costs charged to ANGI Homeservices will generally be determined based on the actual cost
to IAC. These costs will be subject to increase following the Closing upon increases in the actual cost to IAC.

        Manner of Providing Services.    Unless the parties otherwise agree with respect to a particular service, (i) each applicable service
provider will be required to perform services under the Service Agreement in a manner, scope, nature and quality as provided by or within
IAC that is similar in all material respects to the manner in which such services were performed in the 12 months immediately prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) the services may only be used for substantially the same purposes and in substantially the same manner as the
services were used immediately prior to the Closing Date.

        Requests for Additional Services.    From time to time during the term applicable to any service being provided by a service provider,
each of IAC and ANGI Homeservices may request that the other party (i) provide additional or different services that the other party is not
expressly obligated to provide under the Services Agreement, if those services are of the type and scope provided by such providing party
within IAC, or (ii) expand the scope of any service. The party receiving such request must consider such request in good faith and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the requested additional service. However, neither party will be obligated to provide any
additional services if it does not, in its reasonable judgment, have adequate resources to provide such additional services or if the provision
of such additional services would interfere with the operation of its business.

        Term for Services Provided.    In general, the services to be provided under the Services Agreement will begin at the Effective Time
and will continue for an initial term of one year. This initial one-year term will automatically renew for additional one-year periods
thereafter for so long as IAC continues to own a majority of the outstanding shares of ANGI Homeservices common stock, unless all
services under the Services Agreement have been otherwise terminated. The party receiving a service under the Services Agreement may
terminate the agreement with respect to one or more particular services, or

may reduce the scope of any particular service, at any time, subject to a specified notice period. The party providing a service may
terminate the agreement with respect to one or more particular services, or may reduce the scope of any particular service, at any time after
the first anniversary of the Closing Date, subject to a notice period.

Tax Sharing Agreement

        At or prior to the Closing, ANGI Homeservices and IAC will enter into the Tax Sharing Agreement, the form of which is an exhibit to
the Merger Agreement. The Tax Sharing Agreement will govern the parties' respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect
to tax matters, including responsibility for taxes attributable to ANGI Homeservices and its subsidiaries, entitlement to refunds, allocation
of tax attributes, preparation of tax returns, certain tax elections, control of tax contests and other matters.

        Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, ANGI Homeservices generally will be responsible and will be required to indemnify IAC for:

• all taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of IAC or its subsidiaries that includes
ANGI Homeservices or any of its subsidiaries to the extent attributable to ANGI Homeservices or any of its subsidiaries
(including certain taxes attributable to the HomeAdvisor Entities for taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on or
before the Effective Time), as determined under the Tax Sharing Agreement, and 

• all taxes imposed with respect to any of ANGI Homeservices' or its subsidiaries' consolidated, combined, unitary or
separate tax returns.

        Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, IAC generally will have the right to control audits or other tax proceedings with respect to any
consolidated, combined or unitary tax return that includes IAC or any of its subsidiaries and ANGI Homeservices or any of its
subsidiaries, provided that ANGI Homeservices will have certain information and participation rights with respect to any such audit or tax
proceeding that could reasonably be expected to result in additional taxes above certain thresholds for which it is liable under the Tax
Sharing Agreement. ANGI Homeservices generally will have the right to control any audits or other tax proceedings with respect to any
tax returns that solely include ANGI Homeservices and its subsidiaries.

        As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, IAC has advised ANGI Homeservices that it does not have a present plan or
intention to undertake a tax-free spin-off of its interest in ANGI Homeservices. Because IAC intends to retain the ability to engage in such
a tax-free spin-off in the future, the Tax Sharing Agreement also addresses the parties' respective rights, responsibilities and obligations
with respect to such a transaction. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, each party generally will be responsible for any taxes and related
amounts imposed on IAC or ANGI Homeservices (or their respective subsidiaries) that arise from the failure of a future spin-off of IAC's
retained interest in ANGI Homeservices to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under
Section 368(a)(1)(D) and/or Section 355 of the Code, to the extent that the failure to so qualify is attributable to (i) a breach of the relevant
representations and covenants made by that party in the Tax Sharing Agreement or any representation letter provided in support of any tax
opinion or ruling obtained by IAC with respect to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of such spin-off, (ii) an acquisition of such party's
equity securities (or certain arrangements or substantial negotiations or discussions with respect to certain such acquisitions), or (iii) solely
with respect to ANGI Homeservices, any other action or failure to act by ANGI Homeservices after any such spin-off.

        ANGI Homeservices and its subsidiaries generally will be required to take any action reasonably requested by IAC to consummate a
tax-free spin-off of IAC's interest in ANGI Homeservices and will not take or fail to take any action that could reasonably be expected to
prevent such a spin-off.

Table of Contents

        In addition, the Tax Sharing Agreement will impose certain restrictions on ANGI Homeservices and its subsidiaries during the two-
year period following any future spin-off that are designed to preserve the tax-free status thereof. Specifically, during such period, except
in specific circumstances, ANGI Homeservices and its subsidiaries generally would be prohibited from: (i) entering into any transaction
pursuant to which ANGI Homeservices stock would be acquired above a certain threshold, (ii) merging, consolidating or liquidating,
(iii) selling or transferring assets above certain thresholds, (iv) redeeming or repurchasing stock (with certain exceptions), (v) altering the
voting rights of ANGI Homeservices stock, (vi) taking or failing to take other actions inconsistent with representations or covenants in any
tax opinion or private letter ruling documents or (vii) ceasing to engage in any active trade or business as defined in the Code.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER 

        To the extent this section constitutes statements as to matters of U.S. federal income tax law, this section constitutes the opinion of
Sidley Austin LLP.

        The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders (as defined
below) of Angie's List common stock whose shares are exchanged for ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock and/or cash pursuant to
the Merger. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), applicable U.S.
Treasury regulations, judicial opinions, and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, each as in
effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any
such change or interpretation could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion does
not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax consequences. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising
under the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 or the
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and agreements entered into in
connection therewith), nor does it address any tax consequences arising under state, local or foreign laws or U.S. federal laws other than
those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax.

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of Angie's List common stock that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes:

• a citizen or individual resident of the United States; 

• a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under
the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; 

• a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one
or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) the trust has a valid election in
effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or 

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "non-U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of Angie's List common stock that is not a U.S.
holder (other than an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes).

        This discussion is limited to U.S. holders of shares of Angie's List common stock who hold such shares as a "capital asset" within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not purport to consider all
aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in light of its particular circumstances, or that may apply to
U.S. holders that are subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, insurance companies,
dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies, traders in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, holders
subject to the alternative minimum tax, holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations,
governmental agencies or instrumentalities, tax-qualified retirement plans, banks and certain other financial institutions, mutual funds,
certain expatriates, partnerships (or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes),
S corporations or other pass-through entities or investors in partnerships, S corporations or other pass-through entities, real estate
investment trusts, regulated investment companies, holders who hold shares of Angie's List common stock as part of a hedge, straddle,
constructive sale, conversion transaction or other integrated

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1491778/000104746917005453/a2233101zdefm14a.htm 170/344

transaction, holders that own (actually or constructively) 5% or more of the outstanding Angie's List common stock or that own (actually
or constructively) both IAC common stock and Angie's List common stock, holders who acquired their shares of Angie's List common
stock through the exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements, and non-U.S. holders (except to the extent
specifically discussed below)).

        If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
holds shares of Angie's List common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the
partners and the activities of the partnership. If you are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a partner of a partnership holding shares of
Angie's List common stock, you should consult your tax advisor.

        All holders of Angie's List common stock should consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences to
them of the Merger, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax, the unearned income Medicare contribution
tax and any other U.S. federal, state, local, foreign or other tax laws. Non-U.S. holders of Angie's List common stock should consult
their own tax advisors regarding the possibility that, in the event the applicable withholding agent is unable to determine whether any
Cash Consideration paid in the Merger should be treated as a dividend for applicable U.S. federal income tax purposes, such
withholding agent may withhold at a rate of 30% (or a lower applicable treaty rate) on the payment of the Cash Consideration to such
non-U.S. holders, and such non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the possible desirability and timing of selling
any shares of IAC common stock or Angie's List common stock they own.

        It is a condition to the obligation of Angie's List to effect the Merger that Angie's List receive a written opinion from its counsel,
Sidley Austin, to the effect that either (i) the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or
(ii) the Merger, when combined with the Contribution and the IAC Share Issuance, will qualify as an exchange described in Section 351(a)
of the Code. This condition to the Closing may be waived by Angie's List in its sole discretion, although Angie's List does not have any
intention to waive this condition, and in any event would not waive this condition without first resoliciting the approval of its stockholders.
This opinion will be based on facts, representations, assumptions and covenants set forth or referred to therein. If any of such
representations or covenants is or becomes incorrect or is violated, the validity of the opinion may be affected and the U.S. federal income
tax consequences of the Merger could differ materially from those described below. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any
court. Angie's List has not sought and does not intend to seek any ruling from the IRS with respect to the Merger. Angie's List does not
intend to and will not waive this condition without recirculating this document in order to resolicit Angie's List stockholder approval.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders

        Assuming the receipt and accuracy of the opinion described above and subject to the discussion below under the headings "Blocks of
Angie's List Common Stock Acquired at Different Times or Different Prices" and "Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares," the material U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the Merger to U.S. holders of Angie's List common stock generally are as follows:

        U.S. Holders That Receive Solely ANGI Homeservices Class A Common Stock.    A U.S. holder of Angie's List common stock that
exchanges such common stock solely for ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock in the Merger generally will not recognize gain or
loss upon receipt of such ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock, except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares of
ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock (as discussed below). The aggregate tax basis of the shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A
common stock received (including any fractional shares deemed received and exchanged for cash) generally will be equal to the adjusted
tax basis in the Angie's List common stock exchanged. The holding period of the shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A common

Table of Contents

stock received (including any fractional shares deemed received and exchanged for cash) will include the holding period of the shares of
Angie's List common stock exchanged therefor.

        U.S. Holders That Receive Solely Cash.    A U.S. holder of Angie's List common stock that exchanges such common stock solely for
cash generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of cash received and the
U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in the Angie's List common stock exchanged. Such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital
gain or loss if the holding period for the Angie's List common stock exchanged is greater than one year as of the Closing Date. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

        U.S. Holders That Receive a Combination of ANGI Homeservices Class A Common Stock and Cash.    A U.S. holder of Angie's List
common stock that exchanges such common stock for a combination of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock and cash (other than
cash received in lieu of fractional shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock) generally will recognize gain (but not loss) in an
amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount by which the sum of the fair market value of the ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock
and cash received by such holder exceeds such holder's adjusted tax basis in its shares of Angie's List common stock surrendered, and
(ii) the amount of cash received (in each case, excluding any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A
common stock). Any recognized gain generally will be long-term capital gain if, as of Closing Date, the U.S. holder's holding period for
the Angie's List common stock exchanged is greater than one year. The tax basis of the ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock
received (including any fractional shares deemed received and exchanged for cash) by a U.S. holder that exchanges Angie's List common
stock for a combination of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock and cash will be equal to the adjusted tax basis of the Angie's List
common stock exchanged, reduced by the amount of cash received by the holder (excluding any cash received in lieu of fractional shares
of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock) and increased by the amount of gain, if any, recognized by the holder (excluding any gain
recognized with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock) in the Merger with
respect to such Angie's List common stock. The holding period of the ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock received (including any
fractional shares deemed received and exchanged for cash) will include the holding period of the Angie's List common stock exchanged.

        Blocks of Angie's List Common Stock Acquired at Different Times or Different Prices.    If a U.S. holder of Angie's List common stock
acquired different blocks of stock at different times or different prices, certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to such
holder may depend on whether the Merger qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or whether the
Merger, combined with the Contribution and the IAC Share Issuance, qualifies as an exchange described in Section 351(a) of the Code.
Specifically, in the event the Merger qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, such holders may be
able to designate how shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock and cash, if any, are allocated among the different blocks of
shares of Angie's List common stock exchanged for purposes of determining the amount of gain recognized as well as the tax basis and
holding period of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock received in the Merger. Whether the Merger qualifies as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code will depend, among other facts, on the relative fair market values at the Closing of the
aggregate Cash Consideration, if any, and the aggregate Share Consideration into which shares of Angie's List common stock are
converted pursuant to the Merger and, accordingly, will not be known prior to the Closing. It is anticipated that information regarding the
qualification of the Merger as a "reorganization" or as part of an overall exchange described in Section 351(a) of the Code will be made
available on IRS Form 8937 following the Closing. U.S. holders that acquired different blocks of Angie's List common stock at different
times or different prices should consult their own tax advisors regarding the manner in which gain, loss, tax basis and holding periods
should be determined.

Table of Contents

        Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares.    A U.S. holder of Angie's List common stock who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of
ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock in the Merger generally will be treated as having received such fractional share in the Merger,
and then as having sold such fractional share for cash. Gain or loss generally will be recognized by such holder based on the difference
between the amount of cash received in lieu of the fractional share and the tax basis allocated to such fractional share of ANGI
Homeservices Class A common stock.

        Information Reporting and Backup Withholding.    Payments of cash made to a U.S. holder of Angie's List common stock in
connection with the Merger will be subject to information reporting and may be subject to "backup withholding" (currently at a rate of
28%) unless such holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or furnishes its taxpayer identification number, and otherwise timely
complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are
not additional taxes and may be allowed as a refund or credit against the holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required
information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

SELECTED HISTORICAL COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF
THE HOMEADVISOR BUSINESS 

        The following tables present selected historical combined financial information for the HomeAdvisor Business. This information has
been derived, in part, from the historical combined financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business included elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus and reflects the operations and financial position of the HomeAdvisor Business at the dates and for the periods
indicated. The unaudited combined interim financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business have been prepared on the same basis as the
audited combined financial statements and, in the opinion of management of the HomeAdvisor Business, reflect all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of this information. These historical results are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for any future period, and results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results
to be expected for the full year.

        The historical combined financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business have been prepared on a standalone basis and are derived
from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of IAC. The combined financial statements reflect the historical
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the businesses comprising the HomeAdvisor Business since their respective
dates of acquisition by IAC and the allocation to the HomeAdvisor Business of certain IAC corporate expenses relating to the
HomeAdvisor Business based on the historical financial statements and accounting records of IAC. In the opinion of management of the
HomeAdvisor Business, the assumptions underlying the historical combined financial statements, including the basis on which expenses
have been allocated from IAC, are reasonable. However, the allocations may not reflect the expenses that the HomeAdvisor Business may
have incurred as an independent, standalone company (or as part of ANGI Homeservices) for the periods presented. The historical
combined financial statements may not reflect what the actual financial position, results of operation and cash flows of the HomeAdvisor
Business would have been if the HomeAdvisor Business had been an independent, standalone company (or part of ANGI Homeservices)
for the periods presented. For the purposes of the combined financial statements, income taxes have been computed as if the entities
comprising the HomeAdvisor Business filed on a standalone, separate tax return basis.

        The information presented below is only a summary and should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in
this proxy statement/prospectus, and in particular the sections entitled "Information About the HomeAdvisor Business," "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the HomeAdvisor Business" and the audited and unaudited
combined financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business, including the notes thereto,

(2) In considering the financial performance of the HomeAdvisor Business, management and the chief operating
decision maker analyze the primary financial performance measure of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is
defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-
related items consisting of amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if
applicable.

Management of the HomeAdvisor Business believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful for analysts and investors as this
measure allows a more meaningful comparison between the performance of the HomeAdvisor Business and that of
its competitors. Moreover, management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of the
HomeAdvisor Business as a whole and its individual business segments, and this measure is one of the primary
metrics on which internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. The above items are
excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because these items are non-cash in nature, and management believes that by
excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from the
HomeAdvisor Business, from which capital investments are made and long-term related party debt is serviced. 

Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. It is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial condition or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative
to operating income or net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily
comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, you should not consider Adjusted
EBITDA in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, the results of operations of the HomeAdvisor Business as
determined in accordance with GAAP. See the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations of the HomeAdvisor Business—HomeAdvisor's Principles of Financial
Reporting." 

The following table reconciles operating income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
ANGI HOMESERVICES INC.

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based upon the historical financial statements of the
HomeAdvisor Business, which are included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, as adjusted to include the pro forma impact of
the recent acquisitions of controlling interests in MyHammer, HomeStars and MyBuilder, and the historical financial statements of Angie's
List, which are incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance
sheet as of June 30, 2017 is presented as if the Transactions were completed on June 30, 2017. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016 are presented as if the
Transactions were completed on January 1, 2016.

        The pro forma adjustments give effect to the following:

• the settlement of $99.8 million of existing related party debt between certain of HomeAdvisor's international subsidiaries
and certain IAC international subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time by: (1) the payment of $28.0 million by
HomeAdvisor's international subsidiaries from cash on hand to IAC's international subsidiaries, (2) the contribution of
$67.4 million by IAC to HomeAdvisor's international subsidiaries and the subsequent payment to IAC's international
subsidiaries of the $67.4 million, and (3) the distribution of an intercompany note of €4.0 million, or $4.4 million, by a
HomeAdvisor international subsidiary to an IAC international subsidiary; 

• the issuance of an Intercompany Note between IAC and ANGI Homeservices immediately prior to the Effective Time,
pursuant to which, IAC or a subsidiary of IAC will provide the funds necessary to repay the outstanding balance under
Angie's List's existing Term Loan, which is $60.0 million as of June 30, 2017; 

• the contribution of the HomeAdvisor Business by IAC to ANGI Homeservices for 414.3 million Class B shares, which
together with Class A shares underlying equity awards in respect of HomeAdvisor (US) to be converted into awards of
ANGI Homeservices, will represent 87% to 90% of the economic interest (on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the
treasury stock method) and approximately 98% of the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices common stock. IAC's
ownership percentage will be dependent upon the number of Angie's List stockholders electing to receive cash
consideration. Angie's List stockholders can elect cash consideration of $8.50 per share up to a cap of $130.0 million. For
purposes of the unaudited pro forma combined financial information, it is assumed that no Angie's List stockholders will
elect to receive the cash consideration, therefore, IAC, together with Class A shares underlying equity awards in respect of
HomeAdvisor (US) to be converted into awards in respect of ANGI Homeservices, will own 87% of the economic interest
of ANGI Homeservices; (on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury stock method); and 

• the consummation of the Merger as described under the section "The Transactions" and more fully in the Merger
Agreement (assuming for the purposes of calculating the number of Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices to be issued to
IAC pursuant to the Merger Agreement, an ANGI Unaffected Price of $11.80, which for simplicity was the closing price of
Angie's List common stock on the NASDAQ on August 17, 2017).

        Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the HomeAdvisor Business will be contributed to ANGI Homeservices on a net cash free,
debt free basis exclusive of any cash required to fund the Cash Consideration. As the contribution represents a transaction between entities
under common control, the HomeAdvisor Business's assets and liabilities will be transferred at their historical carrying values.

        ANGI Homeservices will account for the acquisition of Angie's List pursuant to the Merger using the acquisition method of
accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). ANGI Homeservices will measure
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values, including net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, as of the
Closing. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill.

        The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements is based on preliminary estimates using assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The
determination of the final purchase price and fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be completed following the
Closing. The final purchase price and allocation may be different from that reflected in the pro forma purchase price allocation presented
herein, and the differences may be material.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and pro forma adjustments, which are described in the
accompanying notes, should be read in conjunction with the unaudited and audited combined financial statements of the HomeAdvisor
Business, which are included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, and the unaudited and audited consolidated financial
statements of Angie's List, which are incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus. The pro forma adjustments give effect
to events that are (1) directly attributable to the Transactions, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with respect to the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statement of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results of ANGI Homeservices
following the Transactions. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been presented for illustrative
purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the operating results and financial position that would have been achieved had the
Transactions occurred on the dates indicated. Further, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not purport to
project the future financial position or results of operations of ANGI Homeservices following the Merger.

        ANGI Homeservices currently intends to enter into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as
administrative agent and certain lenders after the Closing. The Credit Agreement is expected to provide for a five-year term loan A facility
not to exceed $275 million, and to be guaranteed by ANGI Homeservice's wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries. It is expected to
be secured by substantially all assets of ANGI Homeservices and the guarantors, subject to certain exceptions to be agreed. The proceeds
of the Credit Agreement, if any, are expected to be used to repay indebtedness outstanding to IAC and its subsidiaries, to pay fees and
expenses in connection with the Merger and for general corporate purposes, including working capital and dividends. The Credit
Agreement is expected to have affirmative, negative and financial covenants to be agreed among the lenders and ANGI Homeservices.
While ANGI Homeservices currently intends to enter into the Credit Agreement, it may determine not to do so. In addition, the
Transactions are not contingent upon ANGI Homeservices entering into the Credit Agreement. Therefore, the Credit Agreement is not
included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and pro forma adjustments.

ANGI HOMESERVICES INC.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

Note 1. Description of Transaction

        On May 1, 2017, Angie's List and IAC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to combine IAC's HomeAdvisor Business and
Angie's List under a new publicly traded company to be called ANGI Homeservices. The Merger Agreement provides for the acquisition
of Angie's List by ANGI Homeservices by way of the merger of Casa Merger Sub, a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of ANGI
Homeservices, with and into Angie's List, with Angie's List continuing as the surviving company in the Merger and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of ANGI Homeservices. The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement
and the Contribution Agreement, prior to the Closing, IAC will contribute its HomeAdvisor Business, along with cash sufficient to fund
the aggregate Cash Consideration (defined below), if any, to ANGI Homeservices in exchange for 414.3 million Class B shares which
together with Class A shares underlying equity awards in respect of HomeAdvisor (US) to be converted into awards of ANGI
Homeservices will represent 87% to 90% of the economic interest (on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury stock method)
and approximately 98% of the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices common stock. IAC's ownership percentage will be dependent
upon the number of Angie's List stockholders electing to receive cash. Angie's List stockholders can elect cash consideration of $8.50 per
share up to a cap of $130.0 million.

        At the Effective Time of the Merger, each share of Angie's List common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares owned or held in treasury by Angie's List, which will automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist for no
consideration) will be converted into the right to receive, at the holder's election (i) in the case of a share of Angie's List common stock
with respect to which an election to receive a Class A share of ANGI Homeservices has been properly made, one Class A share of ANGI
Homeservices (the "Share Consideration") or (ii) in the case of a share of Angie's List common stock with respect to which an election to
receive cash has been properly made, $8.50 in cash, without interest (the "Cash Consideration") subject to proration. Elections to receive
the Cash Consideration by Angie's List stockholders will be subject to the proration procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement, such
that Angie's List stockholders will receive, in the aggregate, no more than $130.0 million in cash. For further details regarding the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement and the effects of the Merger, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement." Each option to
purchase shares of Angie's List common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, as of the Effective Time, be
converted into an option to purchase (i) that number of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices equal to the total number of shares of
Angie's List common stock subject to such Angie's List option immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) at a per-share exercise price
equal to the exercise price per share of Angie's List common stock at which such Angie's List option was exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Each award of restricted stock units that corresponds to shares of Angie's List common stock that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will, as of the Effective Time, be converted into an ANGI Homeservices restricted stock unit
award with respect to a number of Class A shares equal to the number of shares of Angie's List common stock subject to such restricted
stock unit award immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming satisfaction of any applicable performance goals at the target
performance level with respect to Angie's List performance-based restricted stock unit awards granted in June 2016). Each ANGI
Homeservices restricted stock unit award will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as applied to the
corresponding Angie's List restricted stock unit award immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that ANGI Homeservices restricted
stock unit awards corresponding to performance-based Angie's List restricted stock unit awards granted in June 2016 will vest solely on
the basis of service following the Effective Time.

Note 2. HomeAdvisor Business Financing Pro Forma Adjustments

        Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the HomeAdvisor Business will be contributed to ANGI Homeservices on a net cash free,
debt free basis exclusive of any cash required to fund the Cash Consideration.

(a) To reflect the settlement of $99.8 million of existing related party debt between certain of HomeAdvisor's international subsidiaries
and certain IAC international subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time by: (1) the payment of $28.0 million by
HomeAdvisor's international subsidiaries from cash on hand to IAC's international subsidiaries, (2) the contribution of
$67.4 million in cash by IAC to HomeAdvisor's international subsidiaries and the subsequent payment to IAC's international
subsidiaries of the $67.4 million, and (3) the distribution of an intercompany note of €4.0 million, or $4.4 million, by a
HomeAdvisor international subsidiary to an IAC international subsidiary. 

(b) To eliminate the interest expense related to the debt arrangements for the HomeAdvisor Business in the amount of $4.0 million and
$7.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. 

(c) To reflect the issuance of the Intercompany Note by IAC or by a subsidiary of IAC to ANGI Homeservices immediately prior to
the Effective Time in the amount of $60.0 million. 

(d) To reflect estimated transaction costs (excluding integration planning, severance, retention and other employee related costs) of
approximately $12.3 million that are expected to be incurred by the HomeAdvisor Business. Approximately $3.6 million has been
paid and/or accrued prior to June 30, 2017. 

(e) To reflect the elimination of costs incurred by the HomeAdvisor Business related to the Merger for the six months ended June 30,
2017 as they are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. 

(f) To reflect the pro forma interest expense on the Intercompany Note in the amount of $1.3 million and $2.7 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.

        The pro forma interest expense on the Intercompany Note is calculated as follows (in thousands):

Amounts owed under the Intercompany Note will bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.25% per annum. A 125 basis
point increase or decrease in the interest rate on the Intercompany Note would increase or decrease pro forma interest expense by
$38 thousand and

Note 3. Transaction Pro Forma Adjustments

(g) To reflect the contribution of the HomeAdvisor Business to ANGI Homeservices in exchange for 414.3 million Class B shares
which together with Class A shares underlying equity awards in respect of HomeAdvisor (US) to be converted into awards of
ANGI Homeservices will represent 87% of the economic interest (on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury stock
method) and approximately 98% of the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices common stock. For purposes of the unaudited
pro forma combined financial information, it is assumed that no Angie's List stockholders will elect to receive Cash Consideration.
As the contribution represents a transaction between entities under common control, the HomeAdvisor Business's assets and
liabilities will be contributed at their historical carrying values and Class B common stock will be issued for the respective carrying
value of the contribution. 

(h) The total preliminary estimated purchase price of approximately $746.5 million was determined based on the number of shares of
Angie's List common stock and equity awards outstanding under Angie's List stock plans as of August 18, 2017, the most recent
practicable in the preparation of this proxy statement/prospectus. The stock price assumed for the total preliminary purchase price
is the closing price of Angie's List common stock on the NASDAQ on August 17, 2017 ($11.80 per share), the most recent
practicable in the preparation of this proxy statement/prospectus. It is assumed that no Angie's List stockholders will elect to
receive the Cash Consideration.

A portion of the preliminary estimated Merger consideration has been attributed to the pro rata vested portion of Angie's List stock
options and restricted stock units outstanding as of August 18, 2017, which will be converted into stock options and restricted stock
units of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock. Each option to purchase shares of Angie's List common stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, as of the Effective Time, be converted into an option to purchase (i) that
number of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices equal to the total number of shares of Angie's List common stock subject to such
Angie's List option immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) at a per-share exercise price equal to the exercise price per share of
Angie's List common stock at which such Angie's List option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each award
of restricted stock units that corresponds to shares of Angie's List common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will, as of the Effective Time, be converted into an ANGI Homeservices restricted stock unit award with respect to
a number of Class A shares equal to the number of shares of Angie's List common stock subject to such restricted stock unit award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (assuming satisfaction of any applicable performance goals at the target performance level
with respect to Angie's List performance-based restricted stock unit awards granted in June 2016). Each ANGI Homeservices
restricted stock unit award will otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as applied to the
corresponding Angie's List restricted stock unit award immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that ANGI Homeservices
restricted stock unit awards corresponding to performance-based Angie's List restricted stock unit awards granted in June 2016 will
vest solely on the basis of service following the Effective Time.

The aggregate purchase price will be based on the actual closing price per share of Angie's List common stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and could differ, and that difference could be material, from the assumed value of $11.80 per share used to
determine the total purchase price of $746.5 million, which was used to prepare these unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements. Generally, if the actual closing price per share of Angie's List common stock on the Closing Date is higher
than the assumed amount, the actual amount recorded for goodwill

would be higher; conversely, if the actual closing price is lower, the actual amount recorded for goodwill would be lower.

Preliminary Estimated Purchase Price Calculation and Allocation

The total preliminary estimated purchase price described above has been allocated to Angie's List's tangible and intangible assets
and liabilities for purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements based on their estimated relative
fair values. Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the preliminary estimate of fair value of the consideration expected to
be transferred and the preliminary estimates of fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

The total preliminary estimated purchase price was calculated and allocated as follows, based on Angie's List's June 30, 2017
balance sheet (in thousands):

The preliminary estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired consists of the following (in thousands):

Table of Contents

        The estimated deferred tax liability is calculated as follow (in thousands):

The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements is based on the preliminary estimates using assumptions that management of the HomeAdvisor Business
believes are reasonable. The determination of the final purchase price fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be
completed following the Closing. The final purchase price and allocation may be different from that reflected in the pro forma
purchase price allocation presented herein and the differences may be material. As a result, the final acquisition accounting
adjustments, could differ materially from the pro forma adjustments presented herein. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of
Angie's List's tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities as compared to the information shown herein would also
change the portion of purchase price allocable to goodwill.

(i) To record the par value related to shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock issued to former Angie's List stockholders
as Share Consideration in the Merger. 

(j) To reflect the incremental amortization associated with the preliminary valuation of the definite-lived intangible assets acquired in
connection with the acquisition of Angie's List. The assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis based upon the estimated
useful lives in the table above. 

(k) To reflect the elimination of historical depreciation expense relating to Angie's List capitalized software that was reflected as
developed technology in purchase accounting. 

(l) To reflect the increase in sales commission expense resulting from conforming Angie's List's accounting policy for sales
commission to the HomeAdvisor Business's accounting policy, which is to expense sales commission as incurred. Angie's List has
historically capitalized its sales commissions. This adjustment reflects the impact to the statement of operations for the six months
ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016. 

(m) To reflect estimated transaction costs of approximately $25.2 million that are expected to be incurred by Angie's List.
Approximately $4.6 million has been paid and/or accrued prior to June 30, 2017. 

(n) To reflect a liability for certain retention bonuses that are expected to be probable and reasonably estimable as of the Closing date
pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides for payments of up to $2 million, 50% of which is payable on
the Closing and the remaining 50% is payable 90 days following the Closing, in each case subject to continued employment
through the payment dates. Unpaid amounts with respect to such payments shall become immediately payable upon a termination
of employment without cause following the Closing. The $2 million pro forma balance sheet adjustment represents the accrual for
the entire expected payment of $2 million. 

(o) To reflect the elimination of costs incurred by Angie's List related to the Merger for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and for the
year ended December 31, 2016 as they are not expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results.

(p) To reflect the repayment of the existing debt of Angie's List, current maturity of $3.0 million and long-term portion of
$57.0 million, as well as the write-off of $1.9 million of related unamortized deferred financing costs. 

(q) To eliminate the historical interest expense related to Angie's List Term Loan in the amount of $3.0 million and $4.7 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.

The calculation of the estimated purchase price in adjustment (h) above assumes that all common shareholders of Angie's List elect to
receive the Share Consideration in exchange for their common shares of Angie's List because the closing trading price of Angie's List of
$11.80 as of August 17, 2017, which is the assumed purchase price, is in excess of the Cash Consideration of $8.50 per Angie's List
common share by $3.30. The maximum Cash Consideration is $130.0 million or 15,294,118 shares at $8.50 per share. In order to illustrate
the potential impact of the Cash Consideration being elected by certain Angie's List shareholders, we have assumed that the maximum
Cash Consideration has been elected in the tables below. In summary, the impact would be (i) a reduction in the purchase price,
shareholders' equity and goodwill of $50.5 million and (ii) a reduction of 15,294,118 in the number of ANGI Homeservices Class A shares
issued to common shareholders of Angie's List and a corresponding increase in the number of Class B shares issued to
IAC/InterActiveCorp in exchange for funding the maximum Cash Consideration of $130.0 million.

Note 5. Conversion of Employee Equity Awards Outstanding as of the Effective Time

        As a result of the Transactions, the outstanding employee equity awards as of the Effective Time of Angie's List and HomeAdvisor
(US) will be converted into awards that are exercisable for Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices. The pro forma adjustments related to
the conversion of these awards are described below.

Existing Angie's List Employee Equity Awards

        As described in adjustment (h) above, the estimated fair value of the vested portion of Angie's List stock options and restricted stock
units outstanding as of the Effective Time that will be converted into stock options and restricted stock units of ANGI Homeservices
Class A common stock is included as part of the estimated purchase price.

        The estimated fair value of Angie's List unvested stock options and restricted stock units outstanding as of the Effective Time that
will be converted into stock options and restricted stock units of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock will be amortized to expense
over the remaining vesting period of these awards.

Existing HomeAdvisor (US) Equity Awards

        Upon completion of the Transactions, the outstanding vested and unvested stock appreciation rights that are denominated in the
common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) will be converted into awards that are exercisable for Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices
immediately following the Effective Time.

        The incremental fair value arising from the conversion of the outstanding vested HomeAdvisor (US) stock appreciation rights will be
recorded as a one-time nonrecurring expense immediately following the Effective Time.

        The incremental fair value arising from the conversion of outstanding unvested HomeAdvisor (US) stock appreciation rights will be
amortized to expense over the remaining vesting period. In addition to adjustment (h) above, the pro forma adjustments related to the
conversion of these awards are described below.

(t) To reflect a one-time stock-based compensation charge of $74.2 million resulting from the conversion of existing vested
HomeAdvisor (US) equity awards into awards that are exercisable for Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices immediately
following the Effective Time and the related deferred tax asset of $27.4 million. 

(u) To reflect the incremental stock-based compensation expense related to the conversion of existing unvested HomeAdvisor (US)
and Angie's List denominated equity awards into equity awards of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock. The total fair
value of the converted Angie's List unvested stock options and restricted stock units and the incremental fair value arising from the
conversion of outstanding HomeAdvisor (US) unvested stock appreciation rights into awards that are exercisable for Class A
shares of ANGI Homeservices outstanding as of the Effective Time will be amortized to expense over the remaining vesting period
of these awards. The total estimated expense of $206.8 million ($138.8 million related to HomeAdvisor (US) equity awards and

to be issued in relation to the Merger.

        For the six months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, the calculation of the number of shares used in the
computation of pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share is as follows (in thousands):

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
HOMEADVISOR BUSINESS AND MYHAMMER, MYBUILDER AND HOMESTARS

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 are based on
the historical financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business after giving effect to the acquisition of controlling interests in MyHammer
on November 3, 2016, HomeStars on February 8, 2017, and MyBuilder on March 24, 2017 (collectively, the "Acquisitions"), and the
assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of
operations. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017 gives effect to
the acquisitions of MyBuilder and HomeStars. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the six months
ended June 30, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016 are presented as if the Acquisitions were completed on January 1, 2016.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and for the year ended
December 31, 2016 are not intended to be indicative of the results of operations of the HomeAdvisor Business that would have been
reported had the Acquisitions been completed as of the date presented, and should not be taken as a representative of the future results of
operations of the HomeAdvisor Business. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations have been presented for
informational purposes only. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of what the HomeAdvisor Business condensed
combined results of operations actually would have been had the Acquisitions been completed as of the date indicated. In addition, the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations does not purport to project the future combined operating results of the
HomeAdvisor Business.

        Pursuant to the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase prices as described in Note 3 below to the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statement of operations, have been allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair
values. The pro forma adjustments have been made solely for the purpose of providing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
statement of operations.

        Since the Acquisitions were completed prior to June 30, 2017, the HomeAdvisor Business balance sheet as of June 30, 2017 already
reflects the Acquisitions and, therefore, no pro forma balance sheet is presented.

HOMEADVISOR BUSINESS
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS 

Note 1. Description of Transactions

        On November 3, 2016, the HomeAdvisor Business acquired a 70% voting interest in MyHammer Holding AG ("MyHammer"), the
leading home services marketplace in Germany. On February 8, 2017, the HomeAdvisor Business acquired a 90% voting interest in
HomeStars Inc. ("HomeStars"), a leading home services platform in Canada. On March 24, 2017, the HomeAdvisor Business acquired a
75% voting interest in MyBuilder Limited ("MyBuilder"), a leading home services platform in the United Kingdom.

Note 2. Basis of Pro Forma Presentation

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase prices are allocated to the underlying MyHammer, HomeStars, and MyBuilder
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair market values as of the closing date of the
acquisitions with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations
for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016 are presented as if the Acquisitions were completed on
January 1, 2016.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and for year ended
December 31, 2016 are not intended to represent or be indicative of the results of operations of the HomeAdvisor Business that would
have been reported had the Acquisitions been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of the future
results of operations of the HomeAdvisor Business.

Note 3. Pre-Merger Pro Forma Adjustments

Estimated Purchase Price and Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation

        The HomeAdvisor Business acquired a (i) 70% voting interest in MyHammer for a total purchase price of €17.7 million (or
$19.7 million); (ii) 90% voting interest in HomeStars for a total purchase price of $16.6 CAD million (or $12.7 million); and (iii) 75%
voting interest in MyBuilder for a total purchase price of £32.6 million (or $40.7 million).

        In each case the purchase prices were based on the targets' expected financial performance, not on the value of the net identifiable
assets at the time of acquisition. This resulted in a significant portion of the purchase prices being attributed to goodwill because the
targets are believed to be complementary and synergistic to the existing HomeAdvisor Business.

        The following pro forma adjustments are included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations:

(a) To reflect incremental amortization expense associated with the valuation of the definite-lived intangible assets acquired in
the Acquisitions. The assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis based on their estimated useful lives. 

(b) To reflect the elimination of transaction related costs incurred by the HomeAdvisor Business related to the Acquisitions in
the amount of $1.1 million and $2.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31,
2016, respectively.

amount of $31 thousand and $0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016,
respectively. 

(d) To reflect the additional interest expense resulting from the Acquisitions. 

(e) To reflect the income tax effect of pro forma adjustments based on the estimated statutory tax rate of 37%. 

(f) To reflect the impact of the pro forma adjustments to the noncontrolling interests.

Table of Contents

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OF ANGI HOMESERVICES FOLLOWING THE MERGER 

Status as Controlled Company

        Upon completion of the Transactions, IAC will continue to control a majority of the voting power of ANGI Homeservices'
outstanding capital stock. As a result, ANGI Homeservices will be a "controlled company" under the NASDAQ Rules. As a controlled
company, ANGI Homeservices will be exempt from the obligation to comply with certain corporate governance requirements under the
NASDAQ Rules, including the requirements that:

• a majority of its board of directors be "independent" directors, as defined under the NASDAQ Rules; 

• it have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the
committee's purpose and responsibilities; and 

• it have a nominating/governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter
addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities.

        ANGI Homeservices will agree in the Investor Rights Agreement to avail itself of the exemptions available to a controlled company
so long as IAC's voting interest in ANGI Homeservices exceeds 50% (unless otherwise agreed to in advance by IAC). ANGI
Homeservices does not currently intend to establish a separate nominating/governance committee, and nomination and corporate
governance functions will be managed by the full board of directors until the NASDAQ Rules change, ANGI Homeservices ceases to be a
"controlled company" or ANGI Homeservices otherwise determines to do so (subject to IAC's consent if required under the Investor
Rights Agreement). The "controlled company" exemption does not modify the independence requirements for the audit committee of the
ANGI Homeservices board of directors, and ANGI Homeservices will comply with the requirements of the SEC and the NASDAQ Rules
requiring that its audit committee be composed exclusively of independent directors.

Initial Board of Directors and Post-Closing Nomination Procedures

        The Merger Agreement provides that the board of directors of ANGI Homeservices upon the completion of the Transactions will
consist of ten directors, with six directors designated by IAC, two directors designated by IAC who qualify as "independent" pursuant to
NASDAQ rules and the Exchange Act, and two directors selected by Angie's List from the Angie's List board of directors. The directors
selected by Angie's List will be Angela R. Hicks Bowman and Thomas R. Evans, if they continue to be able and willing to serve. For a
description of IAC's rights following the completion of the Transactions to nominate directors and the procedure for selecting any
successor(s) to Ms. Hicks Bowman and Mr. Evans prior to the date the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders of ANGI Homeservices is
held, see the section entitled "Ancillary Agreements—Investor Rights Agreement."

Director Independence

        Pursuant to the NASDAQ Rules, the ANGI Homeservices board of directors will have a responsibility to make an affirmative
determination that those members of its board of directors that serve as independent directors do not have any relationships with ANGI
Homeservices and its businesses that would impair their independence. In addition to determining whether each director satisfies the
independence requirements set forth in the NASDAQ Rules, in the case of members of the audit and compensation committees of the
ANGI Homeservices board of directors, the board of directors will also have to make an affirmative determination that such members also
satisfy separate independence requirements and current standards imposed by the SEC and the NASDAQ Rules for audit committee
members and by the SEC, the NASDAQ Rules and the Internal Revenue Service for compensation committee members. In connection
with these determinations, the board of directors will

Table of Contents

review information regarding transactions, relationships and arrangements involving ANGI Homeservices and its businesses and each of
its directors that the board of directors deems relevant to independence, including those required by the NASDAQ Rules and the rules of
the SEC and the Internal Revenue Service, as applicable. This information is obtained from director responses to a questionnaire that will
be circulated by the management of ANGI Homeservices, the records of ANGI Homeservices and publicly available information.
Following these determinations, the management of ANGI Homeservices will monitor those transactions, relationships and arrangements
that are relevant to such determinations, as well as solicit updated information potentially relevant to independence from internal personnel
and directors, in order to determine whether there have been any developments that could potentially have an adverse impact on prior
independence determinations by the board of directors.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

        The ANGI Homeservices board of directors will establish a compensation committee. It is expected that no member of ANGI
Homeservices' compensation committee (once formed) will be or will have been, during 2016, an officer or employee of ANGI
Homeservices or IAC or will have engaged in any transaction in which ANGI Homeservices or IAC was a participant of the type that is
required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. It is expected that no interlocking relationship will exist between the ANGI
Homeservices board of directors and its compensation committee and the board of directors or compensation committee of any other
company.

Committees of the ANGI Homeservices Board of Directors

        The ANGI Homeservices board of directors will establish standing committees in connection with the discharge of its responsibilities.
Upon the commencement of the trading of the Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices on NASDAQ, these committees will include an
audit committee and a compensation committee. The ANGI Homeservices board of directors may also establish such other committees as
it deems appropriate, in accordance with applicable law and regulations and the corporate governance documents of ANGI Homeservices.

Audit Committee

        The audit committee will function pursuant to a written charter adopted by the ANGI Homeservices board of directors. The audit
committee will be appointed by the board of directors to assist the board with a variety of matters described in the audit committee charter,
which include monitoring: (i) the integrity of the financial statements of ANGI Homeservices, (ii) the effectiveness of ANGI
Homeservices' internal control over financial reporting, (iii) the qualifications and independence of ANGI Homeservices' independent
registered public accounting firm, (iv) the performance of ANGI Homeservices' internal audit function and independent registered public
accounting firm, (v) the risk assessment and risk management policies of ANGI Homeservices as they relate to financial and other risk
exposures, and (vi) compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. In fulfilling its purpose, the audit committee will maintain free and
open communication among itself, ANGI Homeservices' independent registered public accounting firm, its internal auditors and
management. In addition, the Investor Rights Agreement will provide that the audit committee will be responsible (i) for compliance with

INFORMATION ABOUT THE HOMEADVISOR BUSINESS 

About the HomeAdvisor Business

        The HomeAdvisor Business, which is sometimes referred to in this section as "HomeAdvisor" for simplicity, is the operator of the
largest global home services marketplace, connecting homeowners with service professionals for home repair, maintenance and
improvement projects. HomeAdvisor's marketplace provides the tools and resources to allow homeowners to find local prescreened
service professionals and instantly book appointments online or through HomeAdvisor's award-winning mobile application.
HomeAdvisor's marketplace also provides consumers with other home services-related resources, including access to average project costs
using HomeAdvisor's True Cost Guide. In addition to its market-leading U.S. operations, the HomeAdvisor Business owns the leading
home services online marketplaces in Canada (HomeStars), Germany (MyHammer), France (Travaux.com) and the Netherlands
(Werkspot), as well as operations in Italy (Instapro) and the United Kingdom (MyBuilder). The HomeAdvisor Business also operates
Felix, a pay-per-call advertising service, and mHelpDesk, a provider of cloud-based field service software for small to mid-size businesses.

        As of June 30, 2017, the HomeAdvisor Business's network of service professionals in the United States consisted of approximately
164,000 paying professionals providing services in more than 500 categories ranging from simple home repairs to larger home remodeling
projects in more than 400 discrete geographies. The HomeAdvisor Business generated approximately 15.7 million service requests from
homeowners in the United States during the twelve months ended June 30, 2017.

        The HomeAdvisor Business operates in two segments: (i) North America, which is comprised of the brands HomeAdvisor,
HomeStars, Felix and mHelpDesk, and (ii) Europe, which is comprised of the brands MyHammer, Travaux.com, Werkspot, Instapro and
myBuilder.

The Home Services Market

        The HomeAdvisor Business serves a large and growing market. The total value of the home services market in the United States, in
particular, is estimated to be approximately $400 billion, according to Cowen and Company. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015
American Housing Survey, there are 74 million owner-occupied households in the United States and, on average, homeowners complete
over six jobs per year, according to HomeAdvisor's internal brand tracking study. The home services market is one of the few remaining
marketplaces in which digital penetration remains low. HomeAdvisor estimates that a significant portion of home-service requests are
fulfilled offline through word of mouth and referrals. HomeAdvisor expects the migration to online marketplaces for finding and booking
home services to accelerate in the future due to many factors, including: (i) the increased convenience and appeal of matching
homeowners with service professionals through the application of technology, facilitated by the increased consumer adoption of internet-
connected mobile devices, (ii) an increasing supply of digitally-savvy service professionals as more of them join online marketplaces as
part of the continued shift toward more efficient and trackable marketing solutions and (iii) favorable demographic trends, including
increasing homeownership by millennials, who HomeAdvisor believes are generally more willing to use online services than older
populations.

Services for Consumers

        Matching Services.    When a consumer submits a request through the HomeAdvisor marketplace, HomeAdvisor, using its proprietary
algorithm, generally matches that consumer with up to four service professionals from its network based on a number of factors, including
the type of services desired, service professional availability to accept jobs and the consumer's location. Consumers can then review
profiles of service professionals with whom they have been matched and select the professional whom they believe best meets their
specific needs. In addition to (or in lieu of) submitting a request through

the HomeAdvisor marketplace, consumers can also search, select and contact service professionals through HomeAdvisor's online
directory. In all cases, the consumer is under no obligation to work with service professionals referred by, or found through, HomeAdvisor.

        On-Demand Services.    HomeAdvisor also provides two on-demand services that complement its matching services: Instant Booking
and Instant Connect (patent-pending). Through Instant Booking, consumers can schedule appointments for select home tasks on-demand
with a pre-screened service professional instantly across HomeAdvisor's platforms (website or mobile application), and through Instant
Connect, consumers can connect with a service professional instantly via phone. In certain markets, HomeAdvisor offers a same-day
service functionality.

        Other Services.    In addition to matching and on-demand services, consumers can access HomeAdvisor's free, online True Cost
Guide, which provides project cost information for more than 400 project types on a local basis, as well as an online library of home
services-related resources, which consists primarily of articles about home improvement, repair and maintenance, tools to assist consumers
with the research, planning and management of their projects and general advice for working with service professionals.

        Consumers can also access HomeAdvisor services and tools on iOS and Android devices (including the Apple Watch) and through
HomeAdvisor's mobile application, as well as access its Instant Connect service through the Amazon Echo and its voice-controlled Alexa
personal assistant service.

Subscription Services for Service Professionals

        Service professionals who are new to the HomeAdvisor marketplace must sign up for an annual membership package. The basic
annual membership package includes membership in HomeAdvisor's network of service professionals, as well as a listing in the
HomeAdvisor online directory and matches through the marketplace. HomeAdvisor also offers subscription products that include custom
website development and hosting services, as well as integration with mHelpDesk.

Revenue

        HomeAdvisor's revenue is primarily derived from consumer connection revenue, which comprises fees paid by service professionals
for consumer matches (regardless of whether the professional ultimately provides the requested service) and membership subscription fees
paid by service professionals. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon certain factors including the service requested, type of
match (such as Instant Booking or Instant Connect) and where the service is provided.

Marketing

        HomeAdvisor markets its services to homeowners through search engine marketing, television advertising and affiliate agreements
with third parties. Pursuant to these affiliate agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote on their websites HomeAdvisor's
services and those of service professionals that participate in the HomeAdvisor network, and in exchange HomeAdvisor agrees to pay
these third parties a fixed fee when visitors from their websites submit a valid service request through the HomeAdvisor platform (on a
cost-per-acquisition basis) or click through to the HomeAdvisor platform (on a cost-per-click basis). HomeAdvisor also markets its
services to consumers through emails, digital display advertisements, partnerships with other contextually related websites and, to a lesser
extent, through direct mail and radio advertising. HomeAdvisor markets its subscription packages to service professionals primarily
through its sales force, as well as through search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade
associations and manufacturers.

Acquisition Strategy

        In addition to growing its brands organically, the HomeAdvisor Business opportunistically pursues acquisitions of brands, businesses,
products and technologies, including in new geographical markets into which HomeAdvisor seeks to expand. Acquisitions by the
HomeAdvisor Business within the last five years have included: Werkspot (April 2013); majority stakes in mHelpDesk (September 2014),
MyHammer (November 2016) and HomeStars (February 2017); and MyBuilder (March 2017).

Competition

        The home services industry is highly competitive, fragmented and, in many important respects, local. The HomeAdvisor Business
competes with, among others, (i) home services-related lead generation services, (ii) internet search engines and online directories and
(iii) various forms of local advertising, including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages, newspapers and other offline
directories. HomeAdvisor also competes with local and national retailers of home improvement products that offer or promote installation
services. HomeAdvisor believes its biggest competition comes from the traditional methods many people use to find service professionals:
word-of-mouth and referrals.

        HomeAdvisor believes that its ability to compete successfully will depend primarily upon the following factors:

• the size, quality (as determined, in part, by reference to its pre-screening process, ongoing quality control efforts and
customer ratings and reviews), diversity and stability of its network of service professionals and the quality of the services
they provide; 

• its ability to maintain a robust online marketplace for home services that consistently generates service requests that
convert into revenue for its network of service professionals in a cost-effective manner; 

• the functionality of its websites and mobile applications and the attractiveness of their features and its services generally to
consumers and service professionals, as well as its ability to introduce new products and services that resonate with
consumers and service professionals; and 

• its ability to continue to build and maintain awareness of, and trust in and loyalty to, the brands that are owned and
operated by the HomeAdvisor Business.

Intellectual Property

        The HomeAdvisor Business protects its intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, trade dress, domain name
registrations, trade secrets and patents applications, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on access to and use of proprietary
information.

        Registered trademarks of the HomeAdvisor Business include "HomeAdvisor" and "1-800-Contractor" in the United States, as well as
other trademarks in Canada and Europe. The HomeAdvisor Business has also filed other trademark applications in the United States and
certain other jurisdictions and will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent it believes it will be beneficial and cost-effective.

        The HomeAdvisor Business has one patent issued in the United States and four patent applications pending in the United States and
internationally. The HomeAdvisor Business intends to pursue additional patent protection to the extent it believes it will be beneficial and
cost-effective.

        One or more HomeAdvisor Entities is the registered holder of a variety of domestic and international domain names that include
"HomeAdvisor.com," "ServiceMagic.com," "HomeStars.com," "MyBuilder.com," "My-Hammer.de," "Travaux.com," "werkspot.nl" and
"instapro.it."

        In addition to the protection provided by the intellectual property rights of the HomeAdvisor Business, from time to time one or more
HomeAdvisor Entities enters into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with its employees, consultants, contractors and
business partners. Employees and contractors of the HomeAdvisor Business are also subject to invention assignment provisions. The
HomeAdvisor Business further controls the use of its proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both its
consumer and service professional terms of use on its websites and mobile applications.

Government Regulation

        The HomeAdvisor Business is subject to foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the
internet generally and through mobile applications, including laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for their
operations and the activities of their users. As a result, the HomeAdvisor Business could be subject to actions based on negligence, various
torts and trademark and copyright infringement, among other actions.

        Because the HomeAdvisor Business receives, stores and uses a substantial amount of information received from or generated by the
users of its online platforms, the HomeAdvisor Business is also impacted by laws and regulations governing privacy, the storage, sharing,
use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal data and data breaches, primarily in the case of its operations in the European Union
and its handling of personal data of users located in the European Union. As a result, the HomeAdvisor Business could be subject to
various private and governmental claims and actions.

        The HomeAdvisor Business is also subject to laws governing marketing and advertising activities conducted by telephone, email,
mobile devices, and the internet, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-
SPAM Act, and similar state laws.

        As a provider of products with a membership-based element, the HomeAdvisor Business is also subject to laws and regulations in
certain U.S. states and other countries that apply to its automatically-renewing membership payment models.

Merger, the combined business of ANGI Homeservices), see the section entitled "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Business of ANGI

its business, financial condition and results of operations."

        Rules of the SEC require the description of material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary, routine litigation incident to the
registrant's business) and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve damages claims for amounts
(exclusive of interest and costs) not exceeding 10% of the current assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In the
judgment of management of the HomeAdvisor Business, none of the pending litigation matters that it is defending, including that
described below, involves or is likely to involve amounts of that magnitude. The litigation matter described below involves issues or
claims that may be of particular interest to stockholders of ANGI Homeservices, regardless of whether this matter may be material to the

        Service Professional Class Action Litigation against HomeAdvisor.    In July 2016, a putative class action, Airquip,  Inc. v.
HomeAdvisor, Inc. et al., No. l:16-cv-1849, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The complaint, as amended,
alleges that HomeAdvisor engages in certain deceptive practices affecting the service professionals who join its network, including
charging them for substandard customer leads or failing to disclose certain charges. The complaint seeks certification of a nationwide class
consisting of all HomeAdvisor service professionals since October 2012, asserts claims including fraud and violation of the Colorado
Consumer Protection Act ("CCPA") and the federal RICO statute, and seeks injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount. In
December 2016, HomeAdvisor filed a motion to dismiss the RICO and CCPA claims, which remains pending. Discovery is under way,
and the issue of class certification remains to be litigated. The Company believes that the allegations in this lawsuit are without merit and
will continue to defend vigorously against them.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE
HOMEADVISOR BUSINESS 

        The following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the HomeAdvisor Business should be
read together with the historical combined financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business and the related notes and the other
information included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. See "Index to the Combined Financial Statements of the HomeAdvisor
Business." The historical combined financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business have been prepared on a standalone basis and are
derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of IAC. The combined financial statements reflect the historical
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the businesses comprising the HomeAdvisor Business since their respective dates
of acquisition by IAC and the allocation to the HomeAdvisor Business of certain IAC corporate expenses relating to the HomeAdvisor
Business based on the historical financial statements and accounting records of IAC. In the opinion of management of the HomeAdvisor
Business, the assumptions underlying the historical combined financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business, including the basis on
which the expenses have been allocated from IAC, are reasonable. However, the allocations may not reflect the expenses that the
HomeAdvisor Business may have incurred as an independent, standalone company (or as part of ANGI Homeservices) for the periods
presented. For the purposes of the historical combined financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business, income taxes have been
computed as if the entities comprising the HomeAdvisor Business filed on a standalone, separate tax return basis. The historical financial
results of the HomeAdvisor Business do not necessarily reflect what the historical financial position and results of operations would have
been had the HomeAdvisor Business been a standalone public company (or a part of ANGI Homeservices) during the periods presented.
In addition, the historical financial results of the HomeAdvisor Business are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any
future period, and results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

        The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The actual results, performance
and achievements of the HomeAdvisor Business could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a
result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus, particularly in the sections
entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors."

Overview

        The HomeAdvisor Business, which is comprised of HomeAdvisor (US), HomeAdvisor (International) and each of their respective
subsidiaries, and is sometimes referred to in this section as "HomeAdvisor," the "Company," "we," "our," or "us" for simplicity, is the
operator of the largest global home services marketplace, connecting homeowners with service professionals for home repair, maintenance
and improvement projects. HomeAdvisor's marketplace provides the tools and resources to allow homeowners to find local prescreened

using HomeAdvisor's True Cost Guide. In addition to its market-leading U.S. operations, the HomeAdvisor Business owns the leading
home services online marketplaces in Canada (HomeStars), which was acquired on February 8, 2017, Germany (MyHammer), which was
acquired on November 3, 2016, France (Travaux.com) and the Netherlands (Werkspot), as well as operations in Italy (Instapro) and the
United Kingdom (MyBuilder), which was acquired on March 24, 2017. The HomeAdvisor Business also operates Felix, a pay-per-call

400 discrete geographies. The HomeAdvisor Business generated approximately 15.7 million domestic service requests from homeowners
in the United States during the twelve months ended June 30, 2017.

HomeStars, Felix and mHelpDesk, and (ii) Europe, which is comprised of the brands MyHammer, Travaux.com, Werkspot, Instapro and

with third parties. Pursuant to these affiliate agreements, third parties agree to advertise and promote on their websites HomeAdvisor's
services and those of service professionals that participate in the HomeAdvisor network, and in exchange HomeAdvisor agrees to pay
these third parties a fixed fee when visitors from their websites submit a valid service request through the HomeAdvisor platform (on a
cost-per-acquisition basis) or click through to the HomeAdvisor platform (on a cost-per-click basis). HomeAdvisor also markets its
services to consumers through emails, digital display advertisements, partnerships with other contextually related websites and, to a lesser
extent, through direct mail and radio advertising. HomeAdvisor markets its subscription packages to service professionals primarily
through its sales force, as well as through search engine marketing, digital media advertising and direct relationships with trade
associations and manufacturers. We have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in online and offline advertising
to homeowners to promote our services and drive traffic to our platform and to service professionals to expand our network.

        In connection with the management of our businesses we identify, measure and assess a variety of key metrics. The principal metrics
we use in managing our business are set forth below:

• Domestic Revenue—reflects the HomeAdvisor-branded marketplace service and its owned affiliates. It excludes the other
businesses within the North America segment. 

• Domestic Service Requests—are fully completed and submitted customer service requests. 

• Domestic Paying Service Professionals (or "Domestic Paying SPs")—are the number of service professionals that had
an active membership and/or paid for consumer matches in the last month of the period.

Key Components of Results of Operations

Revenue

        Revenue is primarily derived from consumer connection revenue, which comprises fees paid by service professionals for consumer
matches (regardless of whether the professional ultimately provides the requested service) and membership subscription fees paid by
service professionals. Consumer connection revenue varies based upon certain factors including the service requested, type of match (such
as Instant Booking or Instant Connect) and where the service is provided.

        The Company's consumer connection revenue is generated and recognized when an in-network service professional is delivered a
consumer match. Membership subscription revenue is generated through subscription sales to service professionals and is deferred and
recognized over the term of the applicable membership. Membership agreements can be one month, three months, or one year. Deferred
revenue is $25.6 million, $18.8 million and $11.9 million at June 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Cost of revenue

        Cost of revenue consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs and credit card processing fees. Traffic acquisition costs consist of
amounts based on revenue share arrangements.

Selling and marketing expense

        Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of advertising expenditures and compensation (including stock-based
compensation) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in selling and marketing, and sales support. Advertising and
promotional expense includes online marketing, including fees paid to search engines, and offline marketing, which is primarily television
advertising and partner-related payments to those who direct traffic to our brands.

General and administrative expense

        General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation (including stock-based compensation) and other employee-
related costs for personnel engaged in executive management, finance, legal, tax, human resources and customer service functions, bad
debt expense, facilities costs and fees for professional services.

Product development expense

        Product development expense consists primarily of compensation (including stock-based compensation) and other employee-related
costs that are not capitalized for personnel engaged in the design, development, testing and enhancement of product offerings and related
technology.

Non-GAAP financial measure

        Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") —is a non-GAAP financial
measure. See the section entitled "—HomeAdvisor's Principles of Financial Reporting" for the definition of Adjusted EBITDA.

        North America selling and marketing expense increased $45.4 million, or 32%, in 2017 versus 2016, driven by organic growth of
online and offline marketing of $34.7 million and an increase of $9.3 million in compensation expense due primarily to an increase in sales
force headcount, as well as $1.2 million of expense from the inclusion of HomeStars.

        Europe selling and marketing expense increased $7.4 million, or 65%, in 2017 versus 2016, driven by organic growth of $3.3 million

transaction-related costs ($3.7 million related to the proposed Angie's List transaction and $0.4 million related to the acquisition of
HomeStars in 2017), $2.3 million in outsourced customer service expense and $1.3 million in software maintenance costs, as well as
$1.3 million of expense from the inclusion of HomeStars. The increase in compensation expense is due to an increase of $11.5 million in
stock-based compensation due primarily to the modification charge related to an equity award and the issuance of new equity awards since
the prior year, and an increase in headcount from business growth.

        Europe general and administrative expense increased $6.2 million, or 80%, in 2017 versus 2016, due primarily to $3.7 million of

Depreciation

        Depreciation increased by $2.4 million, or 64%, in 2017 versus 2016.

        North America depreciation increased $2.3 million, or 64%, in 2017 versus 2016, due primarily to the incremental depreciation
related to continued corporate growth.

Operating (loss) income

        Operating income decreased $10.4 million, to an operating loss of $1.4 million in 2017 versus operating income of $9.0 million in
2016.

        North America operating income decreased $3.4 million, or 29%, in 2017 versus 2016, primarily due to increases of $12.0 million in
stock-based compensation expense, $2.3 million in depreciation and $0.6 million in amortization of intangibles, partially offset by the
increase of $11.4 million in Adjusted EBITDA described below. The increase in stock-based compensation expense is due primarily to the
modification charge related to an equity award and the issuance of new equity awards since the prior year.

        Europe operating loss increased $7.0 million, or 267%, in 2017 versus 2016, primarily due to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss
of $4.9 million described below and an increase of $2.0 million in amortization of intangibles.

        At June 30, 2017, there was $56.6 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-based
awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 3.1 years.

Adjusted EBITDA

        Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined below in the section entitled "HomeAdvisor's Principles of
Financial Reporting." For a reconciliation of operating (loss) income for the Company's reportable segments and net earnings attributable
to IAC equity in HomeAdvisor Business to Adjusted EBITDA, see "Note 7—Segment Information" to the unaudited combined

        North America Adjusted EBITDA grew $11.4 million, or 57%, in 2017 versus 2016, due primarily to the increase in revenue,
partially offset by increased investment in online and offline marketing of $34.7 million, higher compensation expense due, in part, to
increased headcount, an increase of $5.3 million in bad debt expense due to higher revenue and $4.0 million in transaction-related costs
($3.7 million related to the proposed Angie's List transaction and $0.4 million related to the acquisition of HomeStars in 2017). Adjusted
EBITDA was further impacted by a $0.6 million write-off of deferred revenue related to the acquisition of HomeStars in 2017.

        Europe Adjusted EBITDA loss increased $4.9 million, or 395%, in 2017 versus 2016, driven primarily by our European expansion
strategy including increased investment in online and offline marketing of $3.3 million and higher compensation expense of $5.0 million
due, in part, to increased headcount and the inclusion of MyHammer and MyBuilder in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was also impacted by
$0.8 million in transaction-related costs in 2017.

        The 2017 income tax benefit is due primarily to the effect of adopting the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting, on January 1, 2017. Under ASU No. 2016-09, excess tax benefits generated by the settlement or
exercise of stock-based awards of $33.5 million in the first six months of 2017 are recognized as a reduction to the income tax provision
rather than additional paid-in capital.

        The 2016 effective income tax rate is higher than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to unbenefited losses in separate
jurisdictions.

        For further details of income tax matters, see "Note 2—Income Taxes" to the unaudited combined interim financial statements of the
HomeAdvisor Business included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests

        Noncontrolling interests represent the noncontrolling holders' percentage share of earnings or losses from the subsidiaries in which
the Company holds a majority, but less than 100%, ownership interest and the results of which are included in our combined financial
statements.

        Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2017 primarily represents the net losses attributable to the noncontrolling interests
in mHelpDesk, MyHammer, HomeStars and MyBuilder.

        Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2016 primarily represents the net losses attributable to the noncontrolling interests
in mHelpDesk.

        General and administrative expense increased $23.4 million, or 27%, in 2016 versus 2015.

        North America general and administrative expense increased $17.2 million, or 23%, in 2016 versus 2015, due primarily to higher
compensation expense of $8.2 million due, in part, to increased headcount, and increases of $4.7 million in bad debt expense due to higher
revenue and $1.3 million in software maintenance costs.

        Europe general and administrative expense increased $6.2 million, or 48%, in 2016 versus 2015, due primarily to higher
compensation expense of $2.6 million due, in part, to increased headcount including from the acquisition of MyHammer, as well as an
increase of $2.1 million in transaction-related costs in 2016.

For the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014

        General and administrative expense increased $14.9 million, or 21%, in 2015 versus 2014.

        North America general and administrative expense increased $19.9 million, or 37%, in 2015 versus 2014, due primarily to an increase
of $10.9 million in compensation resulting primarily from an increase in stock-based compensation expense and increased head count, an
increase of $4.1 million in bad debt expense due to higher revenue, an increase of $1.9 million in outsourced customer service expenses
and an increase of $1.2 million in software maintenance costs. Stock-based compensation expense increased $5.9 million in 2015 due to
the impact of a true up of estimated to actual forfeitures in 2014 and the issuance of new equity awards since the prior year.

        Europe general and administrative expense decreased $5.0 million, or 28%, in 2015 versus 2014, due primarily to decreases of
$1.7 million in bad debt expense and $1.4 million in compensation expense due, in part, to the closure of the Company's then-existing
operations in the United Kingdom in the fourth quarter of 2014.

Product development expense

For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015

        Product development expense increased $3.8 million, or 22%, in 2016 versus 2015.

        North America product development expense increased $4.2 million, or 31%, in 2016 versus 2015, driven by an increase of
$3.5 million in compensation and other employee-related costs due primarily to an increase in consultants, who were retained to
supplement our permanent development team.

        Europe product development expense decreased $0.5 million, or 15%, in 2016 versus 2015, driven by a decrease of $0.4 million in
compensation expense resulting from a higher number of capitalized projects in 2016 versus 2015.

For the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014

        Product development expense increased $4.9 million, or 41%, in 2015 versus 2014.

        North America product development expense increased $4.2 million, or 44%, in 2015 versus 2014, due primarily to an increase of
$4.2 million in compensation expense due, in part, to increased headcount.

        Europe product development expense increased $0.7 million, or 27%, in 2015 versus 2014, driven by an increase of $0.6 million in
compensation expense due, in part, to an increase in headcount.

For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015

        Depreciation increased $1.8 million, or 28%, in 2016 versus 2015.

        North America depreciation increased $2.2 million, or 39%, in 2016 versus 2015, due primarily to incremental depreciation
associated with capital expenditures related to a new sales center and an increase in internally developed software.

        Europe depreciation decreased $0.4 million, or 49%, in 2016 versus 2015, due primarily to certain fixed assets becoming fully
depreciated.

For the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014

        Depreciation increased $0.1 million, or 1%, in 2015 versus 2014.

Operating income (loss)

For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015

        Operating income increased $25.6 million in 2016 versus 2015.

        North America operating income increased $30.2 million, or 1,305%, due primarily to the increase of $31.9 million in Adjusted
EBITDA described below, and a decrease of $0.8 million in amortization of intangibles, partially offset by increases of $2.2 million in
depreciation and $0.4 million in stock-based compensation expense.

        Europe operating loss increased $4.5 million, or 117%, due primarily to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.1 million
described below, as well as increases of $0.7 million in stock-based compensation expense and $0.2 million in amortization of intangibles,
partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in depreciation.

        At December 31, 2016, there was $16.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to all equity-
based awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.5 years.

For the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014

        Operating income decreased $2.2 million, in 2015 versus 2014.

        North America operating income decreased $1.7 million, or 43%, in 2015 versus 2014, despite an increase of $0.9 million in Adjusted
EBITDA described below and a decrease of $5.3 million in amortization of intangibles, due primarily to increases of $7.1 million in stock-
based compensation and $0.8 million in depreciation. The decrease in amortization of intangibles is due primarily to a trade name
becoming fully amortized in 2014. The increase in stock-based compensation expense is due to the impact of a true up of estimated to
actual forfeitures in 2014 and the issuance of new equity awards since the prior year.

$0.8 million in depreciation and $0.5 million in amortization of intangibles.

Adjusted EBITDA

        Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined below in the section entitled "—HomeAdvisor's Principles of
Financial Reporting." For a reconciliations of operating income (loss) and net earnings (loss) attributable to IAC equity in HomeAdvisor
Business to Adjusted EBITDA, see "Note 9—Segment Information" to the audited combined financial statements of the HomeAdvisor
Business included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.

For the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015

        Adjusted EBITDA increased $27.8 million, or 167%, in 2016 versus 2015.

        North America Adjusted EBITDA grew $31.9 million, or 175%, in 2016 versus 2015, due primarily to an increase of $132.0 million
in revenue, partially offset by increased investment in online and offline marketing of $48.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA was further
impacted by higher compensation expense due, in part, to increased headcount and an increase in bad debt expense due to higher revenue.

        Europe Adjusted EBITDA loss increased $4.1 million, or 277%, in 2016 versus 2015, despite an increase of $5.7 million in revenue,
due primarily to increased investment in online marketing of $2.5 million, transaction-related costs of $2.1 million and higher
compensation expense due primarily to increased headcount. Adjusted EBITDA was further impacted by a $0.5 million write off of
deferred revenue related to the acquisition of MyHammer.

For the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014

        Adjusted EBITDA increased $0.3 million, or 2%, in 2015 versus 2014.

        North America Adjusted EBITDA grew $0.9 million, or 5%, in 2015 versus 2014, due primarily to higher revenue, partially offset by
increased investment in offline and online marketing, higher compensation expense, and increased bad debt expense and outsourced
customer service expenses.

        Europe Adjusted EBITDA loss increased $0.6 million, or 75%, in 2015 versus 2014, due primarily to lower revenue resulting from
the closure of the Company's then-existing operations in the United Kingdom in the fourth quarter of 2014.

        Interest expense—related party for the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 includes interest charged by IAC and its
subsidiaries on the outstanding long-term debt—related party notes, which are primarily related to acquisitions.

Other expense, net

        Other expense, net for the three-year period ended December 31, 2016 principally includes net foreign currency exchange losses.

Income tax provision

        In 2016, the effective income tax rate was higher than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to unbenefited losses in separate
jurisdictions and state taxes, partially offset by research credits.

        In 2015, the income tax provision is due primarily to an increase in income tax reserves and unbenefited losses in separate
jurisdictions, partially offset by research credits.

        In 2014, the income tax provision is due primarily to unbenefited losses in separate jurisdictions and state taxes, partially offset by
research credits.

        At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, of $0.6 million and $2.0 million,
respectively. Included in unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 and 2015, is approximately $0.6 million and $0.3 million,
respectively, for tax positions included in IAC's consolidated tax return filings. Unrecognized tax benefits, including interest, for the year
ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $1.4 million due principally to settlements. If unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2016 are
subsequently recognized, income tax expense would be reduced by $0.6 million. The comparable amount as of December 31, 2015 is
$1.9 million.

HomeAdvisor's Principles of Financial Reporting

        We report Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to GAAP. This measure is one of the primary metrics by which we evaluate
the performance of our businesses, on which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. We believe that
investors should have access to, and we are obligated to provide, the same set of tools that we use in analyzing our results. This non-
GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute
for or superior to GAAP results. We endeavor to compensate for the limitations of the non-GAAP measure presented by providing the
comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items,
to derive the non-GAAP measure. We encourage investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP
measure, which we discuss below.

Definition of HomeAdvisor's Non-GAAP Measure

        Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income excluding: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and
(3) acquisition-related items consisting of amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if
applicable. We believe this measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our
performance and that of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the performance of our
business as a whole and our individual business segments. The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because
these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash
operating income generated from our business, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. Adjusted EBITDA has
certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to our combined statement of operations of certain expenses.

        For a reconciliation of operating (loss) income by reportable segment and net (loss) earnings attributable to IAC equity in
HomeAdvisor Business to Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 and for the years ended December 31,
2016, 2015 and 2014, see Note 7 and Note 9 "—Segment Information" to the unaudited and audited combined financial statements of the
HomeAdvisor Business included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.

Non-cash expenses that are excluded from HomeAdvisor's Non-GAAP Measure

        Stock-based compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants of stock appreciation rights, stock
options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance-based RSUs. These expenses are not paid in cash. Upon the exercise of certain
stock appreciation rights, stock options and vesting of RSUs and performance-based RSUs, the awards are settled, at the Company's
discretion, on a net basis, with the Company remitting the required tax-withholding amount from its current funds.

        Depreciation is a non-cash expense relating to our property and equipment and is computed using the straight-line method to allocate
the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term, if
shorter.

        Amortization of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets are non-cash expenses. At the time of an
acquisition, the identifiable definite-lived intangible assets of the acquired company, such as technology, contractor relationships, customer
lists and user base, and trade names

Table of Contents

are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Value is also assigned to acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets, which comprise
trade names and trademarks, and goodwill that are not subject to amortization. An impairment is recorded when the carrying value of an
intangible asset or goodwill exceeds its fair value. While it is likely that we will have significant intangible amortization expense as we
continue to acquire companies, we believe that intangible assets represent costs incurred by the acquired company to build value prior to
acquisition and the related amortization and impairment charges of goodwill or intangible assets, if applicable, are not ongoing costs of
doing business.

Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources

        At June 30, 2017, we had $45.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. Internationally, cash equivalents primarily consist of AAA rated
government money market funds. Domestically, we participate in IAC's centrally managed U.S. treasury management function in which
IAC sweeps domestic cash of HomeAdvisor (US). Long-term debt—related party consists of various promissory notes. See "Note 9—
Related Party Transactions" to the unaudited combined interim financial statements and "Note 12—Related Party Transactions" to the
audited combined financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus for additional
information on Long-term debt—related party. At June 30, 2017, all cash and cash equivalents was held by entities that are part of the
HomeAdvisor Business and are organized and operate outside of the United States. If needed for our U.S. operations, all but $11.8 million
of the cash and cash equivalents held by these entities organized outside of the United States could be repatriated without incurring a
federal or state income tax liability. The estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with respect to the
$11.8 million of such earnings would be $3.6 million. We currently do not anticipate a need to repatriate these funds to finance our U.S.
operations and it is our intent to indefinitely reinvest these funds outside of the U.S., therefore, we have not provided for the $3.6 million
in U.S. income taxes related to these funds.

        HomeAdvisor (US) and certain of its wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are guarantors of IAC's 2013 Senior Notes (4.875% Senior
Notes due November 30, 2018; $361.9 million outstanding at June 30, 2017) and 2012 Senior Notes (4.75% Senior Notes due
December 15, 2022; $34.9 million outstanding at June 30, 2017). IAC's $300 million revolving credit facility, which terminates on
October 7, 2020 and is undrawn at June 30, 2017, is also unconditionally guaranteed by HomeAdvisor (US) and the same domestic
subsidiaries that guarantee the 2013 and 2012 Senior Notes and,

additionally, is secured by the stock of HomeAdvisor (US) and the stock of certain other domestic and foreign entities that are part of the
HomeAdvisor Business. At June 30, 2017, there are no outstanding borrowings under IAC's revolving credit facility. We have not recorded
a liability pursuant to this guarantor obligation because HomeAdvisor (US) has not agreed to pay a specific amount through an
arrangement with our co-obligors and we do not expect to pay any amount as a result of our guarantee of IAC's Senior Notes and IAC's
revolving credit facility. Upon completion of the Transactions, HomeAdvisor (US) and certain of its wholly owned domestic subsidiaries
will no longer guarantee any debt of IAC.

Cash flow information

        In summary, the Company's cash flow are as follows:

Six Months Ended June 30, 2017

        Net cash provided by operating activities consists of net earnings of $25.9 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $46.5 million
and a decrease from working capital activities of $41.4 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consist of $16.3 million of
stock-based compensation expense, $13.7 million of bad debt expense, $6.5 million of deferred income taxes, $6.2 million of depreciation
and $4.1 million of amortization of intangibles. The deferred income tax provision primarily relates to the settlement of stock-based
awards. The changes from working capital activities primarily consist of a decrease in income taxes payable of $36.9 million, an increase
in accounts receivable of $23.7 million, an increase in other current assets of $3.9 million, partially offset by an increase of $16.5 million
in accounts payable and other current liabilities and an increase in deferred revenue of $6.7 million. The decrease in income taxes payable
primarily relates to the settlement of stock-based awards. The excess tax benefit from stock-based awards was $33.5 million. The increase
in accounts receivable is primarily due to revenue growth at North America. The increase in other current assets is due to an increase in
prepaid marketing. The increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities is due to an increase in accrued advertising. The increase
in deferred revenue is due to growth in subscription sales to service professionals.

        Net cash used in investing activities includes $46.4 million of cash used for the acquisitions of MyBuilder and HomeStars, and capital
expenditures of $9.6 million, primarily related to our sales center and corporate headquarters expansion.

Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consist of $7.9 million of bad debt expense, $4.3 million of stock-based compensation expense
and $3.8 million of depreciation. The changes from working capital activities primarily consist of an increase in accounts payable and
other current liabilities of $11.9 million and an increase in deferred revenue of $5.0 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts
receivable of $15.9 million. The increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities is due to the timing of payments. The increase in
deferred revenue is primarily due to growth in subscription sales to service professionals. The increase in accounts receivable is primarily
due to revenue growth in North America.

        Net cash used in investing activities includes capital expenditures of $9.2 million primarily related to an increase in internally

        Net cash provided by operating activities consists of net earnings of $10.6 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $27.7 million
and an increase from working capital activities of $1.9 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consist of $17.4 million of bad
debt expense, $8.9 million of stock-based compensation expense, $8.4 million of depreciation, $7.7 million of excess tax benefits from
stock-based awards, $3.7 million of deferred income taxes, and $3.2 million of amortization of intangibles. The deferred income tax
benefit primarily relates to stock-based compensation expense. The changes from working capital activities primarily consist of an
increase of $14.9 million in accounts payable and other current liabilities, an increase in income taxes payable of $6.9 million, an increase
in deferred revenue of $6.9 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $23.9 million, and an increase in other current
assets of $3.0 million. The increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities is due to the timing of payments and an increase in
employee-related accruals. The increase in income taxes payable is due to current year income tax accruals in excess of current year
income tax payments. The increase in deferred revenue is due to growth in subscription revenue. The increase in accounts receivable is
primarily due to revenue growth in North America. The increase in other current assets is due to an increase in prepaid marketing.

Liquidity and capital resources

For periods prior to the Transactions

        Our principal sources of liquidity have historically been cash flows generated from operations and the funding we receive from IAC,
including loans from certain IAC foreign subsidiaries, which have been primarily used to fund acquisitions, as well as our cash and cash
equivalents. These sources have been sufficient to enable us to fund our normal operating requirements, including capital expenditures,
and our acquisitions. We believe these sources will continue to be sufficient to fund our normal operating requirements, including capital
expenditures, which we expect to be approximately 100% higher in 2017 than 2016 due to our sales center and corporate headquarters
expansion.

In connection with the Transactions

        All outstanding long-term debt—related party and amounts due between IAC and the HomeAdvisor Business, will be settled prior to
the completion of the Transactions, with the exception of a promissory note that will be issued to a foreign subsidiary of IAC that is not
part of the HomeAdvisor Business in an amount not to exceed €4.0 million.

        At or prior to the Closing, ANGI Homeservices and IAC or a subsidiary of IAC will enter into one or more intercompany loan
agreements (collectively referred to as the "Intercompany Note"), the form of which is an exhibit to the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the
Intercompany Note, IAC or a subsidiary of IAC will provide the funds necessary at the Effective Time to repay the outstanding balance
under Angie's List's existing credit agreement, which is $60.0 million as of June 30, 2017. ANGI Homeservices and its subsidiaries may
also request further advances under the Intercompany Note or under additional agreements substantially in the form of the Intercompany
Note following the Closing to cover general corporate purposes such as the provision of working capital, which IAC in its discretion may
agree to provide on the terms set forth in the Intercompany Note.

Table of Contents

        ANGI Homeservices currently intends to enter into a credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as
administrative agent and certain lenders after the Closing. The Credit Agreement is expected to provide for a five-year term loan A facility
not to exceed $275 million, and to be guaranteed by ANGI Homeservice's wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries. It is expected to
be secured by substantially all assets of ANGI Homeservices and the guarantors, subject to certain exceptions to be agreed. The proceeds
of the Credit Agreement, if any, are expected to be used to repay indebtedness outstanding to IAC and its subsidiaries, to pay fees and
expenses in connection with the Merger and for general corporate purposes, including working capital and dividends. The Credit
Agreement is expected to have affirmative, negative and financial covenants to be agreed among the lenders and ANGI Homeservices.
While ANGI Homeservices currently intends to enter into the Credit Agreement, it may determine not to do so.

        Immediately following completion of the Transactions, IAC is expected to hold Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices which,
together with Class A shares underlying equity awards in respect of HomeAdvisor (US) to be converted into awards in respect of ANGI
Homeservices, will represent between approximately 87% and 90% of the economic interest (on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the
treasury stock method) and approximately 98% of the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices common stock. For further details, see
the sections entitled "The Merger Agreement—Election Procedures for the Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration; Aggregate
Cap and Possible Proration of the Cash Consideration" and "—Determination of the Number of Class B Shares of ANGI Homeservices to
Be Issued to IAC." As a result, IAC will have the ability to control ANGI Homeservices' financing activities following the Closing,
including the issuance of additional debt and equity securities by ANGI Homeservices or any of its subsidiaries, or the incurrence of other
indebtedness generally. While ANGI Homeservices is expected to have the ability to access debt and equity markets if needed, such
transactions may require the approval of IAC due to its control of the majority of the outstanding voting power of ANGI Homeservices'
capital stock and its representation on the ANGI Homeservices board of directors. Additional financing may not be available on favorable
terms or at all.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

        Other than the items described above, we have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Foreign currency exchange risk

        We conduct business in certain foreign markets, principally in the European Union. For the six months ended June 30, 2017 and
2016, international revenue accounted for 9% and 8% of combined revenue, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015
and 2014, international revenue accounted for 8%, 9% and 16% of combined revenue, respectively. Our primary exposure to foreign
currency exchange risk relates to investments in foreign subsidiaries that transact business in a functional currency other than the U.S.
dollar, primarily the Euro. As foreign currency exchange rates change, translation of the statements of operations of our international
businesses into U.S. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results. The average Euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate
decreased 3% in the first six months of 2017 compared to 2016.

        Historically, we have not hedged any foreign currency exposures. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to
exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

        The following disclosure is provided to supplement the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in "Note 2—Summary of
significant accounting policies" to the audited combined financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business, included elsewhere in this
proxy statement/prospectus, in regard to significant areas of judgment. Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates,
judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its combined financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates,
judgments and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities as of the date of the combined financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Because of the
size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact
on our combined financial statements than others. What follows is a discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and
estimates.

Allowance for doubtful accounts

        The Company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when it has determined that
all or a portion of the receivable will not be collected. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors,
including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, its previous loss history, the specific customer's ability to pay its

219

(b) We lease office space, data center facilities and equipment used in connection with our operations under various
operating leases, the majority of which contain escalation clauses. In March 2017, we entered into a new 10.5 year
lease for our call center in New York and a new 10.5 year lease for our corporate headquarters in Denver, Colorado. 

(c) Purchase obligations primarily consist of advertising commitments. 

(d) We have excluded $0.6 million in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest from the table above as we are
unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid. For additional
information on income taxes, see "Note 2—Income Taxes" to the unaudited combined interim financial statements of
the HomeAdvisor Business included elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus.

obligations and the condition of the general economy and the customer's industry. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they
are determined to be uncollectible. The carrying value of the allowance for doubtful accounts is $9.2 million and $8.2 million at
December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Business combinations

        Acquisitions are an important part of the Company's growth strategy. The Company invested $53.4 million and $19.7 million in
acquisitions for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016. The purchase price of each acquisition is
attributed to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible
assets that either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. The fair value of these intangible assets is based on
detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. The excess purchase price over the net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets is recorded as goodwill and is assigned to the reporting unit(s) that is expected to benefit from the
combination as of the acquisition date.

Recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets

        Goodwill is the Company's largest asset with a carrying value of $171.0 million and $150.6 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Company's acquired trade names and trademarks, have a carrying
value of $4.9 million and $0.6 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

        Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually for impairment as of October 1 or, more frequently, if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-
lived intangible asset below its carrying value. In performing its annual assessment, the Company has the option to qualitatively assess
whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.

        For the Company's annual goodwill test at October 1, 2016, a qualitative assessment of the North America and Europe reporting units'
goodwill was performed because the Company concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was in
excess of their respective carrying values. The primary factors that the Company considered in its qualitative assessment for each of these
reporting units were valuations performed during 2016. These valuations were prepared primarily in connection with the issuance and/or
settlement of equity grants that are denominated in the shares of HomeAdvisor (US) or HomeAdvisor (International), as applicable, and
certain of their subsidiaries. The valuations were prepared time proximate to, but not as of, October 1, 2016. The Company determined
that the fair value of each of these reporting units was significantly in excess of its October 1, 2016 carrying value.

        While the Company has the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its indefinite-lived
intangible asset are less than its carrying value, the Company's policy is to determine the fair value of each of its indefinite-lived intangible
assets annually as of October 1. The Company determines the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets using an avoided royalty
discounted cash flow ("DCF") valuation analysis. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate
royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in the DCF
analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. The
royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license the
Company's trade names and trademarks. Assumptions used in the avoided royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty
rate, are assessed annually based

Table of Contents

on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rate used
in the Company's annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment was 17% in both 2016 and 2015, and the royalty rate used was 1% in
both 2016 and 2015.

        The 2016, 2015 and 2014 annual assessments identified no impairments.

Recoverability of long-lived assets

        We review the carrying value of all long-lived assets, comprising property and equipment, including leasehold improvements, and
definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset
may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment
loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds its fair value. In addition, the Company
reviews the useful lives of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these lives may be changed. The
carrying value of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is $29.6 million and $19.5 million at December 31, 2016 and
2015, respectively.

Income taxes

        We account for income taxes under the liability method, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is
more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the balance of deferred tax assets,
net, is $13.0 million and $12.3 million, respectively.

        We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for
recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on
audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest
amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This measurement step is inherently difficult and
requires subjective estimations of such amounts to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We consider many factors
when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately
anticipate actual outcomes. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had unrecognized tax benefits of $0.6 million and $2.0 million, including
interest, respectively. Changes to reserves from period to period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon resolution of issues
raised in audits and amounts previously provided may be material. Differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the
amounts owed by us are recorded in the period they become known.

        The ultimate amount of deferred income tax assets realized and the amounts paid for deferred income tax liabilities and uncertain tax
positions may vary from our estimates due to future changes in income tax law, state income tax apportionment or the outcome of any
review of our tax returns by the various tax authorities, as well as actual operating results of the Company that vary significantly from
anticipated results.

        No income taxes have been provided on indefinitely reinvested earnings of certain foreign entities comprising the HomeAdvisor
Business totaling $11.8 million at December 31, 2016. The estimated amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability with
respect to such earnings would be $3.6 million.

Stock-based compensation

        The stock-based compensation expense reflected in our combined statement of operations consists of expense related to stock
appreciation rights with respect to HomeAdvisor (US), IAC stock options and restricted stock units issued to employees of the
HomeAdvisor Business and equity awards denominated in the equity of certain other entities comprising the HomeAdvisor Business.

        Prior to the Transactions, the equity awards that relate to common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) or the common stock of certain other
entities comprising the HomeAdvisor Business are settleable in shares of IAC common stock having a value equal to the difference
between the exercise price and the fair market value of the common stock of the relevant entity of the HomeAdvisor Business. Upon
completion of the Transactions, the stock appreciation rights that relate to common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) will be converted into
awards that are exercisable for Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices, and the equity awards that relate to other entities comprising the
HomeAdvisor Business will be settleable, at IAC's election, in shares of IAC common stock or in Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices.
To the extent shares of IAC common stock are issued in settlement of the awards issued by entities comprising the HomeAdvisor Business
other than HomeAdvisor (US), ANGI Homeservices will reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing to IAC additional Class B
shares of ANGI Homeservices common stock. For IAC equity awards issued to employees of the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI
Homeservices will reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing to IAC, at IAC's election, either cash or additional Class B shares
of ANGI Homeservices common stock.

        We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The fair
value of stock appreciation rights and stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Fair value is recognized as
an expense on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period of the award.

        The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions, the most significant of
which include estimating the fair value of the underlying shares, expected term, expected volatility of the underlying shares, risk-free
interest rates and the expected dividend yield. In addition, the recognition of stock-based compensation expense is impacted by our
estimated forfeiture rates, which are based, in part, on historical forfeiture rates. The assumptions used in the option pricing model
represent IAC management's best estimates.

        Stock-based compensation expense related to HomeAdvisor (US) denominated stock appreciation rights represents the majority of
the combined HomeAdvisor Business stock-based compensation expense, exclusive of corporate allocations, for the six months ended
June 30, 2017 and the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The description below relates to the common stock and stock
appreciation rights of HomeAdvisor (US).

Valuations of HomeAdvisor (US)

        We estimated the fair value of the common stock and stock appreciation rights of HomeAdvisor (US) using the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model. The fair values of the common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) were approved by the Compensation and Human Resources
Committee of the IAC Board of Directors, or the IAC Committee, after consultation with IAC management and based on valuations
prepared by IAC management and, at certain times, valuations prepared by an unrelated third party valuation advisory firm. The IAC
Committee intended all awards granted to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of the common stock on
the grant date. In the absence of a public trading market of the shares of HomeAdvisor (US), the IAC Committee exercised its reasonable
judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to

determine what it believed to be the best estimate of the fair value of the shares of common stock of HomeAdvisor (US). These factors
generally included the following:

• actual operating and financial performance; 

• current business conditions and financial projections; 

• the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; 

• recent valuations performed at periodic intervals by an unrelated third-party valuation advisory firm; and 

• the U.S. capital market conditions.

        In valuing the shares of HomeAdvisor (US), we determined its equity value by assessing a combination of value indicators using a
market comparable approach and an income approach. The valuation method ultimately selected to determine the equity value was the
market comparable approach after determining that the resulting valuation was reasonable given the range of valuations determined using
the income approach.

Market comparable approach

        The market comparable approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a
selected peer group of companies. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to
financial metrics to estimate the value of HomeAdvisor (US).

        The peer group of companies was determined by considering companies relevant in terms of business function, monetization model,
and margin and growth characteristics operating in these sectors: lead generation, local reviews, eCommerce, and branded consumer
internet companies with strong earnings growth.

Income approach

        For the income approach, a discounted cash flow method was utilized to estimate the enterprise value based on the estimated present
value of future net cash flows we are expected to generate over a forecasted period and an estimate of the present value of cash flows
beyond that period. The present value was estimated using a discount rate, which accounts for the time value of money and the appropriate
degree of risks inherent in the business. For these valuations, we prepared financial projections to be used in the income approach. The
financial projections took into account the historical financial results of operations, business experiences and future expectations of
HomeAdvisor (US). The risk associated with achieving these forecasts was used to select the appropriate exit multiple and discount rate.
There is inherent uncertainty in these estimates, as the assumptions used were highly subjective and subject to change as a result of new
operating data and economic and other conditions that impact the business.

Option-pricing model

        The key assumptions used in the option-pricing model to value HomeAdvisor (US) denominated stock appreciation rights are
estimated as follows:

• Fair value of shares.  Because the shares of HomeAdvisor (US) have no publicly traded history, we must estimate the grant
date fair value of these shares, as described above. 

• Expected term.  The stock appreciation rights of HomeAdvisor (US) have generally had one window each year during
which a holder could exercise their awards and the expected term is based upon the mid-point of the first and last exercise
window.

• Expected volatility.  In the absence of a trading history for the common stock of HomeAdvisor (US), we estimated the
expected price volatility of these stock appreciation rights by making reference to the peer group of companies used in the
preparation of valuations. 

• Risk-free interest rate.  We base the risk-free interest rate for all awards on U.S. Treasuries equal to the expected term of the
award on the grant date. 

• Expected dividend yield.  The expected dividend assumption for the stock appreciation rights was zero at the time of grant
based on the then-current expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future.

        The following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions used in the option pricing model for grants made during the
periods indicated for the stock appreciation rights of HomeAdvisor (US).

        In addition to the above assumptions, we also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate stock-based compensation expense, which is
based on an analysis of historical forfeitures.

        Based on the Black-Scholes assumptions in the table above, the weighted average fair value of stock appreciation rights granted
during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the six months ended June 30, 2017, are $3.13, $1.34 and $8.24, respectively.

ANGI HOMESERVICES COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

        This Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides information regarding the compensation philosophy, policies, and practices
with respect to the compensation of ANGI Homeservices' principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and three other most
highly compensated executive officers, collectively referred to as ANGI Homeservices' "named executive officers," for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2016. The named executive officers covered by this Compensation Discussion and Analysis have been determined
based on the individuals who are expected to serve as executive officers of ANGI Homeservices following completion of the Transactions.
Based on this methodology, ANGI Homeservices' named executive officers for the 2016 fiscal year were:

• Chris Terrill, Chief Executive Officer; 

• William B. Ridenour, Chief Technology Officer; 

• Craig Smith, President and Chief Operating Officer; 

• Glenn H. Schiffman, IAC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who also will serve as ANGI
Homeservices' Chief Financial Officer; and 

• Allison Lowrie, Chief Marketing Officer.

        During 2016, Messrs. Terrill, Ridenour, and Smith, and Ms. Lowrie were employees of, and received compensation from,
HomeAdvisor (US) and Mr. Schiffman was an employee of, and received compensation from, IAC.

Roles and Responsibilities

        To date, executive officer compensation (other than with respect to Mr. Schiffman) has been predominantly determined by IAC.
Mr. Schiffman serves as a named executive officer of IAC and, as such, all decisions relating to his compensation were made by the
Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors of IAC (the "IAC Committee").

        Following completion of the Transactions, ANGI Homeservices will have a separate board of directors as described in the section
entitled "Board of Directors and Executive Officers of ANGI Homeservices Following the Merger," which board of directors will in turn
have a compensation committee with the responsibility of establishing ANGI Homeservices' compensation philosophy and programs and
determining appropriate payments and awards to ANGI Homeservices' executive officers, other than Mr. Schiffman, with respect to whom
the IAC Committee will continue to make such determinations.

        This Compensation Discussion and Analysis deals exclusively with historical information while the HomeAdvisor Business has been
a part of IAC, and is not necessarily indicative of future philosophy when ANGI Homeservices is a publicly traded company.

        In general, IAC has been responsible for establishing bonus pools and equity pools for employees of the HomeAdvisor Business,
other than Mr. Schiffman, and such pools have been allocated throughout the HomeAdvisor Business, with Mr. Terrill making the
determinations for most other executive officers, and IAC directly establishing the bonus and equity awards for Mr. Terrill.

        Neither ANGI Homeservices nor IAC has an ongoing relationship with any particular compensation consulting firm, though IAC has
from time to time retained the services of consultants on specific occasions.

Table of Contents

Philosophy and Objectives

        The historical compensation program for executive officers of HomeAdvisor (US) was designed to increase long-term value by
attracting, retaining, motivating, and rewarding leaders with the competence, character, experience, and ambition necessary to enable the
HomeAdvisor Business to meet its growth objectives.

        When establishing compensation packages for a given executive, IAC followed a flexible approach, and has made decisions based on
a host of factors particular to a given executive situation, including its firsthand experience with the competition for recruiting and
retaining executives; negotiation and discussion with the relevant individual; competitive survey data; internal equity considerations; and
other factors IAC deemed relevant at the time.

        Similarly, IAC has not followed an arithmetic approach to establishing compensation levels and measuring and rewarding
performance, as IAC believes this approach often fails to adequately take into account the multiple factors that contribute to success at the
individual and business level. In any given period, IAC may have had multiple objectives, and these objectives, and their relative
importance, often change as the competitive and strategic landscape shifts, even within a given compensation cycle. As a result, formulaic
approaches often over-compensate or under-compensate a given performance level. Accordingly, IAC has historically avoided the use of
strict formulas in its compensation practices and has relied primarily on a discretionary approach.

Benchmarking

        While IAC considers market data in establishing broad compensation programs and practices and may periodically benchmark the
compensation associated with particular executive positions, IAC does not definitively rely on competitive survey data or any
benchmarking information in establishing executive compensation. IAC makes decisions based on a host of factors particular to a given
executive's situation, including those described above and its understanding of the current environment, and believes that over-reliance on
survey data, or a benchmarking approach, is too rigid and stale for the dynamic and fast changing marketplace for talent.

Compensation Elements

        Compensation packages for executive officers have primarily consisted of salary, annual bonuses, long term incentives (typically
equity awards), perquisites, and other benefits. Prior to making specific decisions related to any particular element of compensation, IAC
typically reviews the total compensation of each executive officer, evaluating the executive officer's total near- and long-term
compensation in the aggregate. IAC determines which element or combinations of compensation elements (salary, bonus, or equity) can be
used most effectively to further its compensation objectives. However, all such decisions are subjective, and made on a facts-and-
circumstances basis without any prescribed relationship between the various elements of the total compensation package.

Salary

        A new executive officer's starting salary is typically negotiated upon arrival, based on the executive officer's prior compensation
history, prior compensation levels for the particular position, the executive officer's location, salary levels of other executive officers,
salary levels available to the individual in alternative opportunities, reference to certain survey information, and the extent to which IAC
desires to secure the executive officer's services.

        Once established, salaries can increase based on a number of factors, including the assumption of additional responsibilities, internal
equity, periodic market checks, and other factors that demonstrate an executive officer's increased value.

Annual Bonuses

        General.    The annual bonus program is designed to reward performance on an annual basis. Because of the variable nature of the
bonus program, and because in any given year bonuses have the potential to make up a significant portion of an executive officer's total
compensation, the bonus program provides an important incentive tool to achieve annual objectives.

        Historically, after consultation with HomeAdvisor (US) management, IAC established the annual bonus pool for the HomeAdvisor
Business based on its assessment of the performance of the HomeAdvisor Business for the completed year. In large part, success has been
measured based on growth in revenue and profitability of the HomeAdvisor Business, but success is measured subjectively both in
absolute terms over the prior year and in comparison to the competitors of the HomeAdvisor Business, taking into account economic and
other factors, without any pre-established targets. Additionally, consideration has sometimes been given to achievement of various
strategic objectives over the course of the year, and other factors IAC and HomeAdvisor (US) management deemed relevant. No
quantified weight has been given to any particular consideration and there has generally been no formulaic calculation. Rather, IAC has
engaged in an overall assessment of appropriate bonus levels based on a subjective interpretation of corporate performance.

        IAC has established the bonuses of Messrs. Terrill and Ridenour in large part based on the same considerations used in establishing
the bonus pool for the HomeAdvisor Business generally. Mr. Terrill has then generally been responsible for allocating the remainder of the
bonus pool to the rest of the company, including the other executive officers, other than Messrs. Ridenour and Schiffman.

        IAC has historically paid annual bonuses shortly after year-end following finalization of financial results for the prior year.

        Executive officer bonuses tend to be highly variable from year-to-year depending on performance of the applicable company and, in
certain circumstances, individual executive officer performance.

        2016 Annual Bonus.    In setting bonus amounts for 2016, consideration was given to the overall performance of the applicable
company (IAC, for Mr. Schiffman, and HomeAdvisor (US) for the other named executives), the amount of bonus for each named
executive officer relative to other IAC executives for Mr. Schiffman and other executive officers of HomeAdvisor (US) for the other
named executive officers and, with respect to Mr. Schiffman, the recommendations of IAC's Chairman and Senior Executive and its Chief
Executive Officer. In addition, 2016 achievements were considered, and compared to achievements and bonus levels in prior years.

        Mr. Schiffman.    In setting the actual bonus level for Mr. Schiffman in 2016, the IAC Committee considered a variety of factors,
including the following: (i) IAC's revenue decreased modestly year over year, while its Adjusted EBITDA increased modestly year over
year, (ii) IAC returned over $315 million to stockholders during 2016 by way of share repurchases and otherwise effectively managed its
capitalization and cash position, and (iii) IAC took steps to positively advance the strategic position of several of its businesses. While the
factors noted above were the primary ones considered in setting bonus award amounts for Mr. Schiffman, the IAC Committee also
considered Mr. Schiffman's role and responsibilities, the relative contributions made by Mr. Schiffman during the year and the relative size
of the bonuses paid to the other executive officers of IAC. The IAC Committee also considered Mr. Schiffman's new role as Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and his oversight of cost-cutting initiatives.

        Other Named Executives.    In 2016, the HomeAdvisor Business experienced strong growth in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA and
grew its service provider network in the United States by over 40%; it also made progress on a number of important strategic initiatives in
product development. As a result, IAC determined to pay Mr. Terrill a bonus of $900,000 and Mr. Ridenour a bonus of $600,000.

227



9/10/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1491778/000104746917005453/a2233101zdefm14a.htm

Table of Contents

Likewise, Mr. Smith and Ms. Lowrie received bonuses of $500,000 and $375,000, respectively, based primarily on Mr. Terrill's view of
corporate performance and individual contributions. As noted above, in setting individual bonus amounts, there was no weight assigned to
any specific factor, and no application of a formulaic calculation.

Long-Term Incentives

        General.    IAC believes that tying the compensation of executive officers to an increase in value of the business for which they work
will drive focus and performance, which in turn will benefit IAC stockholders.

        Employees of the HomeAdvisor Business have historically received (i) equity awards denominated in shares of IAC common stock,
(ii) equity awards denominated in shares of HomeAdvisor (US), and (iii) in 2016, equity awards denominated in shares of certain other
subsidiaries of the HomeAdvisor Business.

        In setting particular award levels, the predominant objectives have been providing the person with effective retention incentives,
appropriate reward for past performance, and incentives for strong future performance. Appropriate levels to meet these goals may vary
from year to year, and from individual to individual, based on a variety of factors. The annual corporate performance factors relevant to
setting bonus amounts that were discussed above, while taken into account, have generally been less relevant in granting annual equity
awards, as the awards tend to be more forward looking, and are a longer-term retention and reward instrument than annual bonuses.

        The IAC Committee made all determinations regarding grants of equity awards to the named executive officers, in consultation with
IAC senior management. In assessing the appropriate level of awards, IAC took into account historical practices, its view of market
compensation generally, the dilutive impact of equity grants across IAC, and other relevant factors.

        Prior to the Transactions, the equity awards that relate to common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) or the common stock of certain other
HomeAdvisor Entities are settleable in shares of IAC common stock having a value equal to the difference between the exercise price and
the fair market value of the common stock of the relevant HomeAdvisor Entity. Upon completion of the Transactions, the stock
appreciation rights that relate to common stock of HomeAdvisor (US) will be converted into awards that are exercisable for Class A shares
of ANGI Homeservices, and the equity awards that relate to other HomeAdvisor Entities will be settleable, at IAC's election, in shares of
IAC common stock or in Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices.

        To the extent shares of IAC common stock are issued in settlement of the awards issued by HomeAdvisor Entities other than
HomeAdvisor (US), ANGI Homeservices will reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by issuing to IAC additional Class B shares of
ANGI Homeservices common stock. For IAC equity awards issued to employees of the HomeAdvisor Business, ANGI Homeservices will
reimburse IAC for the cost of those shares by, at IAC's election, either paying IAC cash or issuing to IAC additional Class B shares of
ANGI Homeservices common stock.

        For a description of the equity awards granted to employees of the HomeAdvisor Business, see "Note 8—Stock-Based
Compensation" to the historical combined financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business contained elsewhere in this proxy
statement/prospectus.

        2016 Equity Awards.    In February 2016, in connection with IAC's normal course annual compensation practice, IAC granted
350,000 HomeAdvisor (US) stock appreciation rights to Mr. Smith and 400,000 HomeAdvisor (US) stock appreciation rights to
Ms. Lowrie, each with a per share exercise price of $9.86, vesting in equal annual installments over four years, and IAC granted 50,000
IAC stock options to Mr. Terrill and 40,000 IAC stock options to Mr. Ridenour, each with a per share exercise price of $45.22, vesting in
equal annual installments over four years. On May 12, 2016, in connection

with an internal reorganization of the HomeAdvisor Business, IAC granted 7,500 Home Advisor (International) stock appreciation rights
to Mr. Terrill, 7,500 HomeAdvisor (International) stock appreciation rights to Mr. Ridenour, and 10,000 Home Advisor (International)
stock appreciation rights to Mr. Smith, each with a per share exercise price of $28.89, vesting in equal annual installments over four years.
And on December 1, 2016, IAC granted 5,000 IAC stock options to each of Messrs. Terrill, Ridenour and Smith and to Ms. Lowrie, each
with a per share exercise price of $65.82, vesting on the fourth anniversary of the grant date.

        As further described below, in connection with the execution of his employment agreement upon joining IAC, on April 7, 2016,
Mr. Schiffman received a grant of 200,000 IAC stock options, with a per share exercise price of $45.78, vesting in equal annual
installments over four years.

Employment Agreements

        Employment Agreement with Mr. Schiffman.    Effective April 7, 2016, IAC and Mr. Schiffman entered into an employment
agreement, pursuant to which Mr. Schiffman became IAC's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The employment
agreement has a scheduled term of one year from the effective date of the employment agreement and provides for automatic renewals for
successive one-year terms absent written notice from IAC or Mr. Schiffman 90 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term.

        The employment agreement provides that Mr. Schiffman will be eligible to receive an annual base salary (currently $600,000),
discretionary annual cash bonuses, equity awards, and such other employee benefits as may be reasonably determined by the IAC
Committee. Upon joining IAC, Mr. Schiffman was granted 200,000 IAC stock options that vest in equal annual installments over four
years, subject to Mr. Schiffman's continued employment with IAC, and have an exercise price equal to $45.78.

        Upon certain involuntary terminations of Mr. Schiffman's employment and subject to his execution and non-revocation of a release of
claims in favor of IAC and compliance with the restrictive covenants set forth in the employment agreement: (i) IAC will continue to pay
Mr. Schiffman his annual base salary for one year following such termination, (ii) the options granted to Mr. Schiffman in connection with
his joining IAC will vest as of the date of such termination, (iii) all other IAC equity awards (including any cliff-vesting awards, which
will be prorated as though such awards had an annual vesting schedule) held by Mr. Schiffman that would have otherwise vested during
the one-year period following such termination will vest as of the date of such termination and (iv) all vested and outstanding IAC stock
options held by Mr. Schiffman as of the date of such termination (including any stock options that vested pursuant to the acceleration
rights described above) will remain outstanding and exercisable for 18 months from the date of such termination.

        Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. Schiffman is bound by a covenant not to compete with IAC's businesses during the term
of his employment and for 12 months after certain involuntary terminations, and covenants not to solicit IAC's employees or business
partners during the term of his employment and for 18 months after such a termination. In addition, Mr. Schiffman has agreed not to use or
disclose any confidential information of IAC or its affiliates.

        Employment Agreement with Chris Terrill.    Mr. Terrill is party to an employment agreement, dated May 16, 2011, with
HomeAdvisor (US) pursuant to which Mr. Terrill currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of HomeAdvisor (US). The employment
agreement had an initial four-year term and provides for automatic renewals for successive one-year terms absent written notice from
HomeAdvisor (US) or Mr. Terrill 90 days prior to the expiration of the then-current term.

        The employment agreement provides that Mr. Terrill will be eligible to receive an annual base salary (currently $400,000),
discretionary annual cash bonuses, and such other employee benefits as may be determined by HomeAdvisor (US).

Table of Contents

        Upon certain involuntary terminations of Mr. Terrill's employment and subject to his execution and non-revocation of a release of
claims in favor of HomeAdvisor (US) and compliance with the restrictive covenants set forth in the employment agreement HomeAdvisor
(US) will continue to pay Mr. Terrill his annual base salary for one year following such termination.

        Pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. Terrill is bound by a covenant not to compete with HomeAdvisor (US)'s businesses
during the term of his employment and for 12 months thereafter, and covenants not to solicit HomeAdvisor (US)'s employees or business
partners during the term of his employment and for 18 months after such a termination. In addition, Mr. Terrill has agreed not to use or
disclose any confidential information of HomeAdvisor (US) or its affiliates.

        Prior to the consummation of the Transactions, ANGI Homeservices expects to enter into an employment agreement with Mr. Terrill,
which will be effective subject to, and upon the consummation of, the Transactions. The terms of the ANGI Homeservices employment
agreement are expected to be substantially similar to the terms of the employment agreements entered into between ANGI Homeservices
and Messrs. Ridenour and Smith and Ms. Lowrie. See "—ANGI Homeservices Compensation Program Following the Transactions—
Employment Agreements with William B. Ridenour, Craig Smith, and Allison Lowrie."

        Employment Agreements with William B. Ridenour, Craig Smith and Allison Lowrie.    As described in "—ANGI Homeservices
Compensation Program Following the Transactions—Employment Agreements with William B. Ridenour, Craig Smith and Allison
Lowrie," ANGI Homeservices has entered into employment agreements with each of Messrs. Ridenour and Smith and Ms. Lowrie, which
will become effective subject to, and upon the consummation of, the Transactions.

Change in Control and Severance

        IAC believes that providing executive officers with severance and change in control protection is critical to allowing executive
officers to fully value the forward looking elements of their compensation packages, and therefore limit retention risk during uncertain
times. Accordingly, equity awards granted to employees of the HomeAdvisor Business generally provide for varying degrees of
accelerated vesting in the event of a change in control. These benefits, which generally are payable if the executive officer's employment is
terminated without cause or the executive resigns with good reason are described in the section of this proxy statement/prospectus entitled
"ANGI Homeservices Executive Compensation—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control."

Other Compensation

        Under limited circumstances, certain of the ANGI Homeservices named executive officers have received non-cash and non-equity
compensatory benefits. The executive officers do not participate in any deferred compensation or retirement program other than IAC's
401(k) plan.

        As part of the agreement for Mr. Schiffman to move to the New York City metropolitan area to accept the position of Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer of IAC, IAC agreed to compensate Mr. Schiffman for various costs of relocating from Austin, Texas,
including airfare for certain trips between the New York City metropolitan area and Austin, Texas until his family joined him in the New
York City metropolitan area during the third quarter of 2016, the payment of certain brokerage fees in connection with the disposition of
his home, costs of temporary housing, moving expenses and associated tax gross-ups. IAC does not expect these amounts to be recurring,
and though the applicable compensation disclosure rules require disclosure of the value of these items as compensation, they were not
taken into account in determining the other components of Mr. Schiffman's compensation, as IAC views them as a cost to IAC in
facilitating Mr. Schiffman's move to the New York City metropolitan area.

Tax Deductibility

        IAC's practice is to structure compensation programs in such a manner so that the compensation is deductible by IAC for federal
income tax purposes. However, because ANGI Homeservices' executive officers will now be subject to the limitations on deductibility
under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and were not previously, certain compensatory arrangements
established prior to the Transactions but that will be paid following the completion of the Transactions may not result in deductible
compensation for ANGI Homeservices.

ANGI HOMESERVICES COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTIONS 

        ANGI Homeservices believes that, following the completion of the Transactions, ANGI Homeservices will need to maintain
flexibility in designing compensation programs to attract, motivate, and retain ANGI Homeservices executives, including permitting
ANGI Homeservices to regularly compensate executive officers with non-cash compensation reflective of ANGI Homeservices' stock
performance in the form of publicly traded equity. Accordingly, ANGI Homeservices intends to adopt the ANGI Homeservices Inc. 2017
Stock and Annual Incentive Plan (the "2017 Plan") as described in "—ANGI Homeservices Inc. 2017 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan"
below, and has entered into employment agreements with each of Messrs. Ridenour and Smith and Ms. Lowrie, as described in "—
Employment Agreements with William B. Ridenour, Craig Smith and Allison Lowrie" below.

        While ANGI Homeservices is still in the process of determining specific details of the compensation program that will take effect
following the completion of the Transactions, it is anticipated that ANGI Homeservices' compensation program following the completion
of the Transactions will be based on the same principles and designed to achieve the same objectives as the historical compensation
program in place at the HomeAdvisor Business.

ANGI Homeservices Inc. 2017 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan

        Prior to the completion of the Transactions, ANGI Homeservices expects to adopt a stock and annual incentive plan that will be
effective upon completion of the Transactions and will have terms substantially as set forth below.

Overview

        The purpose of the 2017 Plan is to give ANGI Homeservices a competitive advantage in attracting, retaining, and motivating officers
and employees and to provide them with incentives that are directly linked to the future growth and profitability of ANGI Homeservices
and its businesses.

        The 2017 Plan will replace the HomeAdvisor 2013 Incentive Plan, which is referred to as the "Prior Plan," and the Prior Plan will be
automatically terminated and replaced and superseded by the 2017 Plan. Any awards granted under the Prior Plan, which are referred to as
"Prior Plan Awards" will remain in effect pursuant to their terms under the 2017 Plan.

        The 2017 Plan also will cover any shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock that may be delivered in settlement of equity
awards in certain subsidiaries within ANGI Homeservices. For purposes of this summary, these awards are referred to as "Subsidiary
Equity Awards." For a description of these Subsidiary Equity Awards, see "Note 8—Stock-Based Compensation" to the historical
combined financial statements of the HomeAdvisor Business contained elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. See also "Ancillary
Agreements—Employee Matters Agreement" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations of the HomeAdvisor Business—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Stock-based compensation."

Summary of Terms of the 2017 Plan

        The principal features of the 2017 Plan are described below. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of
the 2017 Plan, a copy of which has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a
part.

        Administration.    The 2017 Plan will be administered by the compensation committee of the ANGI Homeservices board of directors
(or such other committee of the board of directors as the full board may from time to time designate). Among other things, the
compensation committee will have the authority to select individuals to whom awards may be granted, to determine the types of awards
(as

well as the number of shares of common stock to be covered by each such award) granted, and to determine and modify the terms and
conditions of any such awards.

        Eligibility.    In addition to any individuals who hold Prior Plan Awards and/or Subsidiary Equity Awards at any time, current or
prospective officers, employees, directors, and consultants of ANGI Homeservices and its subsidiaries and affiliates will be eligible to be
granted awards under the 2017 Plan.

        Shares Subject to the 2017 Plan.    The aggregate number of shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock that may be
delivered to satisfy awards under the 2017 Plan (including awards previously granted under the HomeAdvisor Inc. 2013 Incentive Plan)
cannot exceed 75 million shares. No participant may be granted, in each case, during any calendar year: (a) performance-based awards
(other than stock options and stock appreciation rights ("SARs")) intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code covering in excess
of 10 million shares; or (b) stock options and SARs covering in excess of 10 million shares. The maximum number of shares that may be
granted pursuant to incentive stock options is 10 million. The foregoing share limits are subject to adjustment in certain circumstances by
the compensation committee to prevent dilution or enlargement.

        The shares subject to grant under the 2017 Plan will be made available from authorized but unissued shares or from treasury shares,
as determined from time to time by the ANGI Homeservices board of directors. To the extent that any award is forfeited or any stock
option or SAR terminates, expires, or lapses without being exercised or any award is settled for cash, the shares underlying such awards
will again be available for awards under the 2017 Plan. If the exercise price of any stock option and/or the tax withholding obligations
relating to any award are satisfied by a participant delivering shares (by either actual delivery or by attestation), only the number of shares
issued net of the shares delivered or attested to will be deemed delivered for purposes of the limits in the 2017 Plan. To the extent any
shares subject to an award are withheld to satisfy the exercise price (in the case of a stock option) and/or the tax withholding obligations
relating to any award, such shares are not deemed to have been delivered for purposes of the limits set forth in the plan.

        Stock Options and SARs.    Stock options granted under the 2017 Plan can either be incentive stock options ("ISOs"), or nonqualified
stock options. SARs granted under the 2017 Plan can be granted either alone or in tandem with a stock option. The exercise price of
options and SARs cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of the stock underlying the options or SARs on the date of grant.
Stock options and SARs cannot be repriced without stockholder approval. Optionees may pay the exercise price in cash or, if approved by
the compensation committee, in shares (valued at their fair market value on the date preceding the date of exercise) or a combination
thereof, or by way of a "cashless exercise" through a broker approved by ANGI Homeservices or by withholding shares otherwise
receivable on exercise.

        The term of a stock option or SAR is as determined by the compensation committee, but a stock option or SAR may not have a term
longer than ten years from the date of grant. The compensation committee determines the vesting and exercise schedule of stock options
and SARs, which the compensation committee may waive or accelerate at any time, and the extent to which they will be exercisable after
the award holder's employment terminates. Generally, unvested stock options and SARs will terminate upon the termination of
employment, and vested stock options and SARs will remain exercisable for one year after the award holder's death, disability, or
retirement and 90 days after the award holder's termination for any other reason. Vested stock options and SARs also terminate upon the
optionee's termination for cause. Stock options and SARs are transferable only by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or
pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order or, in the case of nonqualified stock options or SARs, as otherwise expressly permitted by
the compensation committee, including, if so permitted, pursuant to a transfer to the participant's family members or to a

charitable organization, whether directly or indirectly or by means of a trust or partnership or otherwise.

        Restricted Stock.    The 2017 Plan provides for the award of shares that are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on transferability as
set forth in the 2017 Plan and as may be otherwise determined by the compensation committee. Except for these restrictions and unless
otherwise determined by the compensation committee, upon the grant of a restricted stock award, the recipient will have rights of a
stockholder with respect to the underlying restricted stock, including the right to vote the restricted stock and to receive all dividends and
other distributions paid or made with respect to such restricted stock on such terms as are set forth in the applicable award agreement.
Unless otherwise determined by the compensation committee: (a) cash dividends on the shares that are the subject of the restricted stock
award will be automatically reinvested in additional restricted stock and held subject to the vesting of the underlying restricted stock; and
(b) dividends payable in shares shall be paid in the form of additional restricted stock and held subject to the vesting of the underlying
restricted stock. Restricted stock granted under the 2017 Plan may or may not be subject to performance conditions. During the restriction
period set by the compensation committee, the recipient may not sell, transfer, pledge, exchange, or otherwise encumber the restricted
stock. Generally, all shares of unvested restricted stock shall be forfeited upon the award holder's termination, unless otherwise agreed or
the compensation committee waives such forfeiture.

        RSUs.    The 2017 Plan authorizes the compensation committee to grant restricted stock units ("RSUs"). RSUs are awards
denominated in shares that will be settled, subject to the terms and conditions of the RSUs, in an amount in cash, shares, or both, based
upon the fair market value of a specified number of shares. RSUs are not shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock and do not
entitle the recipients to the rights of a stockholder. The award agreement for RSUs will specify whether, to what extent, and on what terms
and conditions the participant will be entitled to receive current or delayed payments of cash, shares, or other property corresponding to
the dividends payable on the shares. RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan may or may not be subject to performance conditions. The
recipient may not sell, transfer, pledge, or otherwise encumber RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan prior to their vesting. Generally, all
unvested RSUs will be forfeited upon the award holder's termination, unless otherwise agreed or the compensation committee waives such
forfeiture.

        Other Stock-Based Awards.    Other stock-based and other awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise
based on, shares, including unrestricted stock, dividend equivalents, and convertible debentures, may be granted under the 2017 Plan.
Shares covered by the 2017 Plan may be used to satisfy obligations with respect to equity-based awards that correspond to shares of
subsidiaries of ANGI Homeservices.

        Cash-Based Awards.    Cash-based awards may be granted under the 2017 Plan. No participant may be granted cash-based awards
that have an aggregate maximum payment value in any calendar year in excess of $10 million if the awards are intended to qualify as tax-
deductible performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code.

        Performance Goals.    The 2017 Plan provides that performance goals may be established by the compensation committee in
connection with the grant of any award under the 2017 Plan. In the case of an award intended to qualify for the performance-based
compensation exception of Section 162(m) of the Code, such goals will be based on the attainment of specified levels of one or more of
the following measures: specified levels of earnings per share from continuing operations, net profit after tax, EBITDA, EBITA, gross
profit, cash generation, unit volume, market share, sales, asset quality, earnings per share, operating income, revenues, return on assets,
return on operating assets, return on equity, profits, total stockholder return (measured in terms of stock price appreciation and/or dividend
growth), cost saving levels, marketing-spending efficiency, core non-interest income, change in working

capital, return on capital, and/or stock price, with respect to ANGI Homeservices or any subsidiary, affiliate, division or department of
ANGI Homeservices.

        Change in Control.    Unless otherwise provided by the compensation committee in an award agreement or otherwise, in the event
that, during the two-year period following a change in control of ANGI Homeservices, a participant's employment is terminated by ANGI
Homeservices (other than for cause or due to death or disability) or a participant resigns for good reason:

• any stock options and SARs outstanding as of the date of termination of employment that were outstanding as of the date of
the change in control will become fully exercisable and vested and will remain exercisable for the greater of: (a) the period
that they would remain exercisable absent the change in control provision and (b) the lesser of the original term or one year
following such termination of employment; 

• the restrictions applicable to restricted stock awards will lapse, and such restricted stock will become free of all restrictions
and fully vested and transferable; and 

• all RSUs will be considered to be earned and payable in full, any restrictions will lapse and such RSUs will be settled in
cash or shares as promptly as practicable.

        The compensation committee or the ANGI Homeservices board of directors may provide for different treatment in the event of a
change in control, including the vesting of awards upon a change in control.

        Amendment and Discontinuance.    The 2017 Plan may be amended, altered, or discontinued by the ANGI Homeservices board of
directors, but no amendment, alteration, or discontinuance may impair the rights of an optionee under a stock option award or a recipient
of a SAR award, restricted stock award, RSU award, or cash-based award previously granted without the consent of the optionee or
recipient. Amendments to the 2017 Plan will require stockholder approval to the extent such approval is required by law or the listing
standards of the applicable exchange. The 2017 Plan will terminate on the ten-year anniversary of the adoption of the 2017 Plan.

Subsidiary Stock Awards

        IAC has granted equity awards in certain HomeAdvisor Entities to certain employees. For a description of these subsidiary equity
awards, see "Note 8—Stock-Based Compensation" to ANGI Homeservices historical financial statements contained elsewhere in this
proxy statement/prospectus.

        Pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement, these equity awards will vest over a period of years and may be settled, at IAC's
option, in shares of IAC's common stock or in shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock. To the extent shares of IAC common
stock are issued, ANGI Homeservices will reimburse IAC for the cost of these shares by issuing IAC additional shares of ANGI
Homeservices Class B common stock. See the section entitled "Ancillary Agreements—Employee Matters Agreement."

Employment Agreements with William B. Ridenour, Craig Smith and Allison Lowrie

        ANGI Homeservices entered into an employment agreement with each of Messrs. Ridenour and Smith and Ms. Lowrie on August 24,
2017. The employment agreements have a scheduled term ending on December 31, 2019, and provide for automatic renewals for
successive one-year terms absent written notice from ANGI Homeservices or the executive officer 90 days prior to the expiration of the
then-current term.

        The employment agreements provide that the executive officer will be eligible to receive an annual base salary (currently $400,000,
in the case of Messrs. Ridenour and Smith, and $300,000, in the case of

Ms. Lowrie), discretionary annual cash bonuses, and such other employee benefits as may be determined by ANGI Homeservices.

        Upon certain involuntary terminations of the executive officer's employment and subject to his or her execution and non-revocation
of a release of claims in favor of ANGI Homeservices and compliance with the restrictive covenants set forth in the employment
agreement: (i) ANGI Homeservices will continue to pay the executive officer his or her annual base salary for one year following such
termination, and (ii) all ANGI Homeservices or IAC equity awards (including any cliff-vesting awards, which will be prorated as though
such awards had an annual vesting schedule) held by the executive officer that would have otherwise vested during the one-year period
following such termination will vest as of the date of such termination (subject, in the case of performance-based awards, to the
satisfaction of the applicable performance conditions).

        Pursuant to the employment agreements, the executive officers are bound by a covenant not to compete with ANGI Homeservices'
businesses during the term of their employment and for 12 months thereafter, and covenant not to solicit ANGI Homeservices' employees
or business partners during the term of their employment and for 12 months after such a termination. In addition, the executive officers
have agreed not to use or disclose any confidential information of ANGI Homeservices or its affiliates.

        Under the employment agreements, the executive officers may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Class A shares of ANGI
Homeservices acquired upon exercise or settlement of ANGI Homeservices equity awards prior to December 31, 2019. This restriction
will lapse upon a termination of the executive officer's employment by ANGI Homeservices without cause, by the executive officer with
good reason, or due to the executive officer's death. Following the consummation of the Transactions, the applicable annual limits on the
number of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices with respect to which Messrs. Ridenour or Smith may exercise stock appreciation rights
will remain in effect (as equitably adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio).

        The employment agreements with each of Messrs. Ridenour and Smith and Ms. Lowrie will become effective subject to, and upon
the consummation of, the Transactions.

2016 Option Exercises and Stock Vested

        The table below provides information regarding the number of shares acquired by the named executive officers upon the exercise of
stock options and/or HA SARs in 2016 and the related value realized, excluding the effect of any applicable taxes. The dollar value
realized upon the exercise of stock options or HA SARs represents the difference between the fair market value of the shares acquired
upon exercise and the exercise price of the stock options or HA SARs, multiplied by the number of awards exercised.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control

        Certain employment agreements, compensation plans, and equity award agreements entitle one or more of the named executive
officers to continued base salary payments, the acceleration of the vesting of equity awards, and/or extended post-termination exercise
periods for stock options upon certain terminations of employment (including certain terminations during specified periods following a
change in control). These arrangements are described below as they would have applied to each named executive officer on December 31,
2016.

        As noted above, ANGI Homeservices entered into employment agreements with each of Messrs. Ridenour and Smith and Ms. Lowrie
on August 24, 2017, which will become effective subject to, and upon the consummation of, the Transactions. These employment
agreements are described in "—ANGI Homeservices Compensation Program Following the Transactions—Employment Agreements with

Messrs. Terrill and Smith

        Upon a termination without cause or resignation for good reason on December 31, 2016, pursuant to the terms of an employment
agreement with HomeAdvisor (US) then in effect, each of Messrs. Terrill and Smith would have been entitled to receive 12 months of his
base salary (and in the case of Mr. Smith, reimbursement for COBRA payments during the 12-month period), subject to the execution and
non-revocation of a release of claims and compliance with post-termination confidentiality, noncompetition (12 months), nonsolicitation of
employees (18 months), nonsolicitation of business partners (18 months), and assignment of certain employee developments covenants,
and subject to offset for any amounts earned from other employment during the severance period.

        No payments would have been made to Messrs. Terrill or Smith upon a change in control of IAC or any of its subsidiaries on
December 31, 2016. However, upon a termination without cause or resignation for good reason on December 31, 2016 that occurred
during the two-year period following a change in control of the issuer of the award (i.e., IAC, HomeAdvisor (US), or HomeAdvisor
(International)), in accordance with the applicable compensation plans and the related equity award agreements, the vesting of all then
outstanding and unvested stock awards held by Messrs. Terrill and Smith that were issued by such issuer would have been accelerated.

Mr. Ridenour and Ms. Lowrie

        No payments would have been made to Mr. Ridenour or Ms. Lowrie pursuant to any agreement between any HomeAdvisor Entity
and these named executive officers (i) upon a termination without cause or due to death or disability or a resignation for good reason on
December 31, 2016 or (ii) upon a change in control of any of HomeAdvisor (US), HomeAdvisor (International), or IAC on December 31,
2016. However, upon a termination without cause or resignation for good reason on December 31, 2016 that occurred during the two-year
period following a change in control of the issuer of the award (i.e., IAC, HomeAdvisor (US), or HomeAdvisor (International)), in
accordance with the applicable compensation plans and the related equity award agreements, the vesting of all then outstanding and
unvested stock awards held by Mr. Ridenour and Ms. Lowrie that were issued by such issuer would have been accelerated.

Mr. Schiffman

        Upon a termination without cause or resignation for good reason on December 31, 2016, pursuant to the terms of his employment
agreement with IAC, Mr. Schiffman would have been entitled to:

• receive 12 months of his base salary, subject to the execution and non-revocation of a release of claims and compliance
with post-termination confidentiality, noncompetition (12 months), nonsolicitation of employees (18 months),
nonsolicitation of business partners (18 months), and assignment of certain employee developments covenants, and subject
to offset for any amounts earned from other employment during the severance period; 

• the vesting of all outstanding and unvested stock options granted to him in 2016; 

• the partial vesting of outstanding and unvested stock options and/or restricted stock units (as applicable) granted after 2016
(including cliff vesting awards, which would be prorated as though such awards had an annual vesting schedule) in
amounts equal to the number that would have otherwise vested in accordance with the terms of such awards during the 12-
month period following such termination of employment; and 

• continue to have the ability to exercise his vested stock options through June 30, 2018.

        No payments would have been made to Mr. Schiffman pursuant to any agreement between IAC and Mr. Schiffman upon a change in
control of IAC or any of its subsidiaries on December 31, 2016.

Upon a termination without cause or resignation for good reason on December 31, 2016 that occurred during the two-year period
following a change in control of IAC, in accordance with IAC's omnibus stock and annual incentive plans and the related award
agreements, the vesting of all then outstanding and unvested stock options held by Mr. Schiffman would have been accelerated.

Estimated Potential Incremental Payments to Executives Upon Termination or Change in Control

        The table below describes and quantifies certain amounts that would have become payable to the named executive officers upon
certain terminations of employment or change in control events, assuming that the relevant event occurred on December 31, 2016. These
amounts, which exclude the effect of any applicable taxes, are based on:

• the named executive's base salary as of December 31, 2016; 

• the number of equity awards held by an executive on December 31, 2016; and 

• the fair market value of a common share of HomeAdvisor (US) ($16.83) and the closing price of IAC common stock
($64.79) on December 30, 2016. As the value of HomeAdvisor (International) has not increased since the date awards were
granted in early 2016, no incremental payments relating to HomeAdvisor (International) awards would have been made
upon any termination of employment or change in control.

ANGI HOMESERVICES DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 

        Following the completion of the Transactions, the ANGI Homeservices board of directors will have primary responsibility for
establishing non-employee director compensation arrangements, which will be designed to provide competitive compensation necessary to
attract and retain high quality non-employee directors and to encourage ownership of ANGI Homeservices common stock to further align
the interests of non-employee directors with those of ANGI Homeservices stockholders.

        Each non-employee director will receive an annual retainer in the amount of $50,000, each member of the audit committee and the
compensation committee (including their respective chairs) will receive an additional annual retainer in the amount of $10,000 and $5,000,
respectively, and the chair of each of the audit committee and the compensation committee will receive an additional annual chairperson
retainer in the amount of $20,000.

        In addition to the annual retainers described above, each non-employee director will receive a grant of restricted stock units
corresponding to shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock with a dollar value of $250,000 upon his or her initial election to
the ANGI Homeservices board of directors and annually thereafter upon re-election on the date of the ANGI Homeservices annual
meeting of stockholders. The terms of these restricted stock units provide for (i) vesting in three equal annual installments commencing on
the first anniversary of the grant date, (ii) cancellation and forfeiture of unvested units in their entirety upon termination of service with the
ANGI Homeservices board of directors, and (iii) full acceleration of vesting upon a change in control of ANGI Homeservices. Non-
employee directors are also reimbursed for all reasonable expenses incurred in connection with attendance at ANGI Homeservices board
of directors and committee meetings.

        For purposes of these compensation arrangements, non-employee directors are those directors who are not employed by (or otherwise
providing services to) ANGI Homeservices or IAC (or any of its subsidiaries).

DESCRIPTION OF ANGI HOMESERVICES CAPITAL STOCK 

        The following section contains a summary of the ANGI Homeservices common stock and certain provisions of the amended and
restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of ANGI Homeservices that will be in effect upon the completion of
the Transactions. This summary does not purport to be complete, may not contain all the information that is important to you and is
qualified in its entirety by (i) the full text of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, the
forms of which are attached as Annex C and Annex D, respectively, and (ii) the applicable provisions of Delaware law.

Authorized Capital Stock

        Upon the completion of the Transactions, ANGI Homeservices' amended and restated certificate of incorporation will authorize it to
issue up to 5,500,000,000 shares of stock, comprised of 2,000,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value Class A common stock, 1,500,000,000
shares of $0.001 par value Class B common stock, 1,500,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value Class C common stock, and 500,000,000
shares of $0.001 par value preferred stock. Immediately following the completion of the Transactions, ANGI Homeservices is expected to
have approximately 60.5 million Class A shares outstanding and 413.2 million Class B shares outstanding, assuming that all Angie's List
stockholders receive the Share Consideration in the Merger. For more information on these calculations, see the section entitled "The
Merger Agreement—Determination of the Number of Class B Shares of ANGI Homeservices to Be Issued to IAC." There will be no
shares of Class C common stock or preferred stock outstanding immediately following the completion of the Transactions. The number of
authorized shares of any class of stock of ANGI Homeservices may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof
then outstanding) by the vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all then-outstanding Class A shares, Class B shares and
any outstanding series of preferred stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as one class.

Types of Capital Stock

Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class C Common Stock

        The rights of holders of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock will be identical, except for the
differences described below under "—Voting Rights," "—Dividend Rights" and "—Conversion Rights." Any authorized but unissued
shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock will be available for issuance by the ANGI
Homeservices board of directors without any further stockholder action, subject to any limitations imposed by NASDAQ Rules.

        Voting Rights.    Holders of Class A common stock will be entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by
stockholders. Holders of Class B common stock will be entitled to ten votes per share on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders.
Holders of Class C common stock will not be entitled to any votes per share (except as, and then only to the extent, otherwise required by
the laws of Delaware, in which case holders of Class C common stock will be entitled to one one-hundredth of a vote per share). None of
the holders of Class A common stock, Class B common stock or Class C common stock will have cumulative voting rights in the election
of directors.

        Dividend Rights.    Holders of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock will be entitled to ratably
receive dividends (other than in the event of a share distribution or an asset distribution, as further described below) if, as and when
declared from time to time by the ANGI Homeservices board of directors in its discretion out of funds legally available for that purpose,
after payment of any dividends required to be paid on any outstanding preferred stock. Under Delaware law, ANGI Homeservices can only
pay dividends either out of "surplus" or out of the current or the immediately preceding year's net profits. Surplus is defined as the excess,
if any, at any given time, of

the total assets of a corporation over its total liabilities and statutory capital. The value of a corporation's assets can be measured in a
number of ways and may not necessarily equal their book value.

        In a distribution of shares of ANGI Homeservices' common stock, ANGI Homeservices may distribute (i) shares of Class C common
stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Class C common stock), on an equal per share basis, to
holders of Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock or (ii) (x) shares of Class A common stock (or
securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Class A common stock), on an equal per share basis, to holders of
Class A common stock; (y) shares of Class B stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Class B
common stock), on an equal per share basis, to holders of Class B common stock; and (z) shares of Class C common stock (or securities
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Class C common stock), on an equal per share basis, to holders of Class C
common stock.

        In a distribution of any other securities of ANGI Homeservices or the capital stock or other securities of another person or entity,
ANGI Homeservices may choose to distribute: (i) identical securities, on an equal per share basis, to holders of Class A common stock,
Class B common stock and Class C common stock, (ii) a separate class or series of securities to holders of shares of Class A common
stock, a separate class of securities to holders of shares of Class B common stock and a separate class or series of securities to holders of
shares of Class C common stock, on an equal per share basis, (iii) a separate class or series of securities to holders of shares of Class B
common stock and a different class or series of securities to holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class C common stock, on an
equal per share basis or (iv) a separate class or series of securities to holders of shares of Class C common stock and a different class or
series of securities to holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, on an equal per share basis, provided that, in
the case of clause (ii), (iii) or (iv), the different classes or series of securities to be distributed are not different in any respect other than
their relative voting rights (and any related differences in designation, conversion, redemption and share distribution provisions, as
applicable), with either (x) holders of shares of Class B common stock receiving the class or series of securities having the highest relative
voting rights or (y) holders of shares of Class B common stock and Class A common stock receiving a class or series of securities having
the highest relative voting rights. A dividend involving a class or series of securities of another person or entity may be treated as a share
distribution or as an asset distribution as determined by the ANGI Homeservices board of directors.

        In a distribution of assets owned by ANGI Homeservices (including shares of any class or series of capital stock of another person or
entity owned by ANGI Homeservices) to holders of any class or classes of common stock, a dividend in cash and/or other property will be
paid to holders of each other class of common stock then outstanding on an equal per share basis in an amount, in the case of a dividend
consisting solely of cash, equal to the fair market value of such holders' ownership interest in the assets paid as a dividend pursuant to the
asset distribution, or having a fair market value, in the case of any other dividend, equal to the fair market value of such holders' ownership
interest in assets paid as a dividend pursuant to the asset distribution.

        The ANGI Homeservices board of directors will have the power and authority to, in good faith, make all determinations regarding,
among other things, (i) whether or not a dividend is an equal dividend per share or is declared and paid on an equal per share basis,
(ii) whether one or more classes or series of securities differ in any respect other than their relative voting rights and (iii) any other
interpretations that may be required under the dividend rights provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation described
above.

        Conversion Rights.    Class B shares will be convertible into Class A shares at the option of the holder at any time on a share for share
basis. The conversion ratio will in all events be equitably

preserved in the event of any recapitalization of ANGI Homeservices by means of a stock dividend on, or a stock split or combination of,
the outstanding Class A shares or Class B shares, or in the event of any merger, consolidation or other reorganization of ANGI
Homeservices with another corporation. Upon the conversion of a Class B share into a Class A share, the applicable Class B share will be
retired and will not be subject to reissue. Class A shares and Class C shares will have no conversion rights.

        Liquidation Rights.    Upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of ANGI Homeservices, holders of Class A common stock,
Class B common stock and Class C common stock are entitled to receive ratably the assets available for distribution to the stockholders
after the rights of holders of shares of preferred stock have been satisfied.

        Other Matters.    The Class A common stock, Class B common stock and Class C common stock will have no preemptive rights
pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of ANGI Homeservices.
There will be no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Class A common stock, Class B common stock or Class C
common stock. All outstanding shares of Class B common stock will be fully paid and non-assessable, and the shares of Class A common
stock to be issued in the Merger, when issued in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, will be fully paid and non-
assessable.

Preferred Stock

        Pursuant to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of ANGI Homeservices, shares of preferred stock will be issuable
from time to time, in one or more series, with the designations of the series, the voting rights of the shares of the series (if any), the
powers, preferences and relative, participation, optional or other special rights (if any), and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions
thereof as the ANGI Homeservices board of directors from time to time may adopt by resolution (and without further stockholder
approval, subject to any limitation imposed by NASDAQ Rules). The rights, preferences and privileges of such preferred stock may be
greater than, and may adversely affect, the rights of ANGI Homeservices' common stock. Each series will consist of that number of shares
as will be stated and expressed in the certificate of designations providing for the issuance of the preferred stock of the series.

Anti-Takeover Effects of Certain Provisions of the DGCL and the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
Amended and Restated Bylaws of ANGI Homeservices

        Certain provisions of the DGCL and certain provisions that will be included in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation
and amended and restated bylaws of ANGI Homeservices summarized below may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may
delay, deter or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder of ANGI Homeservices might consider to be in such
stockholder's best interests, including attempts that might result in a premium being paid over the market price for the shares held by
ANGI Homeservices stockholders.

Preferred Stock

        Under the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation of a corporation may give the board of directors the right to issue new classes of
preferred stock with voting, conversion, dividend distribution and other rights to be determined by the board at the time of issuance. The
amended and restated certificate of incorporation of ANGI Homeservices will give the board of directors this right.

Multi-Class Structure

        As discussed above, Class B common stock has ten votes per share, while Class A common stock, which is the class of stock that
ANGI Homeservices is issuing in connection with the Merger and which

as of the Closing will be the only class of stock which is publicly traded, has one vote per share. Except as provided in the amended and
restated certificate of incorporation of ANGI Homeservices or by the DGCL, the holders of Class A shares and the holders of Class B
shares will vote on all matters (including the election of directors) together as one class. ANGI Homeservices Class C common stock, of
which no shares will be outstanding immediately following the completion of the Transactions, will not have any voting rights.
Immediately following the Merger, IAC will own and control all of the outstanding Class B shares, which at that time will constitute a
substantial majority of both the total voting power and the total number of shares of ANGI Homeservices capital stock then outstanding.
For further details, see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Determination of the Number of Class B Shares of ANGI
Homeservices to Be Issued to IAC." Even if IAC in the future owns significantly less than 50% of ANGI Homeservices' total outstanding
capital stock, because of the multi-class structure of ANGI Homeservices common stock and the higher relative voting rights of Class B
shares compared to Class A shares, IAC will be able to control all matters in which the Class A common stock and the Class B common
stock vote together as one class that are submitted to ANGI Homeservices stockholders for approval. This concentrated control could
discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as
beneficial.

Director Vacancies

        The DGCL provides that vacancies and newly created directorships may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office (even
though less than a quorum) or by a sole remaining director unless (i) otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
corporation or (ii) the certificate of incorporation directs that a particular class of stock is to elect such director, in which case a majority of
the other directors elected by such class, or a sole remaining director elected by such class, will fill such vacancy.

        The amended and restated bylaws of ANGI Homeservices will provide that vacancies and newly created directorships may be filled
by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors elected by the stockholders who vote on such directorship (even if less than a quorum)
or the vote or written consent of a majority of the voting power of the shares of ANGI Homeservices stock issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote on such directorship (subject to the provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement concerning two ANGI-Designated
Directors, as further described in the section entitled "Ancillary Agreements—Investor Rights Agreement").

No Cumulative Voting

        Under the DGCL, cumulative voting for elections of directors is not permitted unless the corporation's certificate of incorporation
specifically provides for it. The amended and restated certificate of incorporation of ANGI Homeservices will not provide for cumulative
voting.

Special Meetings of Stockholders

        Under the DGCL, a special meeting of stockholders may be called by the board of directors or by such other persons as may be
authorized in the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of the corporation.

        The amended and restated bylaws of ANGI Homeservices will provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called by the
chairman of the board of directors of ANGI Homeservices or by a majority of ANGI Homeservices directors. The ANGI Homeservices
stockholders, however, may not call for a special meeting of the stockholders.

Amending the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws of ANGI Homeservices

        Under the DGCL, a certificate of incorporation may be amended if: (i) the board of directors adopts a resolution setting forth the
proposed amendment, declares the advisability of the amendment and directs that it be submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders
(except that, unless required by the certificate of incorporation, no meeting or vote of stockholders is required to adopt an amendment for
certain specified changes); and (ii) the holders of a majority of shares of stock entitled to vote on the matter approve the amendment,
unless the certificate of incorporation requires the vote of a greater number of shares. If a class vote on the amendment is required by the
DGCL, or by the certificate of incorporation, approval by a majority of the outstanding shares of stock of the class is required, unless a
greater proportion is specified in the certificate of incorporation or by other provisions of the DGCL. The amended and restated certificate
of incorporation of ANGI Homeservices will provide that ANGI Homeservices reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in the certificate of incorporation, as prescribed by the DGCL.

        Under the DGCL, the board of directors may adopt, amend or repeal a corporation's bylaws if so authorized in the certificate of
incorporation. The stockholders of a Delaware corporation also have the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.

        The amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of ANGI Homeservices will allow the board
of directors to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws by the vote of a majority of all directors. Under the Investor Rights Agreement, however,
up until the date on which the 2020 annual meeting of ANGI Homeservices stockholders is held, IAC will agree not to vote in favor of any
amendments to the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of ANGI Homeservices that would be inconsistent with certain provisions of the
Investor Rights Agreement and would adversely affect the rights of holders of Class A Shares, other than as may be approved by the audit
committee of the ANGI Homeservices board of directors and a majority of the holders of Class A shares.

Authorized but Unissued Shares

        Delaware companies are permitted to authorize shares that may be issued in the future. Following the completion of the Transactions,
a substantial number of unissued shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock, Class B common stock, Class C common stock
and preferred stock will be available for future issuances by the ANGI Homeservices board of directors without stockholder approval,
subject to any limitations imposed by NASDAQ Rules. Issuances of these shares could be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes,
including future offerings to raise additional capital, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of any authorized but unissued
and unreserved Class A common stock, Class B common stock, Class C common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or
discourage an attempt to obtain control of ANGI Homeservices by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.

Exclusive Jurisdiction

        The amended and restated bylaws of ANGI Homeservices will provide that a state court located within Delaware, or if no state court
located within Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware, will be the exclusive forum for all of the
following: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of ANGI Homeservices, (ii) any action asserting a claim for or based
on breach of fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director or officer or other employee of ANGI Homeservices to ANGI
Homeservices or to its stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against ANGI Homeservices or any of its current or former directors,
officers, or other employees pursuant to the DGCL, its certificate of incorporation, or its bylaws, (iv) any action asserting a claim

relating to or involving ANGI Homeservices that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, or (v) any action asserting an "internal
corporate claim," as defined under the DGCL.

Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers

        Under the DGCL, subject to specified limitations in the case of derivative suits brought by a corporation's stockholders in its name, a
corporation may indemnify any person who is made or is threatened to be made a party to any action, suit or proceeding on account of
being a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation (or was serving at the request of the corporation in such capacity for another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts
paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the action, suit or proceeding, provided that there is a
determination that: (i) the individual acted in good faith and in a manner the individual reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the corporation; and (ii) in a criminal action or proceeding, the individual had no reasonable cause to believe his or her
conduct was unlawful. Without court approval, however, no indemnification may be made in respect of any derivative action in which an
individual is adjudged liable to the corporation, except to the extent the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or
suit was brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is
fairly and reasonably entitled to be indemnified.

        The DGCL requires indemnification of directors and officers for expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably relating
to a successful defense on the merits or otherwise of a derivative or third-party action.

        Under the DGCL, a corporation may advance expenses relating to the defense of any proceeding to directors and officers upon the
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the individual to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to be indemnified.

        The DGCL permits the adoption of a provision in a corporation's certificate of incorporation limiting or eliminating the monetary
liability of a director to a corporation or its stockholders by reason of a director's breach of the fiduciary duty of care. The DGCL does not
permit any limitation of the liability of a director for: (i) breaching the duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; (ii) acts or
omissions not in good faith; (iii) engaging in intentional misconduct or a known violation of law; (iv) obtaining an improper personal
benefit from a transaction; or (v) paying a dividend or approving a stock repurchase or redemption that was illegal under applicable law.

        The amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of ANGI Homeservices will provide for
limitations on liability of its directors and the indemnification of its directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL.

Waiver of Corporate Opportunity for IAC and Officers and Directors of IAC

        The DGCL permits the adoption of a provision in a corporation's certificate of incorporation renouncing any interests or expectancy
of a corporation in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, specified business opportunities or specified classes or categories
of business opportunities that are presented to the corporation or one or more of its officers, directors or stockholders.

        The amended and restated certificate of incorporation of ANGI Homeservices will include a "corporate opportunity" provision that
renounces any interests or expectancy of ANGI Homeservices or its subsidiaries (i) to participate in any business of IAC or (ii) in any
potential transaction or matter that may constitute a corporate opportunity for both (a) IAC and (b) ANGI Homeservices or its subsidiaries.
Under this provision, ANGI Homeservices further recognizes that (1) any of its directors

or officers who are also officers, directors, employees or other affiliates of IAC or its affiliates (except that ANGI Homeservices and its
subsidiaries will not be deemed affiliates of IAC or its affiliates for the purposes of this provision) and (2) IAC itself will have no duty to
offer or communicate information regarding such a corporate opportunity. The provision generally will provide that neither IAC nor
officers or directors of ANGI Homeservices who are also officers or directors of IAC or its affiliates will be liable to ANGI Homeservices
or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of (i) such person's participation in any business on behalf of IAC or (ii) the
fact that any such person pursues or acquires any corporate opportunity for the account of IAC or its affiliates, directs or transfers such
corporate opportunity to IAC or its affiliates, or does not communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to ANGI
Homeservices. This renunciation will not extend to corporate opportunities expressly offered to one of the officers or directors of ANGI
Homeservices solely in his or her capacity as an officer or director of ANGI Homeservices.

Listing and Trading

        ANGI Homeservices common stock is currently not listed on any securities exchange. It is currently expected that following the
completion of the Transactions, Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices will trade on NASDAQ under the symbol "ANGI," which is the
current ticker symbol for Angie's List.

Transfer Agent and Registrar

        Upon completion of the Transactions, the transfer agent and registrar for ANGI Homeservices common stock will be Computershare

COMPARISON OF THE RIGHTS OF ANGIE'S LIST STOCKHOLDERS
AND HOLDERS OF CLASS A SHARES OF ANGI HOMESERVICES 

        If the Merger is consummated, stockholders of Angie's List who receive the Share Consideration in the Merger will become holders of
Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices. Angie's List and ANGI Homeservices are both organized under the laws of Delaware. However,
differences in the rights of holders of Angie's List common stock and holders of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices will arise due to
differences between their respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws. As holders of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices, your
rights with respect thereto will continue to be governed by Delaware law, including the DGCL, as well as the amended and restated
certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of ANGI Homeservices. This section summarizes all of the material
differences between the rights of Angie's List stockholders and holders of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices.

        The following summary is not a complete statement of the rights of the stockholders of either of the two companies or a complete
description of the specific provisions referred to below. The identification of specific differences is not intended to indicate that other
equally significant or more significant differences do not exist. Angie's List has filed with the SEC its constituent documents and will send
copies of these documents to you, without charge, upon your request, which you are urged to read carefully. The forms of the amended and
restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of ANGI Homeservices that will be in effect upon the completion of
the Transactions are attached to this proxy statement/prospectus as Annex C and Annex D, respectively. For additional information, please

List (the "Angie's List Charter"), the amended and restated bylaws
of Angie's List (the "Angie's List Bylaws") and Delaware law,

and Class B common stock, on an equal per share basis, provided
that, in the case of clause (ii), (iii) or (iv), the different classes or
series of securities to be distributed are not different in any respect
other than their relative voting rights (and any related differences
in designation, conversion, redemption and share distribution
provisions, as applicable), with either (x) holders of shares of
Class B common stock receiving the class or series of securities
having the highest relative voting rights or (y) holders of shares of
Class B common stock and Class A common stock receiving a
class or series of securities having the highest relative voting
rights. A dividend involving a class or series of securities of
another person or entity may be treated as a share distribution or
as an asset distribution as determined by the ANGI Homeservices
board of directors.

ANGI Homeservices  Angie's List
The ANGI Homeservices Bylaws do not provide for classes of
directors. The board of directors of ANGI Homeservices will be
elected annually. Pursuant to the ANGI Homeservices Bylaws,
each director will serve for a term of one year from the date of his
or her election and until his or her successor is elected or until his
or her earlier resignation, removal or death. The ANGI
Homeservices Bylaws provide that, at all meetings of the
stockholders at which directors are to be elected, election of
directors will be by ballot and, subject to the rights of the holders
of shares of preferred stock to elect directors under specified
circumstances, a plurality of the votes cast will elect each director.

Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, until and excluding
the ANGI Homeservices annual meeting of stockholders to be
held in 2020, the two ANGI-Designated Directors, including any
successor(s) to the initial ANGI-Designated Directors, will, if able
and willing, continue to serve on the board of directors of ANGI
Homeservices. IAC will agree to vote its shares of ANGI
Homeservices common stock in favor of the ANGI-Designated
Directors at any meeting at which any of them stand for election.
For additional information, see the section entitled "Ancillary
Agreements—Investor Rights Agreement."

 The Angie's List Charter and Bylaws provide that the directors are
divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and
Class III. The Angie's List Bylaws provide that each class must
consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total
number of directors constituting the entire board of directors.
Pursuant to the Angie's List Charter and Bylaws, each director
serves for a term ending on the date of the third annual meeting of
stockholders next following the annual meeting at which such
director was elected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each director
will hold office until such director's successor has been duly
elected and qualified or until such director's earlier death,
resignation or removal.

The Angie's List Charter provides that election of directors need
not be by written ballot unless the Angie's List Bylaws so provide.
The Angie's List Bylaws do not require written ballots for the
election of directors. The Angie's List Bylaws provide that,
subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock
to elect additional directors under specific circumstances,
directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares of
capital stock of Angie's List present in person or represented by
proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of
directors.

Removal of Directors

The ANGI Homeservices Bylaws provide that any director or the
entire board of directors may at any time be removed effective
immediately, with or without cause, by a majority of the voting
power of shares of stock issued and outstanding of the class or
classes that elected such director.

 The Angie's List Charter and Bylaws provide that no director may
be removed from office by the stockholders except for cause with
the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a majority of
the total voting power of all outstanding securities then entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a
single class.

Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, IAC will agree not to
vote to remove any ANGI-Designated Director, other than for
cause. For additional information, see the section entitled
"Ancillary Agreements—Investor Rights Agreement."

Vacancies on the Board of Directors

The ANGI Homeservices Bylaws provide that vacancies and
newly created directorships may be filled by the vote of a majority
of the remaining directors elected by the stockholders who vote on
such directorship, though less than a quorum, or a majority of the
voting power of shares of such stock issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote on such directorship. The directors so chosen will
hold office until the next annual election and until their respective
successors are duly elected or until their earlier resignation,
removal or death.

If, prior to the annual meeting of ANGI Homeservices
stockholders in 2020, any ANGI-Designated Director becomes
unwilling or unable to serve, the ANGI Homeservices board of
directors will select a replacement. Any individual selected as a
replacement must be (i) "independent" pursuant to NASDAQ
Rules and the Exchange Act, if the director to be replaced was
also "independent," (ii) qualified to serve as an "independent"
director of IAC (were such individual to be appointed) and
(iii) acceptable to the remaining ANGI-Designated Director then
serving on the ANGI Homeservices board of directors. For
additional information, see the section entitled "Ancillary
Agreements—Investor Rights Agreement."

 The Angie's List Charter provides that vacancies on the board of
directors resulting from death, resignation, removal or otherwise
and newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the
number of directors will, except as otherwise provided by law, be
filled solely by a majority of the directors then in office (although
less than a quorum) or by the sole remaining director. Each
director so elected will hold office for a term that coincides with
the term of the Class to which such director has been elected.

In addition, the Angie's List Bylaws provide that (i) if there are no
directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in
accordance with the DGCL, and (ii) unless otherwise provided in
the Angie's List Charter, when one or more directors resigns from
the board of directors, effective at a future date, a majority of the
directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, will
have the power to fill such vacancy or vacancies and each director
so chosen will hold office as provided in the filling of the other
vacancies.

Stockholder Action by Written Consent

The ANGI Homeservices Bylaws provide that any action required
or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice
and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action
so taken, is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not
less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Prompt notice of
such action must be given to those stockholders who have not
consented in writing.

 The Angie's List Charter provides that any action required or
permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders may be taken only upon the vote of stockholders at
an annual or special meeting duly noticed and called in
accordance with the DGCL and the Angie's List Charter and may
not be taken by written consent of stockholders without a meeting.
The Angie's List Bylaws similarly provide that, subject to the
rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock then
outstanding, as may be set forth in the certificate of designation
relating to such preferred stock, any action required or permitted
to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders may
be taken only upon the vote of stockholders at an annual or special
meeting duly noticed and called in accordance with the DGCL
and may not be taken by written consent of stockholders without a
meeting.

Quorum

The ANGI Homeservices Bylaws provide that, except as
otherwise provided by law, the holders of shares representing a
majority of the voting power of ANGI Homeservices entitled to
vote, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a
quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of
business. However, where a separate vote by a class or series or
classes or series is required, a majority of the outstanding shares
of such class or series or classes will constitute a quorum with
respect to such vote.

 The Angie's List Bylaws provide that, unless otherwise provided
under the Angie's List Charter or Bylaws and subject to the
DGCL, the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding capital stock of Angie's List entitled to
vote at a meeting of stockholders will constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business.

by the board of directors or by such other persons as may be
authorized in the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws of the
corporation.

 Under the DGCL, a special meeting of stockholders may be called
by the board of directors or by such other persons as may be

the stockholders may be called by the chairman of the board of
directors of ANGI Homeservices or by a majority of ANGI
Homeservices directors. The ANGI Homeservices stockholders,

meetings of the stockholders may be called by the board of
directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of
the total number of authorized directors, the chairman of the board
of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or the
secretary of Angie's List and may not be called by any other

notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever holders of one or more
classes or series of preferred stock will have the right, voting
separately as a class or series, to elect directors, such holders may
call, pursuant to the terms of the resolutions applicable thereto
adopted by the board of directors, special meetings of holders of
such preferred stock.

Notice of Stockholder Meetings

The ANGI Homeservices Bylaws provide that, for stockholder
meetings, written notice stating the date, time and place, if any, of
such meeting, the means of remote communication, if any, by
which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be
present in person and vote at such meeting, and in case of a
special meeting, the purpose or purposes thereof, will be given to
each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting not less than 10
nor more than 60 days prior to the meeting, either personally or by
mail, facsimile, telegraph or other means of electronic
communication.

Meetings may be held without notice if all stockholders entitled to
vote are present (unless any such stockholders are present for the
purpose of objecting to the meeting as lawfully called or
convened), or if notice is waived by those not present. Any
previously scheduled meeting of the stockholders may be
postponed, and any special meeting of the stockholders may be
canceled, by resolution of the board of directors upon public
notice given prior to the time previously scheduled for such
meeting of stockholders.

 The Angie's List Bylaws provide that, whenever stockholders are
required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written
notice of the meeting will be given which states the place, if any,
date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote
communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders
may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting,
and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for
which the meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by the
DGCL, such notice will be given not less than 10 nor more than
60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder of
record entitled to vote at such meeting.

A written waiver of any such notice signed by the person entitled
thereto, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person
entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein,
will be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a
stockholder meeting will constitute a waiver of notice of such
meeting, except when the person attends the meeting for the
express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to
the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened.

Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Nominations and Other Provisions

The ANGI Homeservices Charter and Bylaws do not provide for
procedures with respect to stockholder proposals or director
nominations.

 Annual meetings:

The Angie's List Bylaws provide that nominations of persons for
election to the board of directors or the proposal of other business
to be transacted by the stockholders at an annual meeting of
stockholders may be made only (i) pursuant to Angie's List's
notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto), (ii) by or at the
direction of the board of directors or any committee thereof or
(iii) by any stockholder who is a stockholder of record at the time
such stockholder gives notice and at the time of the annual
meeting and who is entitled to vote at the meeting and complies
with the notice procedures set forth in the Angie's List Bylaws.

Amendment of Charter
Under the DGCL, a certificate of incorporation may be amended
if: (i) the board of directors adopts a resolution setting forth the
proposed amendment, declares the advisability of the amendment
and directs that it be submitted to a vote at a meeting of
stockholders (except that unless required by the certificate of

separately as a class on an amendment to the corporation's
certificate of incorporation, even if the certificate does not provide
such a right, if the amendment would:

of such class (unless the certificate of incorporation adopted
prior to the issuance of any shares of such class of stock, or as
amended with the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of such class, permits such increase or decrease by only an
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of stock entitled to
vote, as permitted under the ANGI Homeservices Charter, as
further described below);

• increase or decrease the par value of the shares of the class; or

• change the powers, preferences or special rights of the shares of
such class so as to affect them adversely.

If the powers, preferences or special rights of one or more
series of a class but not the entire class are affected, only the
shares of such series that would be affected will be considered a
class for the purposes of such voting.

ANGI Homeservices  Angie's List
The ANGI Homeservices Charter may be amended in accordance
with the DGCL. The ANGI Homeservices Charter specifically
provides that the number of authorized shares of any class of stock
may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of
shares of such class then outstanding) by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority of the voting power of Class A common
stock, Class B common stock and any one or more series of
preferred stock entitled to vote on the matter, voting together as
one class.

Under the Investor Rights Agreement, however, up until the date
on which the 2020 annual meeting of ANGI Homeservices
stockholders is held, IAC will agree not to vote in favor of any
amendments to the ANGI Homeservices Charter or the ANGI
Homeservices Bylaws that would be inconsistent with certain
provisions of the Investor Rights Agreement and would adversely
affect the rights of holders of ANGI Homeservices Class A
common stock other than as may be approved by the audit
committee of the ANGI Homeservices board of directors and a
majority of the holders of ANGI Homeservices Class A common
stock. See the section entitled "Ancillary Agreements—Investor
Rights Agreement."

 Under the DGCL, if a corporation's certificate of incorporation
requires the vote of a greater number or proportion than required
under the DGCL for action by the board of directors, by the
holders of any class or series of shares or by the holders of any
other securities having voting power, the provision of the
certificate of incorporation requiring such greater vote will not be
altered, amended or repealed except by such greater vote.

The Angie's List Charter provides that Angie's List reserves the
right to amend the Angie's List Charter in any manner permitted
by the DGCL and all rights and powers conferred upon
stockholders, directors and officers therein are granted subject to
this reservation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions set
forth in the following articles of the Angie's List Charter may not
be repealed or amended in any respect, and no other provision
may be adopted, amended or repealed which would have the
effect of modifying or permitting the circumvention of such
provisions, unless such action is approved by the affirmative vote
of the holders of not less than 662/3% of the total voting power of
all outstanding securities of Angie's List then entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class:

• Article IV (Capital Stock);
 

• Article V (Bylaws);

Amendment of Bylaws

Under the DGCL, the stockholders entitled to vote have the power
to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws. In addition, a corporation may,
in its certificate of incorporation, confer such power upon the
directors, but such conferral does not divest the stockholders of
their power to adopt, amend or repeal the bylaws.

Limitation on Director Liability

The DGCL permits the adoption of a provision in a corporation's
certificate of incorporation limiting or eliminating the monetary
liability of a director to a corporation or its stockholders by reason
of a director's breach of the fiduciary duty of care. The DGCL
does not permit any limitation of the liability of a director for:
(i) breaching the duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
stockholders; (ii) acts or omissions not in good faith;
(iii) engaging in intentional misconduct or a known violation of
law; (iv) obtaining an improper personal benefit from a
transaction; or (v) paying a dividend or approving a stock

limited to the full extent permitted by the DGCL, as it may be
amended in the future.

any potential transaction or matter that may constitute a corporate
opportunity for both (a) IAC and (b) ANGI Homeservices or its

will not be deemed affiliates of IAC or its affiliates for the
purposes of this provision) and (2) IAC itself will have no duty to

HISTORICAL MARKET PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION REGARDING
ANGIE'S LIST COMMON STOCK 

        Angie's List common stock has been listed on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol "ANGI" since its initial public offering on
November 17, 2011. On May 1, 2017, the last full trading day before the public announcement of the signing of the Merger Agreement,
the closing price of Angie's List common stock on NASDAQ was $5.89 per share. On August 28, 2017, the last practicable trading day
before the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, the closing price of Angie's List common stock on NASDAQ was $11.87 per share.

        The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices per share of Angie's List common stock on NASDAQ during each of the
quarterly periods indicated.

 

 

        As of August 25, 2017, Angie's List had approximately 9 registered stockholders of record. The number of stockholders of record is
based upon the actual number of stockholders registered at such date and does not include holders of shares in "street name" or persons,
partnerships, associations, corporations or other entities identified in security position listings maintained by depositories.

        The above table shows only historical market prices. Angie's List stockholders are urged to consult publicly available sources to
obtain current market quotations for Angie's List common stock, and to review carefully the other information contained in this proxy
statement/prospectus (including the information incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus), in considering whether to
approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement at the Angie's List special meeting. The market price of Angie's List common stock
is expected to fluctuate between the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and the Closing. No assurances can be given concerning the
market price of Angie's List common stock at any time in the future, or the market price of Class A shares of ANGI Homeservices after the
Closing. Changes in the market price of Angie's List common stock prior to the Closing will affect the number of Class B shares of ANGI
Homeservices to be issued to IAC prior to the Closing, and thus the aggregate economic interest in ANGI Homeservices as of the Closing
of the Angie's List stockholders who receive the Share Consideration in the Merger. For additional information, see the section entitled

the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the Angie's List board of directors and will depend on then-

PRO FORMA SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT OF ANGI
HOMESERVICES 

        Prior to the Effective Time, all of the outstanding shares of common stock of ANGI Homeservices will be owned by IAC. The
following pro forma security ownership table sets forth information with respect to the estimated beneficial ownership of (i) each person
or entity who is expected to beneficially own more than five percent of the outstanding shares of any class of ANGI Homeservices
common stock immediately following the Effective Time, to the extent known by ANGI Homeservices or Angie's List or ascertainable
from public filings, and (ii) each person who is expected (as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus) to serve as a director or a
named executive officer of ANGI Homeservices, as well as all expected directors and executive officers of ANGI Homeservices as a
group. For illustrative purposes, the following pro forma security ownership table assumes that all of the stockholders of Angie's List
receive the Share Consideration in the Merger and that the Effective Time occurred on August 18, 2017.

        The pro forma security ownership of ANGI Homeservices common stock immediately following the Effective Time presented in the
following table has been estimated based upon the following (using information available as of August 18, 2017):

• total outstanding shares of Angie's List common stock of 61,288,904 (assuming full settlement of options exercised
through August 18, 2017); 

• an assumed average of the daily dollar-volume-weighted average price for Angie's List common stock on NASDAQ for
each of the ten trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date of $11.80 (which for simplicity was the closing price
of Angie's List common stock on the NASDAQ on August 17, 2017); 

• outstanding Angie's List equity awards consisting of (i) 2,312,486 restricted stock units in respect of Angie's List common
stock, (ii) 2,879,663 performance awards of restricted stock units and (iii) stock options to purchase 5,352,725 shares of
Angie's List common stock with a weighted average per share exercise price of $10.54, each assuming full settlement of
options exercised through August 18, 2017; 

• total outstanding shares of HomeAdvisor, Inc. of 122,864,560 (assuming completion of the restructuring or reorganization
of the assets and liabilities comprising the HomeAdvisor Business in accordance with the Contribution Agreement); and 

• 3,935,649 outstanding vested in-the-money HomeAdvisor, Inc. stock appreciation rights with an average per share exercise
price of $3.73, and 7,856,169 outstanding unvested in-the-money HomeAdvisor, Inc. stock appreciation rights with an
average per share exercise price of $12.67 (in each case, prior to applying the adjustments described under "Ancillary
Agreements—Employee Matters Agreement").

        So far as is known to ANGI Homeservices, each of the persons indicated below would have sole voting power with respect to the
shares estimated to be owned by them, except as otherwise stated in the notes to the table.

        For purposes of the following pro forma security ownership table, beneficial ownership of shares of ANGI Homeservices Class B
common stock, though convertible following the Effective Time on a one-for-one basis into shares of ANGI Homeservices Class A
common stock, is reported as beneficial ownership of Class B common stock, and not as beneficial ownership of Class A common stock,
but the voting power of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock has been aggregated. The percentage of votes for all classes
of capital stock is based on one vote for each share of ANGI Homeservices Class A common stock and ten votes for each share of ANGI
Homeservices Class B common stock.

        Based on the foregoing assumptions, immediately following the Effective Time, (i) former holders of Angie's List common stock and
equity awards would hold, in the aggregate, Class A shares

Table of Contents

representing approximately 12.7% of the economic interest in ANGI Homeservices common stock (on a fully diluted basis, calculated
using the treasury stock method), and less than 2% of the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices common stock, (ii) IAC would hold
Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices representing approximately 80.6% of the economic interest (on a fully diluted basis, calculated
using the treasury stock method) and approximately 97.6% of the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices common stock and
(iii) former holders of equity awards in respect of HomeAdvisor, Inc. (which will be converted into awards in respect of ANGI
Homeservices in connection with the Transactions) would hold Class A shares representing approximately 6.7% of the economic interest
(on a fully diluted basis, calculated using the treasury stock method) and approximately 0.8% of the total voting power of ANGI
Homeservices common stock.

        The share ownership figures set forth in the previous paragraph calculate shares to be issued with respect to former Angie's List stock
options on a treasury stock method basis, that is, assuming the proceeds from the payment of the exercise price on stock options are used
by the company to repurchase shares. RSUs are reflected on gross basis. ANGI Homeservices expects, however, that a significant portion
of the outstanding equity awards will be net settled. Net settlement significantly reduces the number of shares issued in respect of an
award, as approximately 45% of the intrinsic value of the award would be settled by cash tax remittances by the company on behalf of the
employee. In addition, the share ownership figures in the previous paragraph do not give effect to any potential repurchases of ANGI
Homeservices shares that could be financed with the tax benefits that may accrue to ANGI Homeservices at the time of exercise or
settlement of the awards.

PROPOSAL 1—THE MERGER PROPOSAL 

        As discussed throughout this proxy statement/prospectus, Angie's List is asking its stockholders to approve the proposal to adopt the
Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Angie's List will be acquired by ANGI Homeservices, which at that time
will hold the HomeAdvisor Business. Specifically, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Angie's List,
with Angie's List surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of ANGI Homeservices. Following the Merger, Angie's List common
stock will be delisted from NASDAQ, deregistered under the Exchange Act and cease to be publicly traded. The Class A shares of ANGI
Homeservices to be issued to Angie's List stockholders who receive the Share Consideration in the Merger are expected to trade on
NASDAQ under the current Angie's List ticker symbol, "ANGI."

        Holders of shares of Angie's List common stock should carefully read this proxy statement/prospectus in its entirety, including its
Annexes and the information incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, for more detailed information concerning the
Merger Agreement and the Merger. In particular, holders of shares of Angie's List common stock are directed to the sections entitled "The
Transactions" and "The Merger Agreement," as well as to the Merger Agreement itself, a copy of which is attached as Annex B to this
proxy statement/prospectus.

        Under the Merger Agreement, the consummation of the Merger is conditioned upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement by
Angie's List stockholders.

Vote Required and Recommendation of the Angie's List Board of Directors

        Approval of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of common stock of Angie's List.

        The Angie's List board of directors unanimously recommends that Angie's List stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to
adopt the Merger Agreement.

PROPOSAL 2—ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 

        Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act of 2010, Angie's List is asking its stockholders to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote on the compensation that may be payable to its
named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as described in the section entitled "The Transactions—Interests of Angie's List's
Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions—Golden Parachute Compensation," including in the associated narrative discussion.
In accordance with these requirements, Angie's List is asking its stockholders to vote on the adoption of the following resolution:

        "RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be payable to Angie's List's named executive officers in connection with the Merger, as
disclosed in the table captioned "Golden Parachute Payment" in the section entitled "The Transactions—Interests of Angie's List's
Directors and Executive Officers in the Transactions—Golden Parachute Compensation," including the associated narrative discussion,
and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be payable, are hereby APPROVED."

Vote Required and Recommendation of the Angie's List Board of Directors

        The approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of Angie's List common stock
present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on such matter. The vote on the executive
compensation payable in connection with the Merger is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the Merger Agreement. You may
vote to approve this proposal and vote not to approve the Angie's List Merger proposal, or you may vote against this proposal and vote to
adopt the Merger Agreement. Because the vote on this proposal is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on Angie's List.
Accordingly, because Angie's List is contractually obligated to pay the compensation covered by this proposal, such compensation will be
payable, subject only to certain applicable conditions, if the Merger is approved and regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.

        The Angie's List board of directors unanimously recommends that Angie's List stockholders vote "FOR" this proposal.

        If you return a properly executed proxy card, but do not indicate voting instructions on your proxy card with respect to this proposal,
your shares of Angie's List common stock represented by such proxy card will be voted "FOR" this proposal.

PROPOSAL 3—ADJOURNMENT 

        Angie's List stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give Angie's List the authority to adjourn the special meeting
if necessary or appropriate, including to solicit additional proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement if there are not
sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to adopt the Merger Agreement. If this adjournment proposal is approved, the special
meeting could be adjourned by the Angie's List board of directors to any date, subject to specified limitations set forth in the Merger
Agreement. In addition, the Angie's List board of directors could postpone the special meeting before it commences, whether for the
purpose of soliciting additional proxies or for other reasons. If the special meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies, stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use.

        If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you sign and return a proxy and you
indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement but do not indicate a choice on the adjournment
proposal, your shares of Angie's List common stock will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal. However, if you indicate that you
wish to vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, your shares of Angie's List common stock will only be voted in favor of
the adjournment proposal if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of that proposal.

        If the special meeting is adjourned, any Angie's List stockholder who has already submitted his or her proxy will be able to revoke it
at any time prior to its use.

        Angie's List does not intend to call a vote on this proposal if Proposal 1 (regarding the adoption of the Merger Agreement) has been

FUTURE ANGIE'S LIST STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 

        If the Merger is consummated, Angie's List will no longer have public stockholders, and there will be no public participation in any
future meetings of stockholders of Angie's List. However, if the Merger is not consummated, stockholders of Angie's List will continue to
be entitled to attend and participate in meetings of stockholders of Angie's List.

        If the Merger is not consummated and Angie's List's 2018 annual meeting of stockholders is held, to be considered for inclusion in
Angie's List's 2018 proxy materials, a proposal of an Angie's List stockholder must be submitted in writing by January 4, 2018 to Angie's
List's Corporate Secretary at 1030 East Washington Street, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202. If an Angie's List stockholder wishes to submit a
proposal that is not to be included in the 2018 proxy materials pursuant to the SEC's stockholder proposal procedures or to nominate a
director, such stockholder must do so between February 13, 2018 and March 15, 2018, provided that if the date of the 2018 annual meeting
of stockholders is earlier than May 14, 2018 or later than August 22, 2018, you must give notice no earlier than 120 days prior to such
annual meeting date and no later than the later of 70 days prior to the date of the meeting or the 10th day following the day of public
announcement of the annual meeting date by Angie's List. Angie's List stockholders are advised to review Angie's List's Amended and
Restated Bylaws, which contain additional requirements about advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.

HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS 

        The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy
statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or
annual report, as applicable, addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially
provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.

        Brokers with account holders who are Angie's List stockholders may be "householding" Angie's List's proxy materials. A single
proxy statement may be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the
affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that it will be "householding" communications to your address,
"householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you notify your broker or Angie's List that you no longer wish to
participate in "householding."

        If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, you may
(1) notify your broker, (2) direct your written request to: Investor Relations, Angie's List, Inc., 1030 East Washington Street, Indianapolis,
Indiana 46202 or (3) contact Angie's List's Investor Relations department by telephone at (888) 619-2655. Angie's List will promptly
deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the proxy materials to a stockholder at a
shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy
materials at their address and would like to request "householding" of their communications should contact their broker.

NOTE 1—THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of operations

        The HomeAdvisor Business is the operator of the largest global home services marketplace, connecting homeowners with service
professionals for home repair, maintenance and improvement projects. HomeAdvisor's marketplace provides the tools and resources to
allow homeowners to find local pre-screened service professionals and instantly book appointments online or through HomeAdvisor's
award-winning mobile application. HomeAdvisor's marketplace also provides consumers with other home services-related resources,
including access to average project costs using HomeAdvisor's True Cost Guide. In addition to its market-leading U.S. operations, the
HomeAdvisor Business owns the leading home services online marketplaces in Canada (HomeStars), which was acquired on February 8,
2017, Germany (MyHammer), which was acquired on November 3, 2016, France (Travaux.com) and the Netherlands (Werkspot), as well
as operations in Italy (Instapro) and the United Kingdom (MyBuilder), which was acquired on March 24, 2017. The HomeAdvisor
Business also operates Felix, a pay-per-call advertising service, and mHelpDesk, a provider of cloud-based field service software for small
to mid-size businesses.

        As of June 30, 2017, the HomeAdvisor Business's network of service professionals in the United States consisted of approximately
164,000 paying professionals providing services in more than 500 categories ranging from simple home repairs to larger home remodeling
projects in more than 400 discrete geographies. The HomeAdvisor Business generated approximately 8.9 million domestic service
requests from homeowners in the Unites States during the six months ended June 30, 2017.

        On May 1, 2017, IAC/InterActiveCorp ("IAC") announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Angie's List (the
"Merger Agreement") to combine the HomeAdvisor Business and Angie's List under a new publicly traded company to be called ANGI
Homeservices Inc. The Merger Agreement provides for the acquisition of Angie's List by ANGI Homeservices Inc. by way of the merger
of a direct wholly owned subsidiary of ANGI Homeservices Inc. with and into Angie's List (the "Merger"), with Angie's List continuing as
the surviving company in the Merger. Following the Merger, Angie's List and the parent entity that will hold the HomeAdvisor Business
will each be direct wholly owned subsidiaries of ANGI Homeservices Inc. Immediately following the completion of the Merger, IAC is
expected to hold Class B shares of ANGI Homeservices Inc. which together with Class A shares underlying equity awards in respect of
HomeAdvisor (US) to be converted into awards in respect of ANGI Homeservices Inc., will represent between approximately 87% and
90% of the economic interest (on a fully diluted basis) and approximately 98% of the total voting power of ANGI Homeservices Inc.
common stock, depending on the number of Angie's List stockholders that elect to receive cash consideration in the Merger. The Merger is
expected to take place in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2017.

        All references to "HomeAdvisor," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us" in these historical combined financial statements are to the
HomeAdvisor Business, which is comprised of HomeAdvisor (US), HomeAdvisor (International) and each of their respective subsidiaries.

Basis of presentation

        The Company prepares its combined financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP").

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(Unaudited)

NOTE 1—THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Basis of combination

        These historical combined financial statements have been prepared on a standalone basis and are derived from the historical
consolidated financial statements and accounting records of IAC. The combined financial statements reflect the historical financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the businesses comprising the HomeAdvisor Business since their respective dates of
acquisition by IAC and the allocation to the HomeAdvisor Business of certain IAC corporate expenses relating to the HomeAdvisor
Business based on the historical consolidated financial statements and accounting records of IAC. For the purpose of these financial
statements, income taxes have been computed as if the entities comprising the HomeAdvisor Business filed on a standalone, separate tax
return basis. The financial statements are being prepared on a combined basis as the final steps of the legal reorganization where IAC
contributes the HomeAdvisor Business, along with cash sufficient to fund the aggregate cash consideration payable in the Merger, if any,
to ANGI Homeservices Inc. are not yet complete and will not be complete until immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger.

        All intercompany transactions and balances between and among the Company, its subsidiaries and the entities comprising the
HomeAdvisor Business have been eliminated. All intercompany transactions between (i) HomeAdvisor and (ii) IAC and its subsidiaries,
with the exception of notes payable due to IAC subsidiaries, are considered to be effectively settled for cash at the time the transaction is
recorded. The total net effect of the settlement of these intercompany transactions is reflected in the combined statement of cash flows as a
financing activity and in the combined balance sheet as "Invested capital." The notes payable due to IAC subsidiaries are included in
"Long-term debt—related party" in the accompanying combined balance sheet.

        In the opinion of management, the assumptions underlying the historical combined financial statements of the HomeAdvisor
Business, including the basis on which the expenses have been allocated from IAC, are reasonable. However, the allocations may not
reflect the expenses that we may have incurred as an independent, standalone company for the periods presented.

        The accompanying unaudited combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial
information and with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited
combined financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair
presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year. The accompanying
unaudited interim combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual audited combined financial statements of
the HomeAdvisor Business and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Accounting estimates

        Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions during the preparation of its
combined financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These estimates, judgments and assumptions impact the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and

the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

        On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to: the recoverability of goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangible assets; the useful lives and recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment; the
carrying value of accounts receivable, including the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts; the determination of revenue
reserves; the liabilities for uncertain tax positions; the valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets; and the fair value of and
forfeiture rates for stock-based awards, among others. The Company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, its
forecasts and budgets and other factors that the Company considers relevant.

Recent accounting pronouncements

Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted by the Company

        In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common standard for all
industries. ASU No. 2014-09 was subsequently amended during 2015 and 2016; these amendments provide further revenue recognition
guidance related to principal versus agent considerations, performance obligations and licensing, and narrow-scope improvements and
practical expedients.

        ASU No. 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance under GAAP. The new standard provides a single principles-based, five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers.
This five-step model includes (1) identifying the contract(s) with the customer, (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract,
(3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognizing
revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. More specifically, revenue will be recognized when promised goods or services are
transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration expected in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-
09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for interim and
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Upon adoption, ASU No. 2014-09 may either be applied retrospectively to
each prior period presented or using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial
application.

        While the Company's evaluation of the impact of the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 on its combined financial statements continues, it
has progressed to the point where we have reached certain preliminary determinations. The Company will adopt ASU No. 2014-09 using
the modified retrospective approach effective January 1, 2018. Therefore, the cumulative effect of adoption will be reflected as an
adjustment to beginning retained earnings for the period ending March 31, 2018. The effect on the Company will be that sales
commissions, which represent the incremental direct costs of obtaining a service professional contract, will be capitalized and amortized
over the average life of a service professional. These costs are expensed as incurred currently. The cumulative effect of the adoption of

NOTE 1—THE COMPANY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

ASU No. 2014-09 will be to establish an asset equal to the unamortized cost of the sales commissions paid to obtain a service professional
and a related deferred tax liability with the net effect being recorded as an increase to retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. The ultimate
amounts recorded will depend upon both the timing and amount of monthly sales commissions during the year ended December 31, 2016
and the year ending December 31, 2017 and the average life of a service professional as of January 1, 2018. To illustrate the effect of
adoption on the Company's combined financial position, if January 1, 2017 were the date of adoption, the cumulative effect of adoption
would have been less than 9% of total assets, less than 8% of total liabilities and less than 10% of shareholders' equity. The Company does
not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2014-09 to have a material effect on its combined results of operations or cash flows.

        In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes pre-existing guidance on accounting for
leases in "Leases (Topic 840)" and generally requires all leases to be recognized in the statement of financial position. The provisions of
ASU No. 2016-02 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted. The provisions of
ASU No. 2016-02 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption
of this standard update will have on its combined financial statements.

        In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification
Accounting, which provides guidance about the changes to the terms and conditions of a share-based payment award that require an entity
to apply modification accounting in "Stock Compensation (Topic 718)." The provisions of ASU No. 2017-09 are effective for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017; early adoption is permitted. The provisions of ASU No. 2017-09 are to be applied
prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard update to
have a material impact on its combined financial statements and is currently evaluating the timing of adoption.

Accounting pronouncements adopted by the Company

        In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments, which clarifies how cash receipts and cash payments in certain transactions are presented and classified on the
statement of cash flows. The provisions of ASU No. 2016-15 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim periods, and will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be
required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable; early adoption is permitted. The Company early
adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2016-15 on January 1, 2017 and the adoption of this standard update did not have a material impact on
its combined financial statements.

        In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2016-09 on January 1, 2017. Excess tax benefits or
deficiencies related to equity awards to employees upon exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units after January 1,
2017 are (i) reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of the provision for

income taxes, rather than recognized in equity, and (ii) reflected as operating, rather than financing, cash flows in our combined statement
of cash flows. Excess tax benefits for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $33.5 million. Excess tax benefits of $7.4 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2016 were reclassified in the combined statement of cash flows to conform to the current year presentation. The
Company continues to account for forfeitures using an estimated forfeiture rate.

        In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for
Goodwill Impairment, which is intended to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment. The guidance eliminates the requirement to
calculate the implied fair value of goodwill under today's two-step impairment test to measure a goodwill impairment charge. The
provisions of ASU No. 2017-04 are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted. The
provisions of ASU No. 2017-04 are to be applied on a prospective basis. The Company early adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2017-04
on January 1, 2017 and the adoption of this standard update did not and is not expected to have a material impact on its combined financial
statements.

NOTE 2—INCOME TAXES

        HomeAdvisor is a member of IAC's consolidated federal and state income tax returns. In all periods presented, current and deferred
income taxes have been computed for the entities comprising the HomeAdvisor Business on an as if standalone, separate return basis.
HomeAdvisor's payments to IAC for its share of IAC's consolidated federal and state income tax return liabilities have been reflected
within cash flows from operating activities in the accompanying combined statements of cash flows.

        At the end of each interim period, the Company makes its best estimate of the annual expected effective income tax rate and applies
that rate to its ordinary year-to-date earnings or loss. The income tax provision or benefit related to significant, unusual, or extraordinary
items, if applicable, that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effects are individually computed and recognized in
the interim period in which they occur. In addition, the effect of changes in enacted tax laws or rates, tax status, judgment on the
realizability of a beginning-of-the-year deferred tax asset in future years or income tax contingencies is recognized in the interim period in
which the change occurs.

        The computation of the annual expected effective income tax rate at each interim period requires certain estimates and assumptions
including, but not limited to, the expected pre-tax income (or loss) for the year, projections of the proportion of income (and/or loss)
earned and taxed in foreign jurisdictions, permanent and temporary differences, and the likelihood of the realizability of deferred tax assets
generated in the current year. The accounting estimates used to compute the provision or benefit for income taxes may change as new
events occur, more experience is acquired, additional information is obtained or our tax environment changes. To the extent that the
expected annual effective income tax rate changes during a quarter, the effect of the change on prior quarters is included in income tax
provision in the quarter in which the change occurs.

NOTE 2—INCOME TAXES (Continued)

        For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $30.2 million. The income tax benefit for
the six months ended June 30, 2017 is due primarily to the effect of adopting the provisions of ASU No. 2016-09 on January 1, 2017.
Under ASU No. 2016-09, excess tax benefits generated by the settlement or exercise of stock-based awards of $33.5 million are
recognized as a reduction to the income tax provision rather than additional paid-in capital. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the
Company recorded an income tax provision of $4.3 million which represents an effective income tax rate of 51%. The effective income tax
rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016 is higher than the statutory rate of 35% due primarily to unbenefited losses in separate
jurisdictions.

        HomeAdvisor is routinely under audit by federal, state, local and foreign authorities in the area of income tax as a result of previously
filed separate company and consolidated tax returns with IAC. These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and
deductions and the allocation of income and deductions among various tax jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service is currently
auditing IAC's federal income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2010 through 2012, which includes the operations of the
HomeAdvisor Business. The statute of limitations for the years 2010 through 2012 has been extended to June 30, 2018. Returns filed in
various other jurisdictions are open to examination for various tax years beginning with 2009. Income taxes payable include reserves
considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns. Changes to reserves from period to
period and differences between amounts paid, if any, upon the resolution of audits and amounts previously provided may be material.
Differences between the reserves for income tax contingencies and the amounts owed by the Company are recorded in the period they
become known.

        The Company recognizes interest and, if applicable, penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision. At
both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company has not accrued any amount for the payment of either interest or penalties.

        At both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, unrecognized tax benefits are $0.6 million. Included in unrecognized tax benefits at
both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, is $0.6 million for tax positions included in IAC's consolidated tax return filings. If
unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2017 are subsequently recognized, income tax provision would be reduced by $0.6 million. The
comparable amount as of December 31, 2016 is also $0.6 million.

North America acquisition

        The Company acquired a 90% voting interest in HomeStars Inc. ("HomeStars"), a leading home services platform in Canada, on
February 8, 2017. The purchase price for HomeStars was $16.6 CAD million (or $12.7 million) in cash and is net of a $0.3 CAD million
(or $0.2 million) working capital adjustment to be paid in full to the Company in the third quarter of 2017. In connection with the
acquisition, the Company measured and recorded the acquisition date fair value of the 10% noncontrolling interest in HomeStars, which
totaled $1.9 CAD million (or $1.4 million). The determination of the fair value of noncontrolling interest was calculated using the implied
value of 100% of the enterprise value of the business using the purchase price.

        The financial results of HomeStars are included in the Company's combined financial statements, within the North America segment,
beginning February 8, 2017. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company included $2.2 million of revenue and $0.9 million of
net losses in its combined statement of operations related to HomeStars.

        The table below summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:

        The purchase price was based on the expected financial performance of HomeStars, not on the value of the net identifiable assets at
the time of acquisition. This resulted in a significant portion of the purchase price being attributed to goodwill because HomeStars is
complementary and synergistic to the other North America businesses of the HomeAdvisor Business.

        The fair values of the intangible assets acquired at the date of acquisition are as follows:

        Other current assets, current liabilities and other long-term liabilities of HomeStars were reviewed and adjusted to their fair values at
the date of acquisition, as necessary. The fair values of trade names and contractor relationships were determined using variations of the
income approach; specifically, in respective order, the relief from royalty and excess earnings methodologies. The fair values of developed
technology and user base were determined using a cost approach that utilized the cost to replace methodology. The valuations of the
intangible assets incorporate significant unobservable inputs and require significant judgment and estimates, including the amount and
timing of future cash flows and the determination of royalty and discount rates. The amount attributed to goodwill is not tax deductible.

Europe acquisitions

        The Company acquired a 75% voting interest in MyBuilder Limited ("MyBuilder"), a leading home services platform in the United
Kingdom, on March 24, 2017. The purchase price was £32.6 million (or $40.7 million) in cash and includes a £0.6 million (or
$0.8 million) working capital adjustment to be paid in full by the Company in the third quarter of 2017. In connection with the acquisition,
the Company measured and recorded the acquisition date fair value of the 25% noncontrolling interest in MyBuilder, which totaled
£10.7 million (or $13.3 million). The determination of the fair value of noncontrolling interest was calculated using the implied value of
100% of the enterprise value of the business using the purchase price.

        The financial results of MyBuilder are included in the Company's combined financial statements, within the Europe segment,
beginning April 1, 2017. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company included $2.7 million of revenue and $0.2 million of net
losses in its combined statement of operations related to MyBuilder.

        The table below summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:

        The purchase price was based on the expected financial performance of MyBuilder, not on the value of the net identifiable assets at
the time of acquisition. This resulted in a significant portion of the purchase price being attributed to goodwill because MyBuilder is
complementary and synergistic to the other European businesses of the HomeAdvisor Business.

        Other current assets, current liabilities and other long-term liabilities of MyBuilder were reviewed and adjusted to their fair values at
the date of acquisition, as necessary. The fair values of trade names and contractor relationships were determined using variations of the
income approach; specifically, in respective order, the relief from royalty and excess earnings methodologies. The fair values of developed
technology and user base were determined using a cost approach that utilized the cost to replace methodology. The valuations of the
intangible assets incorporate significant unobservable inputs and require significant judgment and estimates, including the amount and
timing of future cash flows and the determination of royalty and discount rates. The amount attributed to goodwill is not tax deductible.

        On November 3, 2016, the Company acquired a 70% voting interest in MyHammer Holding AG ("MyHammer"), the leading home
services marketplace in Germany. The purchase price was €17.7 million (or $19.7 million). In connection with the acquisition, the
Company measured and recorded the acquisition date fair value of the 30% noncontrolling interest in MyHammer, which totaled
€9.4 million (or $10.4 million). The determination of the fair value of noncontrolling interest was calculated using the MyHammer share
price on the acquisition date.

        The financial results of MyHammer are included in the Company's combined financial statements, within the Europe segment, with
effect from the date of acquisition. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company included $5.9 million of revenue and
$0.4 million of net losses in its combined statement of operations related to MyHammer.

        The table below summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition:

        The purchase price was based on the expected financial performance of MyHammer, not on the value of the net identifiable assets at

NOTE 4—GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Continued)

        At June 30, 2017, amortization of intangible assets with definite lives for each of the next five years is estimated to be as follows:

NOTE 5—FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

        The Company categorizes its financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in
pricing the asset or liability. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:

• Level 1: Observable inputs obtained from independent sources, such as quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in
active markets. 

• Level 2: Other inputs, which are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in
active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs that are
derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. 

• Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and require the Company to develop its own
assumptions, based on the best information available in the circumstances, about the assumptions market participants
would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.

(a) The Company's primary financial measure is Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as operating income excluding:
(1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) depreciation; and (3) acquisition-related items consisting of amortization
of intangible assets and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, if applicable. The Company believes this
measure is useful for analysts and investors as this measure allows a more meaningful comparison between our
performance and that of our competitors. Moreover, our management uses this measure internally to evaluate the
performance of our business as a whole and our individual business segments, and this measure is one of the primary
metrics by which our internal budgets are based and by which management is compensated. The above items are
excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, and we believe that by
excluding these items, Adjusted EBITDA corresponds more closely to the cash operating income generated from our
business, from which capital investments are made and long-term related party debt is serviced. Adjusted EBITDA
has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to HomeAdvisor's statement of operations of
certain expenses. 

(b) Consistent with the Company's primary metric (described in (a) above), the Company excludes, if applicable,
goodwill and intangible assets from the measure of segment assets presented above.

matters when it determines that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management
has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is not probable and, therefore, no reserve is
established. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, including claims where an unfavorable outcome is
reasonably possible, will not have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company, these
matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future. The Company also
evaluates other contingent matters, including income and non-income tax contingencies, to assess the likelihood of an unfavorable
outcome and estimated extent of potential loss. It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these lawsuits or other
contingencies could have a material impact on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of the Company. See "Note 2—
Income Taxes" for additional information related to income tax contingencies.

NOTE 9—RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Relationship with IAC prior to the Merger

        HomeAdvisor's combined statement of operations includes allocations of general and administrative costs, including stock-based
compensation expense, related to IAC's accounting, treasury, legal, tax, corporate support and internal audit functions. These allocations
were based on HomeAdvisor revenue as a percentage of IAC's total revenue. Allocated general and administrative costs, inclusive of
stock-based compensation expense, were $3.1 million and $2.1 million, in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in "General and
administrative expense" in the accompanying unaudited combined statement of operations. It is not practicable to determine the actual
expenses that

$42.0 million to a foreign subsidiary of IAC that is not part of HomeAdvisor. The proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of
MyHammer and refinance an $11.4 million promissory note that was previously outstanding. The promissory note bears interest at 11%
per annum and is payable at maturity.

        On March 20, 2017, the Company, through two foreign subsidiaries, issued promissory notes in the amount of £21.0 million

are payable at maturity.

        On February 7, 2017, the Company, through a foreign subsidiary, issued a promissory note due February 7, 2024 in the amount of
£8.4 million ($10.6 million at June 30, 2017) to a foreign subsidiary of IAC that is not part of HomeAdvisor. The proceeds were used to

promissory note bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.00%, or 3.54% at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

        Interest expense related to the long-term debt is included in "Interest expense—related party" in the accompanying combined
statement of operations.

$34.9 million were outstanding under the 2013 and 2012 Senior Notes, respectively.

NOTE 9—RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (Continued)

        IAC has a $300 million revolving credit facility which expires on October 7, 2020, and is unconditionally guaranteed by
HomeAdvisor (US) and the same domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the 2013 and 2012 Senior Notes and is also secured by the stock of
HomeAdvisor (US) and certain other domestic and foreign entities that are part of the HomeAdvisor Business. At June 30, 2017 and
December 31, 2016, there are no outstanding borrowings under IAC's revolving credit facility.

        The Company has not recorded a liability pursuant to this guarantor obligation because we have not agreed to pay a specific amount
through an arrangement with our co-obligors and we do not expect to pay any amount as a result of our guarantee of IAC's Senior Notes
and IAC's revolving credit facility. Upon completion of the Merger, HomeAdvisor (US) and certain of its wholly-owned domestic
subsidiaries will no longer guarantee any debt of IAC.

Relationship with IAC following the Merger

        We expect to enter into certain agreements with IAC to govern the relationship between ANGI Homeservices Inc. and IAC following
the Merger. These agreements will include: a contribution agreement; an investor rights agreement; a tax sharing agreement; a services
agreement; an employee matters agreement; and an intercompany note.

Report of independent registered public accounting firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of IAC/InterActiveCorp

        We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheet of the HomeAdvisor Business (the Company) as of December 31, 2016
and 2015, and the related combined statements of operations, comprehensive operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule on page FS-65. These
financial statements and financial schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

        We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Our audits
included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

        In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial position of the
HomeAdvisor Business at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the combined results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic combined financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
