TABLE OF CONTENTS

August 11, 2017

Dear West Marine Stockholders:

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) of West Marine, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (“West Marine,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), to be held on September 12, 2017, at 8:00 a.m., Pacific Time, at
West Marine Support Center located at 500 Westridge Drive, Watsonville, California 95076-4100.

On June 29, 2017, the Company entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Rising Tide
Parent Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Parent”), and Rising Tide Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (“Sub”). Parent and Sub are entities affiliated with Monomoy Capital Partners, a New York-based private
equity fund. Under the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the merger, Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the
Company surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger”). At the Special Meeting, we will ask you to
adopt the Merger Agreement.

At the effective time of the Merger, each share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“our common
stock”), issued and outstanding prior to the effective time, other than (i) shares held in the treasury of the Company or owned of
record by any wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Parent or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and (ii) shares of our
common stock held by stockholders who have not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who have perfected
their statutory right of appraisal in respect of such shares of our common stock in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law, will be cancelled and automatically be converted into the right to receive $12.97 per share in cash,
without interest (the “Merger Consideration”), subject to any withholding taxes.

The Merger Consideration represents a premium of approximately 34.4% over the closing price of our common stock reported
on The NASDAQ Global Select Market (the “NASDAQ”) on June 29, 2017, the last full trading day before the entering into of the
Merger Agreement, and approximately 31.7% over the average closing price of our common stock reported on the NASDAQ for
the trading days during the 30-day period ended on June 29, 2017.

In connection with the process to explore strategic alternatives available to the Company, the board of directors of the Company
(the “Board”) carefully reviewed and considered the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and unanimously (i) adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (ii)
approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (iii) determined that the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of the Company
and its stockholders, and (iv) recommended that the Company stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and directed that the
Merger Agreement be submitted to the Company stockholders for adoption. Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends a
vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1).

In addition, at the Special Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory
basis, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers that is based on or
otherwise relates to the Merger (Proposal 2) and a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit
additional proxies to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (Proposal 3). You will also at the Special Meeting be
asked to transact such other business as may properly come before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares of our common stock that you own. We cannot
consummate the Merger unless the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock

non-binding advisory vote, of the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive

voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and who have perfected their statutory right of appraisal in respect of such
shares of our common stock (the “Dissenting Shares”) in accordance with Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the “DGCL”), will be cancelled and automatically be converted into the right to receive in cash an amount equal to
$12.97 per share, without interest (the “Merger Consideration”), less any applicable withholding taxes. Following the
consummation of the Merger, you will no longer own any shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

If the Merger is consummated and your shares of our common stock are held in book-entry form, the Paying Agent (as defined
in the Merger Agreement and described in the section captioned “The Merger Agreement — Exchange and Payment Procedures”)
will issue and deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your shares without any further action on your part. If you are a
stockholder of record with your shares held in certificate form, you will receive a letter of transmittal with instructions on how to
send your stock certificate(s) representing your shares of our common stock to the Paying Agent following consummation of the
Merger. The Paying Agent will issue and deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your shares after you comply with these
instructions. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. See the section captioned “The Merger
Agreement — Exchange and Payment Procedures.”

If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your broker,
bank or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of your shares held in “street name.”

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 75)

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section captioned “The
Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s shares of our
common stock in the Merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of
our common stock surrendered in the Merger. Gain or loss realized generally must be calculated separately for each block of shares
(i.e., shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) surrendered pursuant to the Merger.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in the section captioned “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the
Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of shares of our common stock for
cash in the Merger, unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

The determination of actual tax consequences of the Merger to a holder of our common stock will depend on the holder’s
specific situation. For more information, see the section captioned “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger.” Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax
consequences relating to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S.
federal non-income tax laws or the laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Treatment of Equity Awards (Page 65)

The Merger Agreement provides for the following treatment as of the Effective Time of the stock options (“Options”) and time-
based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units (collectively, “RSUs”) that are outstanding under the
Company’s Amended and Restated Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the “Company Equity Incentive Plan”).

Options

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Option granted under the Company Equity Incentive Plan that is then
outstanding, all of which are fully vested, will be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such Option will be
entitled to receive payment of an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of our common stock subject
to such Option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share subject to
such Option, without interest; provided, however, that (i) any such Option with respect to which the exercise price per share subject
thereto is greater than the Merger Consideration will be cancelled in exchange for no consideration and (ii) such Option payments
may be reduced by the amount of any required tax withholdings as contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

RSUs

Employee RSUs

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of unvested RSUs (including performance-based stock units, referred to as
“PSUs”) granted under the Company Equity Incentive Plan that is then outstanding (other than those RSUs held by a non-employee
director of the Company) will be assumed by the Surviving Corporation and will be converted into a right to receive payment of an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of our common
stock subject to such RSUs, without interest (the “Cash Replacement Company RSUs”), which such Cash Replacement Company
RSUs will, subject to the holder’s continued employment with the Surviving Corporation through the applicable vesting dates, vest
and be payable at the same time as the RSUs for such Cash Replacement Company RSUs were exchanged would have vested
pursuant to their terms. All Cash Replacement Company RSUs will have the same terms and conditions as applied to the RSUs for
which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or for administrative or ministerial changes that are not materially detrimental to the holders and that are necessary for
the administration of the Cash Replacement Company RSUs. With respect to PSUs, the number of PSUs assumed by the Surviving
Corporation and converted into Cash Replacement Company RSUs will be determined (A) for PSUs with a performance period
that by its terms has ended prior to the Effective Time, based on actual performance through the end of such performance period,
and (B) for PSUs with a performance period that by its terms has not ended prior to the Effective Time, assuming performance at
100% of target levels.

Non-Employee Director RSUs

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of unvested RSUs granted under the Company Equity Incentive Plan that
is then outstanding and is held by a non-employee director of the Company will be fully vested and cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each holder of any such cancelled RSUs will be entitled to receive payment of an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of our common stock subject to such RSUs, without
interest; provided, however, that any such RSU payments may be reduced by the amount of any required tax withholdings as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Financing of the Merger (Page 63)

The Company and Parent estimate that the total amount of funds required to consummate the Merger and related transactions
and pay related fees and expenses will be approximately $354 million. This amount includes funds needed to (i) pay our
stockholders the amounts due to them under the Merger Agreement; (ii) make payments due as of the Effective Time in respect of
the Company’s outstanding equity awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement and (iii) pay all fees and expenses payable by Parent
and Sub in connection with the Merger and related transactions.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Parent expects this total amount to be funded through a combination of the following:

• debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of $250 million, consisting of (i) a $225 million senior secured first-lien
credit facility of which $200 million is an asset-based revolving line of credit and $25 million is a first-in last-out asset-
based term loan, and (ii) a $25 million second lien asset-based term loan; and

• cash equity investments by Monomoy in an aggregate amount of up to $130 million (the “Equity Financing”).

The obligations of Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger are not subject to any financing condition.

Conditions to the Merger (Page 96)

The respective obligations of the Company, Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, waiver of certain customary conditions, including, among other things, the following:

of the Merger;

• expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or extensions thereof) relating to the Merger under the Hart-

thereunder;

• the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the parties, subject to certain materiality or (with respect to certain
capitalization representations and warranties made by the Company) de minimus qualifications and exceptions;

• with respect to the obligations of Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger, the absence of any change, circumstance,
development, occurrence, state of facts, event or effect occurring after June 29, 2017 that has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a “Company Material Adverse Effect,” as defined in the Merger
Agreement;

• with respect to the obligations of Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger, the receipt by Parent of a certificate signed by
an executive officer of the Company as to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the fourth to sixth bullet points
above; and

• with respect to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger, the receipt by the Company of a certificate
signed by an executive officer of Parent as to the satisfaction of the condition set forth in the fourth and fifth bullet points
above.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (Page 77)

Parent and the Company have generally agreed to (and Parent has agreed to cause Sub and each of Parent’s and Sub’s affiliated
investment funds to and the Company has agreed to cause each of its subsidiaries to) use their reasonable best efforts to promptly
obtain all necessary actions, nonactions or approvals from governmental entities to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These actions, nonactions or approvals (i) include expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act (early termination of the waiting period was granted on July 25, 2017, and (ii)
may include the approval or clearance of the Merger pursuant to antitrust laws of potentially other jurisdictions as required.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals (Page 89)

Under the Merger Agreement, the Company is required to and is required to cause each of its subsidiaries to and its and their
respective directors, officers, employees, managers, consultants, accountants, advisors, investment bankers and counsel
(collectively, the “representatives”) to, cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any persons that may have been
ongoing with respect to any Competing Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement and described in the section captioned “The
Merger Agreement — Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals”) and terminate “data room” access for such persons and
their representatives and request the prompt return or destruction of any non-public information regarding the Company or its
subsidiaries furnished to such persons and their representatives. Except as permitted by the terms of the Merger Agreement, the
Company will not, and will cause each of its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives not to:

• initiate, solicit, facilitate, or knowingly encourage the submission of any Competing Proposal;

• furnish any non-public information regarding the Company or any of its subsidiaries to any third person in connection with
or in response to a Competing Proposal;

• participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third person with respect to any Competing Proposal;

• terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any confidentiality agreement or standstill
agreement to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is party;

• waive the applicability of all or any portion of any takeover statute in respect of any person; or

• resolve to agree to take any of the foregoing actions.

Under certain circumstances, however, and in compliance with its obligations contained in the Merger Agreement, the
Company may furnish information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries to, and participate in discussions or
negotiations with, the person making a Competing Proposal if, in addition to other conditions, the Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement and described in the section captioned “The Merger
Agreement — Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals”). Under certain circumstances, the Company is permitted to
terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal after or concurrently with
the payment by the Company to Parent of a termination fee of $11 million (the “Company Termination Fee”).

Termination of the Merger Agreement (Page 97)

The Merger Agreement may be terminated under the following circumstances:

• by Parent and the Company by mutual written consent if the Board has recommended termination;

• by either Parent or, if the Board recommended termination, the Company if:

• the closing of the Merger has not occurred on or before December 29, 2017 (the “Outside Date”);

• the Requisite Stockholder Approval has not been obtained at a stockholders’ meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof; or

• a governmental entity of competent jurisdiction has issued a final, non-appealable law, order, decree or injunction
permanently enjoining, restraining or prohibiting the Merger;

• by Parent, if:

• the Board has failed to include its recommendation that the Company stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement in this
proxy statement or has effected a Change of Company Recommendation (as defined in the Merger Agreement and
described in the section captioned “The Merger Agreement — Obligation of the Board with respect to Its
Recommendation”); or

• the Company has breached any of its representations, warranties or covenants in the Merger Agreement, and such
breach would result in certain conditions to the Merger not being satisfied and such breach is not curable prior to the
Outside Date or has not been cured within 30 calendar days after delivery of notice thereof by Parent to the Company;

• by the Company, if:

• prior to the Company stockholder approval, (i) the Board has effected a Change of Company Recommendation, (ii) the
Company has complied with the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, (iii) concurrently with, or

Outside Date or has not been cured within 30 calendar days after delivery of notice by the Company to Parent; or

• (i) all conditions to Parent’s and Sub’s obligations to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions, by their nature, are to be satisfied by actions taken at the closing, and each of which is capable of being
satisfied at the closing and is reasonably expected to be satisfied as of the closing), (ii) Parent and Sub fail to
consummate the Merger on the date as required by the Merger Agreement, (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed

consummate the Merger on the third business day following delivery of such written notice.

Effect of Termination (Page 98)

If the Merger Agreement is terminated, the Merge Agreement will become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on
the part of Parent, Sub or the Company or their respective subsidiaries, officers or directors or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing,
except that certain specified provisions of the Merger Agreement will survive any such termination and remain in full force and
effect. Subject to the termination fees payable by the Company or Parent described below, the termination of the Merger Agreement
will not relieve any party from any liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by another party as a result of such first party’s
intentional fraud or willful and material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the
Merger Agreement.

Stockholder Approval has not been obtained at the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, or (iii) by
Parent if the Company’s failure to perform in any material respect its obligations, agreements or covenants under the
Merger Agreement required to be performed prior to or at the closing has resulted in the closing condition relating to the
Company’s performance of obligations, agreements or covenants not being satisfied, and such failure is not curable prior to
the Outside Date, or if curable prior to the Outside Date, it has not been cured within 30 calendar days after delivery of
written notice thereof by Parent to the Company;

• prior to the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, a Competing Proposal has been publicly
disclosed; and

• within 12 months after the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company has entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Competing Proposal and any Competing Proposal is subsequently consummated; provided that each
reference to 20% in the definition of “Competing Proposal” will be deemed to be a reference to “50%.”

Reverse Termination Fee and Other Remedies (Page 99)

Parent has agreed to pay the Company $17 million (the “Reverse Termination Fee”) if the Merger Agreement is terminated as
described below:

• by the Company if (i) all conditions to Parent’s and Sub’s obligations to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions, by their nature, are to be satisfied by actions taken at the closing, and each of which is capable
of being satisfied at the closing and is reasonably expected to be satisfied as of the closing), (ii) Parent and Sub fail to
consummate the Merger on the closing date as required by the Merger Agreement, (iii) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed by written notice to Parent that (A) all conditions to the Company’s obligations to effect the Merger have been
satisfied or irrevocably waived (other than those conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
closing) and (B) the Company stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger (and it has not delivered written
notice purporting to revoke such notice) and (iv) Parent and Sub fail to consummate the Merger on the third business day
following delivery of such written notice; or

• by the Company or Parent if the closing has not occurred on or before the Outside Date (but only if the terminating party
has not materially breached any representation, warranty or covenant, which has caused the failure of the closing to occur
on or before the Outside Date) at a time when the Company had the right to terminate the Merger Agreement under the
circumstance described in the immediately preceding bullet point.

Furthermore, Parent has agreed that the Company has the right to seek damages following a termination of the Merger
Agreement by the Company in the instance where Parent or Sub has intentionally breached its covenants specified in Article V of
the Merger Agreement and such breach is not curable prior to the Outside Date or has not been cured within 30 days after delivery
of notice by the Company to Parent; provided, however, that under no circumstance will the Company or any of its affiliates be
entitled to receive damages for such alleged intentional breach in excess of $15 million.

In addition, prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company, the Company will be entitled to obtain specific
performance to cause Parent and Sub to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger under certain
circumstances. If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce such obligations of Parent and has instead
granted an award of damages for such alleged breach of Parent’s obligations and Parent does not consummate the Merger within
ten business days, the Company may enforce such award and accept damages for such alleged breach; provided, however, that
under no circumstances will the Company or any of its affiliates be entitled to enforce such an award or accept damages for such
alleged breach in excess of $25 million.

The Company will not be permitted or entitled to receive both such grant of specific performance (or damages contemplated
pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph) and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or damages relating to any
intentional breach.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Appraisal Rights (Page 70)

Under the DGCL, our stockholders that do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement have the right to seek
appraisal of the fair value of their shares of our common stock in cash as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery (the
“Court of Chancery”), but only if they comply fully with all of the applicable requirements of the DGCL for exercise of such
appraisal rights, which requirements are summarized in this proxy statement. Any appraisal amount determined by the Court of
Chancery could be more than, the same as, or less than the value of the Merger Consideration. Any stockholder intending to
exercise appraisal rights must, among other things, submit a written demand for appraisal to us before the vote on the adoption of
the Merger Agreement, and must not vote or otherwise submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. Failure to
follow the procedures specified under the DGCL will result in the loss of appraisal rights. Because of the complexity of the DGCL
relating to appraisal rights, if you are considering exercising your appraisal rights, we encourage you to promptly seek the advice of
your own legal and financial advisors. See the section captioned “The Merger — Appraisal Rights,” beginning on page 70, and
Annex C for additional information about these matters.

Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger (Page 43)

After careful consideration and consulting with the legal and financial advisors to the Board, the Board has unanimously (i)
adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (iii)
determined that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and (iv) recommended that the Company stockholders
adopt the Merger Agreement and directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the Company stockholders for adoption.

Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that you vote:

• “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement;

• “FOR” the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that may be paid or become payable to
the Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger; and

• “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes at that time to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (Page 64)

In considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you should
be aware that some of our directors and executive officers have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests
of the Company stockholders generally. You should keep this in mind when considering the recommendation of the Board in favor
of the adoption of the Merger Agreement. The Board was aware of these interests and considered them at the time the Board
approved the Merger Agreement and made its recommendation to the Company stockholders. For more information, see the section
captioned “The Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Voting Agreement (Page 101)

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Randolph K. Repass, his spouse and certain of the Repass family
trusts, which beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock as
of that date, entered into a voting and support agreement (the “Voting Agreement”) with Parent and Sub. Certain other Repass
family trusts, which beneficially owned shares of our common stock but were not able to deliver their signature pages concurrently
with the execution of the Merger Agreement, signed the Voting Agreement on the following day, June 30, 2017, which increased
the total issued and outstanding shares of our common stock subject to the Voting Agreement to approximately 24% as of June 30,
2017 and approximately 24% as of the Record Date. Pursuant to the Voting

Agreement, they agreed, among other things, during the period beginning on the date of the Voting Agreement and ending on its
termination date set forth therein, (i) to vote in favor of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, (ii) to certain restrictions in the transfer of their shares of our common stock, (iii) to vote against any action or
agreement which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent, delay or adversely affect the Merger Agreement
or the Merger and (iv) to not take and to cause his or her representatives to not take any actions, directly or indirectly, any actions
that the Company is prohibited from taking under the Merger Agreement as they relate to the restriction on the solicitation of
competing proposals. Mr. Repass executed the Voting Agreement as a Company stockholder, and therefore it does not limit or
restrict him from acting in his capacity as a director of the Company, in his discretion on any matter. The foregoing summary of the
Voting Agreement is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the full text of the Voting Agreement. A copy of the
Voting Agreement is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference.

Opinion of Guggenheim Securities, LLC (Page 47)

The Board retained Guggenheim Securities, LLC (“Guggenheim”) as its financial advisor in connection with the potential sale
of the Company. Guggenheim delivered an opinion to the Board to the effect that, as of June 29, 2017 and based on and subject to
the matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review
undertaken, the Merger Consideration was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of shares of our common stock (excluding
the Company or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries or Parent or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries). The full text of
Guggenheim’s written opinion, which is attached as Annex B to this proxy statement and which you should read carefully and in
its entirety, is subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and other conditions contained in such opinion and is
necessarily based on economic, capital markets and other conditions and the information made available to Guggenheim, as of the
date of such opinion.

Guggenheim’s opinion was provided to the Board (in its capacity as such) for its information and assistance in connection with
its evaluation of the Merger Consideration. Guggenheim’s opinion and any materials provided in connection therewith did not
constitute a recommendation to the Board with respect to the Merger, nor does Guggenheim’s opinion and any materials provided
in connection therewith constitute advice or a recommendation to any holder of shares of our common stock as to how to vote or
act in connection with the Merger or otherwise. Guggenheim’s opinion addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view
and as of the date of such opinion, of the Merger Consideration to be paid to holders of our common stock (excluding the Company
or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries or Parent or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries) to the extent expressly specified in such
opinion and does not address any other term, aspect or implication of the Merger, the Merger Agreement (including, without
limitation, the form or structure of the Merger) or any other agreement, transaction document or instrument contemplated by the
Merger Agreement or to be entered into or amended in connection with the Merger or any financing or other transactions related
thereto.

For a description of the opinion that the Board received from Guggenheim, see the section captioned “The Merger — Opinion
of Guggenheim Securities, LLC.” beginning on page 47.

Market Price and Dividend Data (Page 103)

Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “WMAR.” On June 29, 2017, the last full trading day prior to
the public announcement of the Merger, the closing price for our common stock was $9.65 per share. On August 4, 2017, the latest
practicable date before the printing of this proxy statement, the closing price for our common stock was $12.89 per share.

Certain Effects of the Merger (Page 31)

Upon consummation of the Merger, Sub will be merged with and into the Company upon the terms set forth in the Merger
Agreement. As the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, the Company will continue to exist following the Merger as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent.

Following the consummation of the Merger, shares of our common stock will no longer be traded on the NASDAQ or any other
public market. In addition, the registration of shares of our common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”), will be terminated.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Effect on the Company if the Merger is Not Consummated (Page 32)

If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, the
Company stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock. Instead, the Company will remain an
independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ and registered under the
Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic and current reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

The Special Meeting (Page 23)

Date, Time and Place

A special meeting of the Company stockholders (the “Special Meeting”) will be held on September 12, 2017, at 8:00 a.m.,
Pacific Time, at West Marine Support Center located at 500 Westridge Drive, Watsonville, California 95076-4100.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote

You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of our common stock at the close of business on August 3,
2017 (the “Record Date”). You will have one vote at the Special Meeting for each share of our common stock that you owned at the
close of business on the Record Date.

Purpose

At the Special Meeting, we will ask our stockholders to vote on proposals to: (1) adopt the Merger Agreement; (2) approve, by
non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers
that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger and (3) adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting. You will also at the Special
Meeting be asked to transact such other business as may properly come before the Special Meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

Quorum

The presence at the Special Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock
issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting constitutes a quorum for the purpose of considering the
proposals. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 25,274,566 shares of our common stock outstanding. If you
are a Company stockholder of record as of the close of business on the Record Date and you vote by mail, by telephone, through
the Internet or in person at the Special Meeting, you will be considered part of the quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of
shares of our common stock and you provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares
will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of shares and you do not provide your
bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will not be counted as present in determining the presence
of a quorum.

Required Vote

If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock is required
to adopt the Merger Agreement. A failure to vote your shares of our common stock or an abstention from voting will have the same
effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

Approval of each of the non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the
Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger, if a quorum is present and the proposal to
adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, requires the affirmative vote of the
majority of the votes cast for either proposal. Abstentions and failure to vote your shares will have no effect on these proposals.

As described above, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Randolph K. Repass, his spouse and certain of
the Repass family trusts, which beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of
our common stock as of that date, entered into the Voting Agreement

with Parent and Sub. Certain other Repass family trusts, which beneficially owned shares of our common stock but were not able to
deliver their signature pages concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, signed the Voting Agreement on the
following day, June 30, 2017, which increased the total issued and outstanding shares of our common stock subject to the Voting
Agreement to approximately 24% as of June 30, 2017 and approximately 24% as of the Record Date. Pursuant to the Voting
Agreement, they agreed, among other things, during the period beginning on the date of the Voting Agreement and ending on its
termination date set forth therein, to vote in favor of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

How to Vote

If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, LLC, you may cause your
shares to be voted by returning a signed and dated proxy card in the accompanying prepaid envelope, or you may vote in person at
the Special Meeting. Additionally, you may grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone by following the
instructions on your proxy card.

If you plan to attend the Special Meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the Special Meeting. If your
shares are registered in your name, you are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person. If
you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or
other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or attending the
Special Meeting and voting in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee. Unless you give your bank,
broker, trust or other nominee instructions on how to vote your shares of our common stock, your bank, broker or other nominee
will not be able to vote your shares at the Special Meeting.

YOU SHOULD NOT SEND IN YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) WITH YOUR PROXY CARD. A letter of transmittal
with instructions for the surrender of certificates representing shares of our common stock will be mailed to stockholders if the
Merger is consummated.

For additional information regarding the procedure for delivering your proxy, see the sections captioned “The Special
Meeting — Voting of Proxies” beginning on page 25. If you have any questions about the Merger or how to submit your proxy, or if
you need additional copies of this proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card or voting instructions, please contact our Corporate
Secretary at 500 Westridge Drive, Watsonville, California 95076-4100.

Litigation Related to the Merger (Page 78)

The Company and its directors have been named as defendants in certain lawsuits brought by purported stockholders of the
Company seeking, among other things, equitable relief that would enjoin consummation of the Merger. For more information, see
the section captioned “The Merger — Litigation Related to the Merger.”

Q: Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?

A: Stockholders as of the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the
Special Meeting. Each holder of shares of our common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought before
the Special Meeting for each share of our common stock owned as of the Record Date.

Q: May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?

A: Yes. All stockholders as of the close of business on the Record Date may attend the Special Meeting and vote in person. Seating
will be limited. Stockholders will need to present proof of ownership of shares of our common stock, such as a bank or
brokerage account statement, and a form of personal identification to be admitted to the Special Meeting. No cameras, recording
equipment, electronic devices, large bags, briefcases or packages will be permitted in the Special Meeting.

Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, to ensure that your shares of our common stock will be represented at
the Special Meeting we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply

If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares in
accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. Your broker or
other agent cannot vote on any of the proposals, including the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, without your

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What is the proposed Merger and what effects will it have on the Company?

A: The proposed Merger is the acquisition of the Company by Parent. If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement is approved
by stockholders and the other closing conditions under the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived, Sub will merge
with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the Surviving Corporation. As a result of the Merger, the Company
will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent and an affiliate of Monomoy Capital Partners, and our common stock will no
longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from the NASDAQ. In addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the
Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic or current reports with the SEC.

Q: What will I receive if the Merger is consummated?

A: As a result of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of our common stock prior to the Effective Time, other than the
Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares, will be cancelled and cease to exist and will automatically be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, equal to $12.97 per share in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding taxes. For
example, if you own 100 shares of our common stock, you will receive $1,297.00 in cash in exchange for your shares of our
common stock, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

Q: How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of the common stock?

A: The Merger Consideration represents a premium of approximately 34.4% over the closing price of our common stock $9.65, as
reported on the NASDAQ on June 29, 2017, the last full trading day before the entering into of the Merger Agreement, and
approximately 31.7% over the average closing price of our common stock reported on the NASDAQ for the trading days during
the 30-day period ended on June 29, 2017.

Q: Why am I being asked to consider and cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve certain compensation that may be
paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger?

A: In July 2010, the SEC adopted rules that require companies to seek a non-binding advisory vote to approve certain
compensation that may be paid or become payable to their named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to
corporate transactions such as the Merger. In accordance with the rules promulgated under Section 14A of the Exchange Act,
the Company is providing its stockholders with the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote on compensation that may
be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger. For
additional information, see the section captioned “The Special Meeting — Proposal 2: Advisory, Non-Binding Vote to Approve
Certain Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements.”

Q: What will happen if the Company stockholders do not approve the non-binding compensation advisory proposal?

A: The vote to approve the non-binding compensation advisory proposal is a vote separate and apart from the vote to adopt the
Merger Agreement. Approval of the non-binding compensation advisory proposal is not a condition to consummation of the
Merger, and it is advisory in nature only, meaning that it will not be binding on the Company or Parent or any of their respective
subsidiaries. Accordingly, if the Merger Agreement is adopted by the Company stockholders and the Merger is consummated,
the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger will be payable to our named executive officers even if this
proposal is not approved.

Q: What do I need to do now?

A: We encourage you to (i) read this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents that we refer to in this
proxy statement carefully and consider how the Merger affects you, and (ii) then sign, date and return, as promptly as possible,
the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying reply envelope, or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone, so that your shares can be voted at the Special Meeting. If you hold your shares in “street name,” please refer to the
voting instruction forms provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: Should I send in my stock certificates now?

A: No. After the Merger is consummated, you will receive a letter of transmittal containing instructions for how to send your stock
certificates to the Paying Agent in order to receive the appropriate cash payment for the shares of our common stock represented
by your stock certificates, as described in the section captioned “The Merger Agreement — Exchange and Payment Procedures.”
You should use the letter of transmittal to exchange your stock certificates for the cash payment to which you are entitled.
Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card.

If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your broker,
bank or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of your shares held in “street name.”

Q: What happens if I sell or otherwise transfer my shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the Special
Meeting?

A: The Record Date for the Special Meeting is earlier than the date of the Special Meeting and the date the Merger is expected to
be completed. If you sell or transfer your shares of our common stock after the Record Date but before the Special Meeting,
unless special arrangements (such as provision of a proxy) are made between you and the person to whom you sell or otherwise
transfer your shares and each of you notifies the Company in writing of such special arrangements, you will transfer the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, if the Merger is completed, to the person to whom you sell or transfer your shares, but you
will retain your right to vote those shares at the Special Meeting. Even if you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of our
common stock after the Record Date, we encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the
accompanying reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone.

Q: How does the Board recommend that I vote?

A: The Board, after considering the various factors described in the section captioned “The Merger —  Recommendation of the
Board and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously (i) adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) approved
the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (iii) determined that the Merger Agreement, and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, and (iv) recommended that the Company stockholders adopt the Merger Agreement and directed that the Merger
Agreement be submitted to the Company stockholders for adoption.

Accordingly, the Board recommends that you vote (i) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (ii) “FOR” the proposal
to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger and (iii) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement.

Q: What happens if the Merger is not consummated?

A: If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, stockholders
will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public
company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act, and
we will continue to file periodic and current reports with the SEC. See the section captioned “The Merger — Effect on the
Company if the Merger is Not Consummated.”

Under specified circumstances, the Company will be required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee upon the termination
of the Merger Agreement, as described in the section captioned “The Merger Agreement — Company Termination Fee.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What constitutes a quorum?

A: The presence at the Special Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock
issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting constitutes a quorum for the purpose of considering the
proposals. As of the close of business on the Record Date, there were 25,274,566 shares of our common stock outstanding. If
you are a Company stockholder of record (i.e., your shares of our common stock are registered in your name with the
Company’s transfer agent) as of the close of business on the Record Date and you vote by mail, by telephone, through the
Internet or in person at the Special Meeting, you will be considered part of the quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of
shares of our common stock (i.e., you hold your shares in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee and these proxy materials
are being forwarded to you by that entity) and you provide your bank, broker, trust or other nominee with voting instructions,
then your shares will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of shares and you
do not provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will not be counted as present in
determining the presence of a quorum.

All shares of our common stock held by stockholders that are present in person, or represented by proxy, and entitled to vote at
the Special Meeting, regardless of how such shares are voted or whether such stockholders have indicated on their proxy that
they are abstaining from voting, will be counted in determining the presence of a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the
Special Meeting may be adjourned.

Q: What vote is required to approve the Adoption of the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1)?

A: Adoption of the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1).  The adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote on such proposal.

If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting, the failure of any stockholder of record to (i) submit a signed proxy card, (ii)
grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone or (iii) vote in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will have the same effect
as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you hold your shares in “street name” and a quorum is
present at the Special Meeting, the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will have the
same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If a quorum is present at the Special Meeting,
abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

Q: What vote is required to approve the Advisory Vote regarding Merger-Related Compensation (Proposal 2) and the
Adjournment or Postponement of the Special Meeting (Proposal 3)?

A: Advisory Vote regarding Merger-Related Compensation (Proposal 2).  Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of certain
compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise
relates to the Merger requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast for the proposal.

Adjournment or Postponement of the Special Meeting (Proposal 3).  Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of
the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast for the
proposal.

The failure of any stockholder of record to (i) submit a signed proxy card, (ii) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone or
(iii) vote in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on either of Proposal 2 or Proposal 3. If you hold
your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares will not have
any effect on either of these proposals. Similarly, abstentions will have no effect on these proposals.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?

A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, LLC, you are
considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “stockholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card
have been sent directly to you by the Company.

If your shares are held through a bank, broker or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of our
common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your bank, broker or other
nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the
right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are
also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your
shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Q: Will my shares held in “street name” or another form of record ownership be combined for voting purposes with shares
I hold of record?

A: No. For voting purposes, any shares you may hold in “street name” will be deemed to be held by a different stockholder than
any shares you hold of record, and as a result, any shares held in “street name” will not be combined for voting purposes with
shares that you hold of record. Similarly, if you own shares in various registered forms, such as jointly with your spouse, as
trustee of a trust or as custodian for a minor, you will receive, and will need to sign and return, a separate proxy card for the
shares held in each such form, because they are held in a different form of record ownership. Shares held by a corporation or
business entity must be voted by an authorized officer of the entity. Shares held in an individual retirement account must be
voted under the rules governing such account.

Q: How may I vote?

A: If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if your shares of our common stock are registered in your name with Computershare
Investor Services, LLC, our transfer agent), there are four ways to vote:

• by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;

• by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;

• by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card; or

• by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot;

A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of our
common stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the
Internet or by telephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over
the Internet or by telephone, you may incur costs such as Internet access and telephone charges for which you will be
responsible.

Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of our common stock
by proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote
your shares of our common stock in person by ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you
are present at the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or
other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, or, if such a
service is provided by your bank, broker or other nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone. To vote over the
Internet or by telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting form
provided by your bank, broker or nominee.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?

A: No. Your bank, broker or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at
the Special Meeting only if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures
provided by your bank, broker or other nominee to vote your shares. Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such
proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted against adoption of the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on
the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the
Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger or the proposal to adjourn the Special
Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at
the time of the Special Meeting.

Q: May I change my vote after I have mailed my signed proxy card?

A: Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the
Special Meeting by:

• signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us in accordance with the instructions therein prior to the
Special Meeting;

• submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;

• delivering a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary; or

• attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you hold your shares of our common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for
instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal
proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Q: If a stockholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?

A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When
completing the Internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or
against or to abstain from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.

If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the
shares represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (i) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement; (ii) “FOR”
the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the
Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger; and (iii) “FOR” the adjournment of
the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger
Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting.

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?

A: Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone) each proxy card and voting
instruction card that you receive. You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy
statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage
account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a
stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?

A: The Company intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four
business days following the Special Meeting. All reports that the Company files with the SEC are publicly available when filed.
See the section captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”

Q: Will I be subject to U.S. federal income tax upon the exchange of common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger?

A: If you are a U.S. Holder (as defined under the section captioned “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger”), the exchange of our common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger generally will require you to
recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of
cash you received pursuant to the Merger and your adjusted tax basis in the shares of our common stock surrendered pursuant to
the Merger.

A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined under the section captioned “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of
the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of our common stock for
cash in the Merger unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

You should consult your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to you in
light of your own particular circumstances and any consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign
taxing jurisdiction. A more complete description of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger is provided
under the section captioned “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger.”

Q: What will happen to outstanding West Marine equity-based awards in the Merger?

A: For information regarding the treatment of outstanding West Marine equity-based awards, see the section captioned “The
Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Treatment of Equity-Based Awards.”

Q: What will happen to the Company’s Amended and Restated Associates Stock Buying Plan?

A: For information regarding the treatment of Company’s Amended and Restated Associates Stock Buying Plan (the “SPP”), see
the section captioned “The Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Treatment of
Purchase Rights under the SPP.”

Q: When do you expect the Merger to be Consummated?

A: We are working toward consummating the Merger as quickly as possible and currently expect to consummate the Merger in the
third quarter of fiscal year 2017. However, the exact timing of consummation of the Merger cannot be predicted because the
Merger is subject to the closing conditions described in the section captioned “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the
Merger,” many of which are outside of our control.

Q: If the Merger is consummated, how will I receive the cash for my shares?

A: If the Merger is consummated and your shares of our common stock are held in book-entry, the Paying Agent (as defined in the
Merger Agreement and described in the section captioned “The Merger Agreement — Exchange and Payment Procedures”) will
issue and deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your shares without any further action on your part. If you are a stockholder
of record with your shares held in certificate form, you will receive a letter of transmittal with instructions on how to send your
shares of our common stock to the Paying Agent in connection with the Merger. The Paying Agent will issue and deliver to you
a check or wire transfer for your shares after you comply with these instructions. Please do not send your stock certificates
with your proxy card. See the section captioned “The Merger Agreement — Exchange and Payment Procedures.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your broker,
bank or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of your shares held in “street name.”

Q: Am I entitled to appraisal rights under Delaware law?

A: If the Merger is consummated, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and who properly demand, and perfect, appraisal of their shares will
be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the “DGCL”). This means that holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to have their shares appraised by
the Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of our common stock, exclusive of any
elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the court. Stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares are in any
case encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights due to the complexity of the
appraisal process. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in additional detail in this proxy
statement in the section captioned “The Merger — Appraisal Rights,” and the relevant section of the DGCL regarding appraisal
rights is reproduced in Annex C to this proxy statement.

Q: Do any of the Company’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of the Company
stockholders generally?

A: In considering the recommendation of the Board with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have
interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of stockholders generally. The Board was aware of
these interests and considered them at the time the Board approved the Merger Agreement and made its recommendation to the
Company stockholders. For more information, see the section captioned “The Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

Q: What will happen to the Company directors following the Merger?

A: If the Merger is consummated, all members of our Board will cease to be members of the Board at the effective time of the
Merger. The Merger Agreement provides that, at the effective time of the Merger, the directors of Sub immediately prior to
Effective Time will become the directors of the Surviving Corporation.

Q: Who can help answer my questions?

A: If you have any questions concerning the Merger, the Special Meeting or this proxy statement, would like additional copies of
this proxy statement or need help voting your shares of our common stock, please contact our Proxy Solicitor (as defined in the
section captioned “The Special Meeting — Solicitation of Proxies”):

RISK FACTORS
 

Risks Relating to the Pending Merger

If the proposed Merger is not consummated, our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline.

The consummation of the Merger is conditioned upon, among other things, the adoption of the Merger Agreement by our
stockholders and other customary closing conditions. Therefore, the Merger may not be consummated or may not be consummated
in a timely manner. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of our common stock will likely decline. In addition,
our stock price may decline as a result of the fact that we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses related to the
Merger prior to its closing that will not be recovered if the Merger is not consummated. If the Merger Agreement is terminated
under certain circumstances as described below under “The Merger Agreement — Company Termination Fee” we may be obligated
to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee of $11 million. As a consequence of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, as
well as of some or all of these potential effects of the termination of the Merger Agreement, our business could be harmed in that
concerns about our viability are likely to increase, making it more difficult to retain employees and existing customers and to
generate new business.

The fact that there is a Merger pending could harm our business, revenue and results of operations.

While the Merger is pending, it creates uncertainty about our future. As a result of this uncertainty, customers may decide to
delay, defer, or cancel purchases of our products pending consummation of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. If
these decisions represent a significant portion of our anticipated revenue, our results of operations and quarterly revenues could be
substantially below the expectations of investors.

In addition, while the Merger is pending, we are subject to a number of risks that may harm our business, revenue and
results of operations, including:

• the diversion of management and employee attention and the unavoidable disruption to our relationships with customers
and vendors may detract from our ability to grow revenues and minimize costs;

• we have and will continue to incur significant expenses related to the Merger prior to its closing;

• it may be difficult for us to retain employees due to the announcement and pendency of the Merger; and

• we may be unable to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities.

Our executive officers may have interests in the Merger other than, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders
generally.

Members of our Board and our executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or are in addition to,
the interests of our stockholders generally. Our Board was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in
approving the Merger Agreement. You should keep this in mind when considering the recommendation of the Board in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement. These interests include the treatment of outstanding equity awards upon consummation of the
Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the vesting or delivery of outstanding equity awards and payments that may come due
in connection with a change of control, which will occur upon the consummation of the Merger, under the Company’s Amended
and Restated Executive Officer Severance Plan, and the continuation of indemnification obligations and directors’ and officers’
insurance for former and continuing officers and directors.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Litigation has been instituted against the Company and members of the Board, challenging the Merger, and adverse
judgments in these lawsuits or any other may prevent the Merger from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or
at all.

The Company and members of the Board have been named as defendants in four class action lawsuits challenging the Merger.
If the plaintiffs in these or any other actions that may be brought are successful, these adverse judgments may prevent the parties
from completing the Merger in the expected timeframe, if at all. Even if the plaintiffs in these potential actions are not successful,
the costs of defending against such claims could adversely affect the financial condition of the Company and such actions could
adversely affect the reputation of the Company and members of the Board or management. See “The Merger — Litigation Related
to the Merger” for a discussion of these legal proceedings.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SPECIAL MEETING

The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board for use at the Special Meeting.

Date, Time and Place

We will hold the Special Meeting on September 12, 2017, at 8:00 a.m., Pacific Time, at West Marine Support Center located at
500 Westridge Drive, Watsonville, California 95076-4100.

Purpose of the Special Meeting

At the Special Meeting, we will ask stockholders to vote on proposals to: (i) adopt the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1); (ii)
consider a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s
named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger (Proposal 2); and (iii) adjourn the Special Meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement (Proposal 3).
You will also at the Special Meeting be asked to transact such other business as may properly come before the Special Meeting or
any adjournment or postponement thereof.

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum

Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to
vote at the Special Meeting. A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be available at West Marine Support
Center located at 500 Westridge Drive, Watsonville, California 95076-4100, during regular business hours for a period of no less
than ten days before the Special Meeting and at the place of the Special Meeting during the meeting.

As of the Record Date, there were 25,274,566 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the
Special Meeting. The presence at the Special Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of 12,637,284 shares of our common
stock, representing a majority of the shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting,
constitutes a quorum for the Special Meeting.

If you are a Company stockholder of record and you vote by mail, by telephone or through the Internet or in person at the
Special Meeting, then your shares of our common stock will be counted as part of the quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of
shares of our common stock and you provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will be
counted in determining the presence of a quorum. If you are a “street name” holder of shares and you do not provide your bank,
broker or other nominee with voting instructions, then your shares will not be counted as present in determining the presence of a
quorum.

All shares of our common stock held by stockholders of record that are present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to
vote at the Special Meeting, regardless of how such shares are voted or whether such stockholders abstain from voting, will be
counted in determining the presence of a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the Special Meeting may be adjourned.

Vote Required for Approval

Adoption of the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1).  If a quorum is present, the adoption of the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1)
requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote on such
matter.

Advisory Vote regarding Merger-Related Compensation (Proposal 2).  If a quorum is present, approval, by non-binding,
advisory vote, of certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers that is
based on or otherwise relates to the Merger requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes casts on such proposal at the
Special Meeting.

Adjournment or Postponement of the Special Meeting (Proposal 3).  Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the
Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes casts on such
proposal at the Special Meeting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Randolph K. Repass, his spouse and certain of the Repass family
trusts, which beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock as
of that date, entered into the Voting Agreement with Parent and Sub. Certain other Repass family trusts, which beneficially owned
shares of our common stock but were not able to deliver their signature pages concurrently with the execution of the Merger
Agreement, signed the Voting Agreement on the following day, June 30, 2017, which increased the total issued and outstanding
shares of our common stock subject to the Voting Agreement to approximately 24% as of June 30, 2017 and approximately 24% as
of the Record Date. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, they agreed, among other things, during the period beginning on the date of
the Voting Agreement and ending on its termination date set forth therein, to vote in favor of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes

The proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1) requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote on such matter. Therefore, the failure to vote or the abstention from voting
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

The proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the
Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger (Proposal 2), requires the affirmative vote
of the majority of the votes cast on such proposal at the Special Meeting. Consequently, abstentions and failure to vote your shares
will have no effect on this proposal.

The proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the Merger Agreement at the time of the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present (Proposal 3), requires
the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast on such proposal at the Special Meeting. Consequently, abstentions and failure
to vote your shares will have no effect on this proposal.

All of the proposals in this proxy statement are non-routine matters, so there can be no broker non-votes at the Special Meeting.
A broker non-vote occurs when shares held by a bank, broker or other nominee are represented at a meeting, but the bank, broker or
other nominee has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and does not have the discretion to direct the voting
of the shares on a particular proposal. Accordingly, if your shares are held in “street name,” your bank, broker or other nominee
will NOT be able to vote your shares of our common stock on any of the proposals, and your shares will not be counted as present
in determining the presence of a quorum, unless you have properly instructed your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote.
Because Proposal 1 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the failure to provide
your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” Proposal 1. Because
the approval of each of Proposal 2 and Proposal 3 requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast on such proposal at
the Special Meeting, and because your bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on either
proposal, the failure to provide your bank, broker or other nominee with voting instructions will have no effect on each such
proposal.

Shares Held by the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers

As of the Record Date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate,
6,790,835 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 27% of the total shares of our common stock outstanding on
the Record Date. Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Randolph K. Repass, his spouse and certain of the
Repass family trusts, which beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of our
common stock as of that date, entered into the Voting Agreement with Parent and Sub. Certain other Repass family trusts, which
beneficially owned shares of our common stock but were not able to deliver their signature pages concurrently with the execution
of the Merger Agreement, signed the Voting Agreement on the following day, June 30, 2017, which increased the total issued and
outstanding shares of our common stock subject to the Voting Agreement to approximately 24% as of June 30, 2017 and
approximately 24% as of the Record Date. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement they agreed, among other things, during the period
beginning on the date of

the Voting Agreement and ending on the termination date set forth therein, (i) to vote in favor of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) on certain restrictions in the transfer of their shares of our common stock,
and (iii) to vote against any or agreement which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent, delay or adversely
affect the Merger Agreement or the Merger.

Voting of Proxies

If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, LLC, you may cause your
shares to be voted by returning a signed and dated proxy card in the accompanying prepaid envelope, or you may vote in person at
the Special Meeting. Additionally, you may grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone by following the
instructions on your proxy card. You must have the enclosed proxy card available, and follow the instructions on the proxy card, in
order to grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone. Based on your proxy cards or Internet and telephone proxies,
the proxy holders will vote your shares according to your directions.

If you plan to attend the Special Meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be given a ballot at the Special Meeting. If your
shares are registered in your name, you are encouraged to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person. If
you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any previously submitted proxy.

Voting instructions are included on your proxy card. All shares represented by properly signed and dated proxies received in
time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in accordance with the instructions of the stockholder. Properly
signed and dated proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted (i) “FOR” the Adoption of the Merger Agreement
(Proposal 1); (ii) “FOR” the Advisory Vote regarding Merger-Related Compensation (Proposal 2); and (iii) “FOR” the
Adjournment or Postponement of the Special Meeting (Proposal 3).

If your shares are held in “street name” through a bank, broker or other nominee, you may vote through your bank, broker or
other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee or attending the
Special Meeting and voting in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee. If such a service is provided,
you may vote over the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee by following the instructions on the voting
form provided by your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not return the voting form provided by your bank, broker or other
nominee, do not vote via the Internet or telephone through your bank, broker or other nominee, if possible, or do not attend the
Special Meeting and vote in person with a “legal proxy” from your bank, broker or other nominee, it will have the same effect as if
you voted “AGAINST” Proposal 1, but will have no effect on Proposal 2 or Proposal 3.

Revocability of Proxies

If you are a stockholder of record on the Record Date, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is
voted at the Special Meeting by:

• signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting;

• submitting a new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy;

• delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or

• attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

If you have submitted a proxy, your appearance at the Special Meeting, in the absence of voting in person or submitting an
additional proxy or revocation, will not have the effect of revoking your prior proxy.

If you hold your shares of our common stock in “street name,” you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee for
instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy”
from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Any adjournment, postponement or other delay of the Special Meeting, including for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies, will allow stockholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the Special
Meeting, as adjourned, postponed or delayed.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Board’ Recommendation

The Board, after considering the various factors described in the section captioned “The Merger —  Recommendation of the
Board and Reasons for the Merger,” has unanimously (i) adopted and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) approved the
execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (iii) determined that the Merger Agreement, and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, and (iv) recommended that the Company stockholders of the Company adopt the Merger Agreement and directed that
the Merger Agreement be submitted to the Company stockholders for adoption.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (Proposal 1),
“FOR” the approval, by a non-binding advisory vote, of the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the
Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger (Proposal 2) and “FOR” the
proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting if necessary or appropriate, as determined by the Company, to solicit additional
proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement (Proposal 3).

Solicitation of Proxies

The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. We have retained D.F. King & Co., Inc., a proxy solicitation
firm (the “Proxy Solicitor”) to solicit proxies in connection with the Special Meeting at a cost of $11,500, plus expenses. We will
also indemnify the Proxy Solicitor against losses arising out of its provisions of these services on our behalf. In addition, we may
reimburse banks, brokers and other nominees representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding soliciting
materials to such beneficial owners. Proxies may also be solicited by our directors, officers and employees, personally or by
telephone, email, fax, over the Internet or other means of communication. No additional compensation will be paid for such
services.

Anticipated Date of Consummation of the Merger

Assuming timely satisfaction of necessary closing conditions, including the approval by stockholders of the proposal to adopt
the Merger Agreement, we anticipate that the Merger will be consummated in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.

Appraisal Rights

If the Merger is consummated, stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement, who
continuously hold their shares of our common stock through the Effective Time, and who properly demand appraisal of their shares
of our common stock in compliance with the requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL are entitled to exercise appraisal rights in
connection with the Merger under Section 262. This means that holders of shares of our common stock who may exercise appraisal
rights and who also have properly exercised, perfected and not lost such appraisal rights are entitled to have their shares appraised
by the Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of their shares of our common stock, exclusive of any
elements of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with interest to be paid on the amount
determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Court of Chancery, so long as such holders comply exactly with the
procedures established by Section 262.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Due to the complexity of the appraisal process, stockholders who wish to seek appraisal of their shares of our common
stock are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights. Stockholders
considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 262
could be more than, the same as or less than the value of the Merger Consideration.

To exercise your appraisal rights, you must follow exactly the procedures specified under the DGCL, including (i) delivering a
written demand for appraisal to the Company before the vote is taken on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) not submitting a proxy or otherwise voting in favor of the proposal
to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby; and (iii) continuing to
hold your shares of our common stock of record through the Effective Time. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified
under the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank,
brokerage firm or other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, brokerage firm or
other nominee to determine the appropriate procedures for the making of a demand for appraisal by such bank, brokerage firm or
nominee. The DGCL requirements for exercising appraisal rights are described in further detail in this proxy statement in the
section captioned “The Merger — Appraisal Rights,” and Section 262 regarding appraisal rights is reproduced and attached as
Annex C to this proxy statement.

Other Matters

At this time, we know of no other matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting. If any other matters properly come before the
Special Meeting, your shares of our common stock will be voted in accordance with the discretion of the appointed proxy holders.

Householding of Special Meeting Materials

received at your household and helps to reduce our expenses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROPOSAL 1: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT

We are asking you to adopt the Merger Agreement.

For a summary of and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the Merger Agreement
throughout this proxy statement, including the information set forth in the sections captioned “The Merger” and “The Merger
Agreement.” A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. You are urged to read the Merger
Agreement carefully in its entirety.

Under applicable law, we cannot consummate the Merger without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of our common stock voting in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement. If you abstain from voting,
fail to cast your vote, in person or by proxy, or fail to give voting instructions to your brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, it
will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY, NON-BINDING VOTE TO APPROVE
CERTAIN MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act of 2010, requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the
payment of certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers that is based on
or otherwise relates to the Merger, as disclosed in the section captioned “The Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute Compensation.”

We are asking stockholders to indicate their approval of the various compensation that may be paid or become payable to the
Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger. These payments are set forth in the section
captioned “The Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute
Compensation” and the accompanying footnotes. In general, the various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these
compensation payments may be made have previously formed part of the Company’s overall compensation program for our named
executive officers and previously have been disclosed to stockholders as part of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and
related sections of our annual proxy statements. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation
and Leadership Development Committee of the Board, which is composed solely of non-management directors, and are believed to
be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.

Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the Special Meeting:

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of West Marine, Inc. approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation that may
be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as
disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned “The Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors
and Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute Compensation” in the Company’s proxy statement for the Special
Meeting.”

Stockholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to consummation of the Merger, and as an advisory vote, the
result will not be binding on the Company, the Board or Parent. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in
nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the
Merger is consummated, our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or otherwise
relates to the Merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROPOSAL 3: ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger at the time of the Special Meeting. If stockholders
approve the adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the Special Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use
the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including proxies from stockholders that have previously returned properly
executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal
could mean that, even if we had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the Merger
Agreement such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special Meeting
without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to
vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not
present or otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.

The Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Effect on the Company if the Merger is Not Consummated

If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, the
Company stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock. Instead, the Company will remain an
independent public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ and registered under the
Exchange Act, and we will continue to file periodic and current reports with the SEC. In addition, if the Merger is not
consummated, we expect that management will operate the business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today
and that stockholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including
risks related to the highly competitive industry in which the Company operates and risks related to adverse economic conditions.

Furthermore, if the Merger is not consummated, and depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be
consummated, the price of our common stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price
of our common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

Accordingly, if the Merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the
future value of your shares of our common stock. If the Merger is not consummated, the Board will continue to evaluate and review
the Company’s business operations, strategic direction and capitalization, among other things, and will make such changes as are
deemed appropriate. If the Merger Agreement is not adopted by stockholders or if the Merger is not consummated for any other
reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Board will be offered or that the Company’s business,
prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.

In addition, the Company may be required to pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee of $11 million if the Merger
Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances. For more information, please see the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement — Company Termination Fee.”

Merger Consideration

At the Effective Time, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including any shares resulting from the exercise of Options or settlement of RSUs which become vested as of the consummation
of the Merger, but excluding the Cancelled Shares and the Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and automatically converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration of $12.97 in cash, without interest, and subject to deduction for any required
withholding tax. At the Effective Time, each Cancelled Share will be automatically canceled without payment of any consideration.
Each Dissenting Share will not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, unless and until such stockholder fails
to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such stockholder’s right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, at which time
each such share of our common stock will be converted into and will be exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of
the Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal is irrevocably lost, the Merger Consideration. The Dissenting Shares
shall be treated in accordance with Section 262, as more fully described in the section captioned “The Merger — Appraisal Rights.”

Background of the Merger

The Board and management regularly review and evaluate our results of operations, financial position, business strategy and
growth opportunities, as well as the trends and conditions affecting our industry and business generally. As part of its evaluation,
the Board has, from time to time, considered a variety of strategic alternatives to the Company’s business strategies as an
independent company, including consideration of potential strategic and financial alternatives to maximize stockholder value, such
as business combinations, acquisitions and financing transactions.

On May 26, 2016, the Board received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal letter from Monomoy, offering to acquire 100% of
the Company’s issued and outstanding shares for a price per share in cash of $10.25. On May 26, 2016, the closing price of our
common stock was $9.01.

On June 3, 2016, the Company sent a letter to Monomoy confirming receipt of the proposal, noting that the Board would
review it and the Company would get back to Monomoy with the outcome of that review.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On June 7, 2016, the Board held a meeting to consider, among other things, Monomoy’s proposal. Members of the Company’s
management as well as representatives of Sidley Austin LLP (“Sidley”), the Company’s outside counsel, participated in the
meeting. At the meeting, representatives of Sidley outlined the fiduciary duties of the Board in considering an offer such as
Monomoy’s proposal and generally in connection with engaging in a process that might result in a change of control of the
Company. Following the discussion, the Board unanimously determined that the price per share included in Monomoy’s proposal
did not provide meaningful incremental value relative to the Company’s stock price and the Company’s standalone prospects that
would justify pursuing the proposal at that time. The Board also instructed management to work with Sidley to prepare a response
letter to Monomoy on behalf of the Board.

On June 14, 2016, the Company sent a letter to Monomoy indicating that the Board had carefully considered Monomoy’s
proposal and unanimously agreed that it was not one that the Company should explore.

On July 7, 2016, the Board received a second non-binding proposal letter from Monomoy, offering to acquire 100% of the
Company’s issued and outstanding shares for a price per share in cash of $10.50.

On July 8, 2016, Matthew Hyde, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Jeffrey Lasher, its Chief Financial Officer, and
Pamela Fields, its General Counsel, Barbara L. Rambo, the chair of the Board, and representatives of Sidley held a meeting, during
which the parties present discussed Monomoy’s revised offer. In light of the Board’s views as discussed at the June 7, 2016
meeting, it was the consensus of the group that while the Board was unlikely to be interested in pursuing Monomoy’s revised
proposal, it would nonetheless be worthwhile to provide Monomoy with an opportunity to elaborate on its proposal. However,
given that management was busy with closing the quarter and preparing for the earnings release and Form 10-Q filing, and also was
deep in the process of completing its annual strategic plan for the Board’s review at the upcoming Board meeting, the best course of
action at that time was to defer any formal response to Monomoy regarding its proposal until after the Board had an opportunity to
review in detail the Company’s annual strategic plan at the upcoming Board meeting, but to continue engagement with Monomoy.
It was agreed that Ms. Rambo should confirm the proposed approach with the other members of the Board.

Ms. Rambo subsequently confirmed with the other members of the Board that they agreed with that approach. Management
then sent a letter to Monomoy stating that the Company would arrange a meeting, to occur after the Company issued its earnings
release for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, between representatives of Monomoy and Messrs. Hyde and Lasher for the
purpose of enabling Monomoy to further elaborate on and discuss its proposal.

On August 16, 2016, Messrs. Hyde and Lasher met with representatives of Monomoy. During that meeting, Monomoy
expressed its continued interest in acquiring the Company and suggested that the parties could enter into a non-disclosure
agreement and engage in a due diligence review of the Company in furtherance of acquisition discussions. Mr. Hyde responded that
he would discuss that with the Board at its next meeting.

Beginning on August 30 through September 1, 2016, the Board held its regularly scheduled three-day meeting at which
members of management of the Company were in attendance. Management presented and discussed with the Board the Company’s
annual strategic plan. Representatives of Sidley participated in a portion of the meeting on September 1, 2016, during which they
made a presentation to the Board regarding certain legal considerations relevant to the Company remaining as a standalone public
company versus exploring a potential business combination transaction, in light of Monomoy’s proposals received by the Board,
and also discussed the fiduciary duties of the Board under Delaware law in the context of a potential business combination
transaction. The Board then discussed Monomoy’s revised proposal and the Company’s possible responses. Following the
discussion, the Board unanimously resolved to reject Monomoy’s revised proposal as inadequate, determined that entry into a non-
disclosure agreement and conducting due diligence was not advisable at the time and instructed management to work with Ms.
Rambo to develop a response to Monomoy. While the Board decided to reject Monomoy’s proposal as inadequate, the Board also
decided that it should select a financial advisor to help it consider whether it might be an opportune time for the Company to
explore various strategic options, including a sale of the Company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On September 12, 2016, Monomoy sent a third unsolicited, non-binding proposal letter to the Board, offering to acquire 100%
of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares for a price per share in cash of $10.75.

On September 13, 2016, the Company sent a letter to Monomoy stating that the Board had considered Monomoy’s July 7
proposal at a recent meeting and had unanimously determined that the July 7 proposal did not present an opportunity that was in the
best interest of the Company to explore. The letter also noted that the Company had received the September 12 proposal, which
would be forwarded to the Board and considered by the Board at its next Board meeting. The Company’s letter also stated that the
Board had considered Monomoy’s request to enter into a non-disclosure agreement, but the Board was in the process of reviewing
the management’s long-term strategic plans and, as such, the Board had determined that entering into a non-disclosure agreement
with Monomoy would be premature. The letter further stated that if, in the context of its review, the Board decided to pursue
strategic alternatives, the Board would revisit Monomoy’s request.

On September 15, 2016, the Board held a meeting during which Mr. Hyde provided an update on Monomoy’s latest proposal.
The Board discussed and approved the formation of a new subcommittee of the Board that would be administratively easier to
convene, to pursue the evaluation of strategic alternatives, subject to approving a charter for the subcommittee by written consent to
be circulated to the Board members. The Board decided to defer the review of Monomoy’s third proposal letter until the Board
engaged a financial advisor.

On September 19, 2016, the Board approved, by unanimous written consent, the formation of a subcommittee of the Board (the
“Strategic Committee”), consisting of Ms. Rambo (chair), Robert D. Olsen, Alice M. Richter and Christiana Shi, each an
independent director and member of the Company’s audit and finance committee of the Board. The Strategic Committee was
authorized to, among other things, establish and direct the process of reviewing and evaluating strategic alternatives, solicit
proposals, review and negotiate the terms and conditions of strategic alternatives.

On September 23, 2016, the Strategic Committee held a meeting, in which Ms. Fields and a representative of Sidley
participated. The Strategic Committee discussed the process with Monomoy, including their third proposal letter received on
September 12, 2016 and the Company’s letter sent to Monomoy on September 13, 2016 in response to the July 7 proposal.
Following the discussion, the Strategic Committee determined that the committee and the Board should defer any action in
response to Monomoy’s proposal until after engagement of a financial advisor and further review and consideration of the strategic
and financial plans to be prepared by management.

On September 27, 2016, Monomoy reached out via email to Mr. Repass requesting a brief phone call. Mr. Repass responded on
September 30, 2016 declining to take such a call and noting that the Company would be in touch with Monomoy after the Board
had an opportunity to consider whether to pursue strategic alternatives.

On October 7, 2016, the Strategic Committee held a meeting that was also attended by members of the Company’s senior
management. At the invitation of the committee, two financial advisory firms, including Guggenheim, participated in a portion of
the meeting and each made a presentation to the Strategic Committee regarding their capabilities and relevant experience.
Following the presentations, the Strategic Committee discussed each financial advisory firm’s experience in the retail industry and
relevant transactions, approaches to strategic alternatives, geographic location and other considerations. Following the discussion,
and with input from management, the Strategic Committee selected Guggenheim as the financial advisor to the Board and
recommended the engagement to the Board for approval.

On October 10, 2016, the Board held a meeting, in which members of the senior management of the Company and a
representative of Sidley participated. The Board reviewed the recommendation of the Strategic Committee to engage Guggenheim
as its financial advisor, discussed and approved the engagement and delegated to the Strategic Committee the authority to negotiate
and finalize the engagement letter with Guggenheim. The Strategic Committee subsequently finalized the engagement letter, and
the Company and Guggenheim entered into the engagement letter with Guggenheim.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On November 4, 2016, the Strategic Committee held a meeting, in which members of the senior management of the Company
and representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley participated. The committee, management of the Company and Guggenheim
discussed the initial steps to be taken in the Board’s review of potential strategic alternatives, including a review of the business and
management’s strategic and financial plans, the development of a list of potentially interested parties to be contacted in connection
with a potential strategic transaction and the development of a financial model with management that would include detailed
assumptions and forecasts typically expected from potential buyers. The participants in the meeting discussed the next steps in
considering the exploration of the strategic transaction and an engagement strategy with Monomoy.

Following the November 4 meeting and continuing through February 2017, management and Guggenheim worked together on
the matters as directed by the Strategic Committee, including the review of the management’s strategic and financial plans,
development of a financial model, creation of an online data room and development of a list of potentially interested parties to be
contacted.

On November 29 and 30, 2016, the Board held its regularly scheduled meeting. Representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley
participated in the meeting on November 30, 2016. Representatives of Guggenheim gave a presentation on the status of its
preliminary review of the strategic options and valuation of the Company, including actions that might be taken by the Company if
it decided to remain as a standalone public company in order to increase value to its stockholders. The Board and Guggenheim
discussed the next steps in potentially pursuing a sale process, including assessing the level of interest in the Company from
potential buyers and management’s continued development of a financial model to be used in further consideration of strategic
alternatives and that would be provided to potential counterparties. The Board authorized Guggenheim to reach out to a limited
number of parties that would be most interested in pursuing a potential acquisition of the Company to make an initial assessment of
the level of interest that might exist for the potential acquisition of the Company to assist the Board in its evaluation of whether to
launch a full bidding process.

Beginning in early December 2016 and continuing through mid-January 2017, at the direction of the Board, Guggenheim and
members of the Company’s management engaged in a limited outreach to potentially interested parties, including both strategic and
financial buyers, and, in some cases, held initial meetings, to gauge market interest in, and perceived obstacles to, an acquisition of
the Company.

On December 9, 2016, the Company received a proposal letter from a strategic party (“Party A”), offering to acquire all of the
Company’s issued and outstanding shares for a price per share in cash of $11.50. Following that submission and prior to December
20, 2016, Guggenheim engaged in a series of discussions with Party A regarding the proposal and informed Party A that the
Company was considering a sale process. Party A indicated that it was not interested in participating in a process.

On December 16, 2016, the Strategic Committee held a meeting, in which members of the Company’s management and
representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley participated. Representatives of Guggenheim updated the Strategic Committee on the
status of communications with Party A and Monomoy. The Strategic Committee discussed the proposal from Party A, noting that it
was not at a preemptive value that would justify pursuing a negotiated transaction with Party A given the value that Guggenheim
believed could be achieved through a broader bidding process. Guggenheim was directed to explore with Party A whether they
would increase their offer and to keep Monomoy interested in engaging in a sale process.

Between the Strategic Committee meeting and December 20, 2016, Guggenheim had a series of discussions with Party A, in
which Guggenheim informed Party A that a proposal of $11.50 per share was not at a level that would dissuade the Company from
pursuing a process. Party A submitted a revised proposal letter on December 20, 2016, offering to acquire all of the Company’s
issued and outstanding shares for a price per share in cash of $14.00.

On December 21, 2016, the Strategic Committee held a meeting, in which members of the senior management and
representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley participated. A representative of Guggenheim discussed the conversations he had had
with the Chief Executive Officer of Party A regarding its revised proposal. After discussion, the Strategic Committee determined
that the Company should enter into a

non-disclosure agreement with Party A, respond to Party A’s request for diligence information and agree to a meeting between
Party A and the Company’s management. The committee then discussed the next course of action in the coming weeks, including
continuing exploration of potential interest in an acquisition of the Company and finalizing management’s financial model for
review by the Strategic Committee and the Board.

Following the Strategic Committee meeting, the Company and Party A entered into a non-disclosure agreement and Party A
engaged in initial diligence activities, including meeting with the Company’s management and founder, and reviewing confidential
diligence materials, regarding the business.

On January 13, 2017, the Strategic Committee held a meeting, in which members of the senior management and representatives
of Guggenheim and Sidley participated. Representatives of Guggenheim and Mr. Hyde updated the committee on the status of the
initial sales process outreach as well as the status of activities with Party A, including an upcoming in-person meeting with certain
executive officers of Party A to discuss an overview of the business and opportunities and possible synergies from a business
combination.

Following that in-person meeting, Party A informed Guggenheim on January 17, 2017 that Party A would not continue to
pursue its non-binding proposal to acquire the Company at a price per share of $14, but remained interested at a price closer to its
initial $11.50 offer and still did not wish to participate in a sale process. Party A and Guggenheim noted that they should stay in
contact.

On January 27, 2017, the Strategic Committee held a meeting, in which members of the senior management and representatives
of Guggenheim and Sidley participated. Representatives of Guggenheim presented the Strategic Committee with a summary status
report, noting that of the 22 parties contacted to date, six parties had declined to engage in discussions and, of the remaining parties,
nine had engaged in initial meetings (including Party A). Guggenheim and Mr. Hyde reported differing levels of interest and
perspectives on the Company’s strategies from the contacted parties and discussed the in-person meeting with Party A and their
subsequent communication on price and process. Guggenheim proposed a list of additional parties to contact. The Strategic
Committee reviewed and discussed the additional parties, including potential strategic and financial buyers that the Strategic
Committee and Guggenheim believed would be most interested in pursuing an acquisition of the Company, and decided that the
financial model should be finalized before seeking additional proposals from potential interested parties.

On February 10, 2017, the Strategic Committee held a meeting, in which members of the senior management and
representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley participated. Members of the Company’s management team presented the five-year
financial model they had been working on developing over the last several months for use in connection with the sale process.
Management and the committee discussed, among other things, the key assumptions underlying the model, various risks that could
impact achievement of the results set forth in the model and different components of the model. Representatives of Guggenheim
provided a process update and discussed proposed next steps, including reaching out to additional parties as discussed at the
January 27 meeting, entering into non-disclosure agreements, providing access to diligence materials, including the model, and
distributing first round bid procedure letters. After further discussing the financial model and proposed next steps, the committee
approved the model as presented for use in the sale process and directed Guggenheim to proceed with the proposed next steps in
the process as outlined at the meeting, including reaching out to the remaining potential parties as discussed.

Following that meeting, Guggenheim began contacting additional parties providing a form of non-disclosure agreement to
parties who had expressed interest but had not already entered into a non-disclosure agreement with the Company.

Since the formation of the Strategic Committee, Ms. Rambo frequently updated other members of the Board as to developments
in the strategic alternatives evaluation process and the Board was updated on the Strategic Committee’s work at each meeting of the
Board. In light of the increased momentum in the process, the Strategic Committee determined that all members of the Board
would be invited to attend and participate in the Strategic Committee meetings beginning with the February 24, 2017 meeting of
the Strategic Committee. Ms. Rambo continued to update other members of the Board who did not attend the Strategic Committee
meetings and the Board continued to be updated on the Strategic Committee’s work at each meeting of the Board.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On February 24, 2017, the Strategic Committee held a meeting, in which Mr. Randolph K. Repass, founder of the Company and
one of the Board members, Ms. Fields, and representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley participated. Representatives of
Guggenheim reported that a total of 49 potential interested parties had been contacted to date, three of which had executed non-
disclosure agreements and ten of which had passed on the opportunity. Guggenheim and the committee discussed the list of parties
who remained interested and proposed next steps of contacting those parties as well as continued efforts to reach out to the
remaining parties as discussed at the February 10, 2017 meeting. The Strategic Committee then reviewed a proposed confidential
information memorandum and bid instruction letter prepared by Guggenheim and, following discussion, authorized Guggenheim to
share the confidential information memorandum with parties who executed a non-disclosure agreement and to proceed with the
distribution of bid instruction letters.

On March 2, 2017, representatives of Party A and Guggenheim had a conversation in which Party A stated that it did not want
to participate in a process or receive the confidential information memorandum.

Between March 9 and 16, 2017, Guggenheim sent process letters to 20 potential buyers, including Monomoy, instructing each
buyer to submit its proposal no later than March 28, 2017.

On March 10, 2017, the Strategic Committee held a meeting, in which Mr. Repass, members of the senior management and
representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley participated. Representatives of Guggenheim provided an update on the potential
bidders and the process timeline, noting that a total of 78 potential interested parties had been contacted to date, 32 of which had
passed on the opportunity.

On March 22 and 23, 2017, the Board held its regularly-scheduled meeting. Representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley
participated in a portion of the meeting on March 23, 2017. Representatives of Guggenheim provided an update on the potential
sale of the Company and the bidding process, including a market update, a discussion of the financial model prepared by
management and provided to potential bidders following the Strategic Committee’s review, a preliminary financial analysis, an
analysis on the impact of a potential dividend payment by the Company on the process and a review of the proposed overall
timeline of the process going forward. Guggenheim reported that a total of 79 parties had been contacted to date (including 16
strategic parties (including Party A, which Guggenheim noted continued to seem to be interested in talking with Guggenheim
regarding the opportunity notwithstanding their prior statements) and 63 financial parties), 22 of which had executed a non-
disclosure agreement, with three of those having passed on the opportunity. It was noted that more information on the status of the
process would be known on March 28, 2017 when bids were due. Following discussion regarding various considerations relating to
declaring a cash dividend, the Board approved the Company declaring a cash dividend of $0.05 per share on issued and outstanding
shares of our common stock.

On March 24, 2017, the Company announced that the Board declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share, which was paid on
May 25, 2017 to the Company stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 11, 2017.

Throughout the process, Guggenheim contacted a total of 79 parties and the Company entered into non-disclosure agreements
with a total of 22 counterparties (including Monomoy and Parties A through F below), who were provided access to an online data
room containing information related to the Company and its business. All of the executed non-disclosure agreements contained a
standstill provision, which ceased to apply to these counterparties upon the Company’s entering into the Merger Agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On March 28, 2017, six potential financial buyers, including Monomoy, submitted non-binding initial indications of interest.
Each potential buyer submitted a non-binding all-cash offer to acquire the outstanding shares of our common stock. The table
below presents the ranges of per share prices reflected by the indications of interest received:

 
Bidder  Price Per Share Range
Monomoy   $11.50 – $13.50  
Party B   $11.80 – $12.30  
Party C   $12.00  
Party D   $11.50 – $12.50*  
Party E   $11.00 – $12.00  
Party F   $12.00  

* Party D offered to acquire 85% of the Company’s shares in cash for $11.50 to $12.50 per share in cash, with the remaining 15%
of the Company’s shares held by management and Mr. Repass to be rolled over.

On March 31, 2017, the Strategic Committee and the rest of the Board members met to review the preliminary indications of
interest. Mr. Hyde and Ms. Fields were in attendance as well as representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley. Guggenheim presented
the six bids received. After discussing the bids and potential responses to these bidders, the Board instructed Guggenheim to
provide feedback to each bidder, noting that the Company would continue the process with each bidder, but in order for an offer to
be considered by the Board, the proposed per share price would need to be above $12.

Following the meeting, Guggenheim contacted each bidder on March 31, 2017, noting that each would be invited to a
management presentation with the Company, the Company had received a number of bids with a price per share at or above $12
and the Company was not inviting bidders to continue in the process unless they understood that the per share price proposed by
their bids would need to be above $12.

Over the course of April, management of the Company held in-person management presentations with five of the six bidders
and a telephonic presentation with the sixth bidder, with representatives of Guggenheim in attendance at each meeting and in the
case of Monomoy, with its financial advisor in attendance or on the phone. Through their submission of bids, or, if earlier, their
withdrawal from the process, the bidders continued to conduct due diligence of the Company and its business, including through
diligence meetings with the Company’s management team and Mr. Repass, at which representatives of Guggenheim were present,
and to discuss their participation in the process with Guggenheim.

On April 20, 2017, Guggenheim had calls with the Chief Executive Officer of Party A and subsequently with the financial
advisor to Party A, advising Party A that the Company had received multiple indications of interest with proposed purchase prices
higher than Party A’s last proposed price of $11.50. Party A expressed an interest in entering the process, noting that it would
consider a transaction structure of a combination of cash and stock valued at $12 per share. Guggenheim informed Party A that
Party A should engage in due diligence.

On April 21, 2017, the Strategic Committee held a meeting, in which Mr. Repass, members of senior management and
representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley participated. The Strategic Committee received an update from management and
Guggenheim regarding the sale process. Representatives of Guggenheim also reported on their discussion with Party A on the
preceding day. Guggenheim noted that it would be following up with each bidder directly on whether they were still interested in
pursuing and to discuss next steps.

On May 8, 2017, representatives of Party A informed representatives of Guggenheim that Party A was not able to proceed in
the process at that time.

On May 15, 2017, Party E notified Guggenheim of its decision to withdraw from the process, indicating that it would not be
able to complete a transaction at this point given its internal resource constraints.

On May 17, 2017, Guggenheim sent the second round bid letters to the remaining five bidders, instructing each bidder to
provide a revised indication of interest by June 13, 2017.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On May 19, 2017, the Strategic Committee held a meeting, in which Mr. Repass and Dennis Madsen, two members of the
Board, members of senior management and representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley participated. The Strategic Committee
received an update from management and Guggenheim regarding the bidding process and the meetings management of the
Company had with the potential bidders. Guggenheim also reported that the second-round bid letters had been distributed
requesting updated proposals by June 13, 2017. A representative of Sidley reviewed a summary of the key terms of the proposed
bid draft merger agreement, previously circulated to the Strategic Committee, including transaction structure, conditions, non-
solicitation restrictions, representations and warranties, covenants, termination rights and termination fees.

On May 22, 2017, the Strategic Committee, with representatives of Sidley and members of management present, met to further
discuss the draft merger agreement and provide guidance to management and Sidley on the proposed terms. The Strategic
Committee instructed the Company and Sidley to finalize the proposed bid draft merger agreement and provide it to the bidders.

On May 25, 2017, the Company posted the bid draft merger agreement in the online data room, making it available to the
bidders remaining in the process.

On May 26, 2017, Party A’s financial advisor contacted Guggenheim, indicating that Party A was interested in re-engaging with
the Company to pursue a transaction in which Mr. Repass would receive Party A equity in exchange for his stock in the Company,
while the other Company stockholders would receive cash consideration. Guggenheim provided Party A with details on the timing
process, including the June 13, 2017 deadline for all bidders to submit their bids.

On May 31, 2017, Guggenheim sent the second-round bid instruction letter to Party A.

On May 31 and June 1, 2017, the Board held its regularly-scheduled meeting. Representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley
participated in a portion of the meeting on June 1, 2017. Guggenheim updated the Board on the latest discussions with Party A and
the cash and stock transaction structure proposed by Party A. Guggenheim then provided an overview of the remaining bidders still
engaged in the process. The Board discussed Party A’s proposed structure and instructed Guggenheim to inform Party A that the
Board strongly preferred a transaction in which all stockholders received the same consideration. The Board also discussed, with
input from a representative of Sidley, the preparation of internal and external communications as well as SEC filing requirements in
connection with a sale transaction.

Shortly after the June 1, 2017 Board meeting and in the following several days, Guggenheim conveyed the Board’s feedback to
Party A and continued the discussions with the representative of Party A.

On June 3, 2017, Party D notified Guggenheim of its decision to withdraw from the process, citing Amazon as a threat to the
brick-and-mortar retail business and indicating concerns over the Company’s performance trends.

On June 8, 2017, Party B notified Guggenheim of its decision to withdraw from the process, citing Amazon as a threat to the
brick-and-mortar retail business.

On June 9, 2017, Party F notified Guggenheim of its decision to withdraw from the process, noting that it would not be in a
position to submit a bid by the June 13, 2017 deadline but would revisit a transaction later if the Company was not able to complete
a transaction within its proposed timeline.

On June 11, 2017, at the request of Party A, representatives of Party A’s outside counsel had a call with representatives of
Sidley and Guggenheim and Ms. Fields in which Party A’s counsel informed them that Party A’s bid would contemplate that Mr.
Repass would receive equity in Party A and that all other Company stockholders would receive cash, and explained the reasons for
that structure. The Sidley representative responded that the Company could not provide a response to this proposed structure until
Party A submitted a bid that included an offer price and further details of the proposed transaction and the Board had an
opportunity to review and consider such proposal.

On June 12, 2017, Guggenheim spoke with Monomoy’s financial advisor, which requested guidance on the Company’s
valuation. Guggenheim further indicated that, while it did not have specific guidance on value,

it believed that, based on the feedback it had received from the Board to date, a deal would likely not be done below the midpoint
of initial range of per share prices included in Monomoy’s March 28 proposal.

Also on June 12, 2017, Guggenheim spoke with Party A’s financial advisor, who asked whether the bid price of $12 orally
proposed by Party A in April would be competitive. Guggenheim responded that, while it did not have definitive proposals in
advance of the June 13, 2017 deadline, a bid price of $12 would likely not be high enough to be competitive based on the feedback
it had received from the Board to date.

On June 13, 2017, Party A advised Guggenheim that Party A was no longer interested in submitting a bid as its proposed $12
price was unlikely to be competitive on valuation and it was not prepared to offer more than $12.

Also on June 13, 2017, Monomoy and Party C each submitted a revised non-binding letter of intent.

Monomoy’s bid contemplated a per share purchase price of $12.21 in cash. The letter of intent indicated that Monomoy would
finance the acquisition with a combination of equity and debt but the transaction would not be subject to any financing contingency.
Monomoy submitted drafts of debt commitment letters and a mark-up of the bid draft merger agreement. Party C’s bid proposed a
per share purchase price of $11.50. The letter of intent indicated that, while Party C would seek to obtain debt financing from third
party lenders, Party C intended to provide an equity commitment for the full purchase price in order to enhance the certainty of the
consummation of a transaction and that Party C’s transaction would not be subject to any financing contingency. Party C also
submitted a mark-up of the bid draft merger agreement.

On June 15, 2017, Guggenheim contacted Monomoy and Party C to obtain additional insight as to the parties’ proposals, noting
that Guggenheim would provide specific feedback following the review of the bids by the Board.

On June 16, 2017, the Board held a telephonic meeting, in which Mr. Repass and Mr. Madsen, as well as members of the senior
management of the Company and representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley participated. Representatives of Guggenheim
summarized the sale process to date, including the bids received, and reviewed and discussed its preliminary financial analysis with
respect to the Company and the two revised bids. Representative of Sidley provided the directors with a refresher overview of their
fiduciary duties under Delaware law with respect to a potential transaction, as previously presented to the Board. A representative
of Sidley also reviewed the key issues contained in the two mark-ups of the bid draft merger agreement provided by Monomoy and
Party C. The Board discussed the strategic alternatives available to the Company, including the bids presented as well as continuing
as a standalone company. Following discussion, the Board decided that the Company should continue to engage in discussions with
the two remaining bidders with an aim of trying to maximize the value offered to stockholders in a potential transaction, taking into
consideration the certainty of the consummation of a transaction proposed by the two bids, and directed Guggenheim to continue to
do so.

Following the meeting on June 16, 2017, a representative of Guggenheim contacted Party C, noting that, while the Board
valued that the bid was not dependent on obtaining debt financing, the bid price of $11.50 was not at a level at which the Board
would approve a transaction, and was not competitive with other interest in the Company. Guggenheim also advised Party C that
the Board had authorized Guggenheim to keep the process open for a limited period of time with an understanding that any
transaction price would be well above $12 and that, while the Company was not asking for a re-bid at this time, Party C should
only proceed with an acknowledgement of that understanding. After discussion, Party C agreed that it would continue in the
process with that understanding.

Later on June 16, 2017, a representative of Guggenheim contacted Monomoy, noting that in evaluating Monomoy’s mark-up of
the bid draft merger agreement, the Board had expressed concerns regarding the debt financing structure as well as the mark-up of
other terms reflected in the merger agreement. Guggenheim also reiterated that the offer price was disappointing to the Board
relative to the initial range and unlikely to be high enough to complete a transaction. Subsequently, Monomoy’s outside counsel,
Kirkland & Ellis (“K&E”), had a preliminary discussion regarding the merger agreement with Sidley, and delivered a revised draft
merger agreement on June 19.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

During the period from June 16 through June 23, 2017, Monomoy and Party C continued to conduct their confirmatory due
diligence, and Sidley engaged in discussions with K&E, counsel to Monomoy, and counsel to Party C, regarding the merger
agreement mark-ups and exchanged drafts of the merger agreement, the equity commitment letter, the limited guarantee, voting and
support agreement and other ancillary agreements. Guggenheim also held calls with Monomoy to discuss Monomoy’s proposed
financing arrangements.

On June 23, 2017, the Strategic Committee held a meeting, in which Mr. Repass, members of the senior management of the
Company and representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley participated. Guggenheim provided an update on the process and its
discussions with Monomoy and Party C, noting that both bidders were prepared to make their best and final bids. Guggenheim then
reviewed its preliminary valuation analysis of the Company, a transaction analysis for each bidder and a retail market update,
discussed the proposed debt and equity financing requirements of Monomoy and the “all-equity” bid by Party C, and recommended
distributing the bid instruction letter to each bidder to submit its best and final offer. A representative of Sidley then reviewed the
open items in the draft merger agreements and possible resolutions of those issues. Following the discussion, the committee
approved the Company to proceed with the proposed bidding process and instruct the two remaining bidders to submit their best
and final offers by June 27, 2017.

Later on June 23, 2017, Guggenheim sent the best and final bid instruction letters to Monomoy and Party C.

On the next day, June 24, 2017, the Board held a meeting, in which members of management of the Company and
representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley participated. Management provided an update on the Company’s operation and business.
A representative of Guggenheim reviewed its preliminary valuation analysis, the status of the process and next steps planned based
on the discussions at the Strategic Committee meeting on the previous date, noting that instruction letters had been distributed
requesting each bidder to submit its best and final bid by June 27, 2017. The Board discussed Guggenheim’s valuation analysis and
observed that the value likely to be reflected in the best and final bids would likely exceed the value expected to be achieved if the
Company were to remain an standalone public company. Following the discussion, the Board determined to convene their next
meeting on June 28 to review the final bids.

On June 25, 2017, Guggenheim informed Monomoy that given an “all-equity” bid submitted by a competing bidder that the
Board valued from a deal certainty perspective, Monomoy should seek to improve terms to increase deal certainty and to
distinguish itself on price.

On June 26 and 27, 2017, Guggenheim held calls with the financial advisor to Monomoy and with Party C, during which
Guggenheim responded to each party regarding the bidding status.

Late in the day on June 27, 2017, Party C submitted its final proposal to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of our
common stock for cash at a purchase price $12.03 per share, on an all-equity commitment basis. Party C also submitted its revised
draft of the merger agreement.

Also on June 27, 2017, Monomoy submitted its final proposal to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of our
common stock for cash at a purchase price $13.01 per share. Monomoy also submitted its revised draft of the merger agreement,
the equity commitment letter and the fully-executed debt commitment letters.

In the morning of June 28, 2017, Guggenheim discussed with Monomoy the Company’s final capitalization details that would
be included in the execution version of a merger agreement, which figures differed from the estimates provided earlier in the
process and upon which both Monomoy and Party C’s per share bid prices were based. After reviewing the Company’s updated
capitalization numbers and discussing with Guggenheim, Monomoy adjusted its final bid per share price to $12.97, which
represented a total equity value of $337.7 million, consistent with the total equity value implied in its proposal submitted on the
previous day.

Later in the morning on June 28, 2017, the Board met via telephone to discuss the final bids submitted by Monomoy and Party
C, in which members of senior management of the Company and representatives of Guggenheim and of Sidley participated. At that
meeting, a representative of Guggenheim reviewed and discussed the final bids from Monomoy and Party C, including the
adjustments associated with the Company’s

final capitalization figures. Following the discussion, the Board determined that the Monomoy offer was superior to the other
proposal, instructed management and its advisors to finalize the transaction with Monomoy and directed Guggenheim to notify
each bidder of the Board’s decision. The Board also instructed Guggenheim to further review and discuss with Monomoy the terms
of the debt and equity financings included in Monomoy’s bid, with an aim to improve the deal certainty.

Following such instructions, on June 28, 2017, Guggenheim notified Monomoy that the Board had instructed Guggenheim and
Sidley to finalize the transaction with Monomoy, subject to the continuing review of the debt and equity commitment letters
included in Monomoy’s final bid. During July 28 and 29, 2017, Guggenheim had a series of discussions with Monomoy to clarify
and negotiate the terms of the debt and equity financings and Sidley finalized the terms of the merger agreement and other ancillary
agreements and documents with K&E.

Also on June 28, 2017, Guggenheim notified Party C that its final bid was lower than the other bid and that the Company was
moving forward to execute a transaction with the other bidder. Party C requested additional information later in the day and was
informed by Guggenheim that its proposed price fell far short of the other bid. Late in the afternoon, Party C submitted a revised
offer to Guggenheim, increasing the purchase price per share from $12.03 in the offer submitted the day before to $12.50.

Shortly after receipt of Party C’s revised offer, Ms. Rambo, members of management and representatives of Guggenheim and
Sidley held a call, during which they reviewed and discussed Party C’s revised offer and how to determine whether Party C would
further increase its price. Given how late in the day this latest development was occurring, the participants believed that, based on
the Board’s discussion at its meeting earlier that day, the Board would likely still view Monomoy’s bid as being superior
notwithstanding the greater financing certainty associated with Party C’s bid. Ms. Rambo contacted Mr. Repass, who confirmed his
agreement with this assessment. Ms. Rambo then instructed Guggenheim to seek to determine whether Party C could further
increase its price, noting that, based on Party C’s current price, the Company would still proceed towards finalizing the transaction
with the other bidder. Ms. Rambo immediately contacted the other members of the Board, each of whom also confirmed his or her
agreement with this assessment.

Following the call, in the evening of June 28, 2017, a representative of Guggenheim contacted a representative of Party C to
inform Party C of the reaction to their revised bid. Party C stated that they could not increase their bid above $12.50.

On June 29, 2017, the Board held a meeting in which members of management and representatives of Guggenheim and Sidley
participated. At the meeting, a representative of Guggenheim updated the Board on the revised offer submitted by Party C. A
representative of Sidley then reviewed with the Board its fiduciary duties in the context of the proposed Merger and summarized
the material terms of the proposed form of the merger agreement. At the request of the Board, Guggenheim then reviewed and
discussed its financial analysis with respect to the Company and the final bids from Monomoy and Party C, as well as the terms of
the debt and equity financing involved in Monomoy’s bid and the negotiations over the past few days. Thereafter, at the request of
the Board, Guggenheim verbally rendered its opinion to the Board, which was subsequently confirmed in writing by delivery of
Guggenheim’s written opinion addressed to the Board dated June 29, 2017, as to, as of such date and based on and subject to the
matters considered, the procedures followed, the assumptions made and various limitations of and qualifications to the review
undertaken, the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of our common stock (excluding the Company or any of its
wholly owned subsidiaries or Parent or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries), of the merger consideration to be received by such
holders from Monomoy in the merger pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The Board then unanimously approved the
Merger Agreement with Monomoy, the voting and support agreements, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, and resolved to recommend to the Company stockholders that they adopt the Merger Agreement.

Shortly after the June 29 meeting, the Company and Monomoy executed the Merger Agreement and received the executed final
copies of the limited guarantee, the equity commitment letter, the debt commitment letters and the voting and support agreements.
The Company and Monomoy issued a joint press release announcing the execution of the Merger Agreement.

Recommendation of the Board and Reasons for the Merger

Recommendation of the Board

After careful consideration and consulting with the legal and financial advisors to the Board, the Board unanimously (i) adopted
and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, (iii) determined
that the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, are advisable and in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and (iv) recommended that the Company stockholders adopt the Merger
Agreement and directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the Company stockholders for adoption.

Accordingly, the Board unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption the Merger Agreement; (2) “FOR”
the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger; and (3) “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement.

Reasons for the Merger

In evaluating the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, the Board and the
Strategic Committee consulted with the Company’s senior management team and outside legal and financial advisors and, in
reaching its decision to recommend that the Company stockholders approve the Merger Agreement, the Board considered and
evaluated numerous factors, including the following material factors, each of which the Board believes supported their
determinations (which factors are not presented in order of relative importance):

Company’s Operating and Financial Condition; Prospects of the Company.  The Board considered that the Merger
Consideration of $12.97 per share to be received by our stockholders provides greater certainty of value (and less risk) to our
stockholders relative to the potential trading price of our common stock over a longer period after accounting for the long-term
risks to our business resulting from operational execution risk and evolving industry dynamics. The Board considered the
possibility of continuing to operate the Company as a standalone public company, including the related risks and uncertainties
and the prospects for the Company going forward as a standalone entity. In doing so, the Board considered the following:

• the current and historical financial condition, results of operations and business of the Company and the Company’s
historical performance relative to other companies in the sector, the Company’s stock price performance over an
extended period of time relative to the Merger Consideration, the risks associated with achieving and executing upon
the Company’s financial plan and the other risks disclosed under “Risk Factors” in the Company’s most recent annual
report on Form 10-K;

• overall sector conditions and changes in the nature of the retail business, including:

• increasing competition in the sector;

• challenges posed by the continuing shift of sales from brick-and-mortar stores to the internet, as well as overall
conditions in the financial services sector; and

• the general downward trend in the trading prices of retail companies with a significant brick-and-mortar presence.

• the current state of the economy and uncertainty surrounding projected macroeconomic and consumer sentiment
conditions both in the near term and the long term; and

• in light of the foregoing, the Company’s near-term and longer-term prospects as a standalone company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Merger Consideration.  The Board considered the fact that the Merger Consideration of $12.97 represents:

• a premium of approximately 34.4% to the closing price of our common stock of $9.65 on June 29, 2017, the date the
Board approved, and the last full trading day before entering into, the Merger Agreement; and

• Parent’s best and final offer and, as of the date of the Merger Agreement, the highest per share consideration that the
Board believed was reasonably obtainable.

Strategic Review and Broad and Competitive Process.  The Board believed that the value offered to our stockholders in the
Merger was more favorable to our stockholders than the potential value of remaining a standalone company and that the Merger
Consideration obtained was the highest that was reasonably attainable. As part of the Board’s and the Strategic Committee’s
exploration of strategic alternatives, the Company and, on behalf of the Board, its financial advisor had contact with a wide
variety of potential parties interested in an acquisition of the Company over the course of approximately six months, including
by approaching 79 parties, executing non-disclosure agreements with 22 of them, receiving initial indications of interest from
seven of them. The Board also considered the revised and final bids submitted by the two finalists, of which Parent’s bid was
the higher, at $12.97.

Increase in Proposed Price.  The Board and the Strategic Committee considered that the Merger Consideration of $12.97 per
share was significantly higher than the price per share of $10.25 in the initial indication of interest received by the Board from
Monomoy on May 26, 2016.

Cash Consideration; Certainty of Value.  The Board and the Strategic Committee considered the fact that the Merger
Consideration will be paid in cash, providing certainty, immediate value and liquidity to our stockholders, in comparison to the
risks and uncertainty that would be inherent in remaining a standalone company.

No Financing Condition; Reverse Termination Fee.  The Board and the Strategic Committee considered the fact that the Merger
is not subject to a financing condition, Parent has obtained committed debt financing for the transaction from reputable
financial institutions and Monomoy has committed the Equity Financing of up to $130 million. The Board and the Strategic
Committee also considered (i) the limited number and nature of the conditions to the Debt Financing and Equity Financing, (ii)
the obligation of Parent to use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Debt Financing, and (iii) the Company’s ability, under
circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, including all conditions to Parent’s and Sub’s obligations to consummate the
Merger having been satisfied, the Company confirming the satisfaction (or waiver) of all conditions to the Company’s
obligation to consummate the Merger and that it stands ready, willing and able to close and Parent’s Debt Financing having
been funded or being available to be funded, to seek specific performance of Parent’s obligation to cause, and pursuant to the
Equity Commitment Letter, under certain circumstances to seek specific performance to directly cause, Monomoy to fund the
Equity Financing as contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Equity Commitment Letter, as described in further detail
in the section captioned “The Merger Agreement —  Specific Performance.” The Board and the Strategic Committee also
considered the Company’s right that, in the event of a failure of the Merger to be consummated under specified circumstances,
including all conditions Parent’s and Sub’s obligations to consummate the Merger having been satisfied and the Company
confirming the satisfaction (or waiver) of all conditions to the Company’s obligation to consummate the Merger and that it
stands ready, willing and able to close, to require Parent to pay the Company the Reverse Termination Fee of $17 million, or
approximately 5% of the equity value of the Merger, as described in further detail in the section captioned “The Merger
Agreement — Reverse Termination Fee and Other Remedies.”

Financial Analysis of the Company’s Financial Advisor and Related Opinion.  The Board and the Strategic Committee
considered the financial analysis reviewed by Guggenheim with the Board, the oral opinion of Guggenheim rendered to the
Board on June 29, 2017, and Guggenheim’s written opinion addressed to the Board dated June 29, 2017, as to the fairness, as of
such date, from a financial point of view, to our stockholders (excluding the Company or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries
or Parent or

any of its wholly owned subsidiaries), of the Merger Consideration to be received by such holders in the Merger pursuant to the
Merger Agreement, which opinion was based on and subject to the matters considered, the procedures followed, the
assumptions made and various limitations and qualifications to the review undertaken as more fully described under the section
captioned “Opinion of Guggenheim Securities, LLC.”

Negotiations with Parent.  The Board and the Strategic Committee considered the benefits that we and our advisors were able to
obtain during our negotiations with Parent and that the Merger Agreement was the product of arm’s-length negotiations, and
contained terms and conditions that were, in the Board’s view, advisable and favorable to us and our stockholders.

Merger Agreement.  The Board and the Strategic Committee considered the provisions of the Merger Agreement, including:

• our ability under certain circumstances to entertain unsolicited proposals for an acquisition that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior proposal;

• the ability of the Board under certain circumstances to withdraw or modify its recommendation that our stockholders
adopt the Merger Agreement, including in connection with a Superior Proposal;

• our right to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances in order to accept a Superior Proposal and
enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, subject to paying the Company Termination
Fee;

• our and Parent’s respective termination rights;

• the representations and warranties of the Company, which the Board and the Strategic Committee considered reasonable
for a transaction of this nature, and which were in several cases qualified by “Company Material Adverse Effect” and
by disclosures made in our SEC filings, and in other cases by knowledge or materiality, or by reference to certain
limited time periods;

• the representations and warranties of Parent and Sub;

• the covenants and agreements of the parties; and

• the conditions to closing of the Merger.

Timing of Consummation.  The Board and the Strategic Committee considered the anticipated timing of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Appraisal Rights.  The Board and the Strategic Committee considered the availability of statutory appraisal rights to our
stockholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and otherwise comply with all required
procedures under the DGCL.

Stockholders’ Ability to Reject the Merger.  The Board and the Strategic Committee considered the fact that the Merger is
subject to the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of our common
stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon as of the close of business on the Record Date.

Voting Agreement.  The Board and the Strategic Committee considered the fact that the Voting Agreement with Randolph K.
Repass, his spouse and a number of the Repass family trusts terminates in the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated,
which would permit such stockholders to support a transaction involving a Superior Proposal.

The Board and the Strategic Committee also considered a variety of risks and uncertainties and other potentially negative
factors in its evaluation of the Merger and the Merger Agreement, including, but not limited to, the following:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Potential Payment of a Termination Fee.  The requirement, under certain circumstances, to pay the Company Termination Fee
of $11 million, though the Board believed that the amount of such fee was reasonable relative to similar transactions.

Delays in or Failure to Consummate Merger.  The Merger may be delayed or not be consummated, resulting in loss of value to
our stockholders and negative impact on our financial position, operations and prospects.

Lack of Ongoing Equity Participation for Our Stockholders.  Our stockholders will have no ongoing equity participation in the
Company or Parent following the Merger, and our stockholders will cease to participate in our future earnings or growth, if any,
and will not benefit from increases, if any, in the value of our common stock following the Merger.

Substantial Costs of Merger.  There have been and will continue to be significant costs involved in connection with negotiating
the Merger Agreement and consummating the Merger (certain of which we will be required to bear), including in connection
with the pursuit of regulatory approval and in connection with litigation that could arise in the future in connection with the
Merger. In addition, substantial management time and effort have been and will continue to be required to effectuate the
Merger, which could result in disruption of our day-to-day operations during the pendency of the Merger.

Disruption of Business and Other Relationships.  If the Merger is not consummated, the pendency of the Merger could
adversely affect our and our subsidiaries’ relationships with our and their respective customers, suppliers, associates and others
with whom we and they have business dealings.

Restrictions on Our Operations.  The terms of the Merger Agreement place restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to
consummation of the Merger, which may delay or prevent us from undertaking business opportunities that may arise prior to
consummation of the Merger.

Taxable Transaction for Stockholders.  The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the Merger
will be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes for many of our stockholders.

Interest of Our Directors and Executive Officers.  Our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are
different from, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders, including (i) the expectation that certain of our executive
officers may enter into agreements with Parent or Sub regarding employment with the Surviving Corporation, (ii) the cash-out
of the Options, all of which are vested, held by executive officers and directors and the accelerated vesting and cash-out of
RSUs held by non-employee directors, (iii) the assumption of the RSUs held by our executive officers by the Surviving
Corporation and the right to receive cash payment based on each holder’s continued employment with the Surviving
Corporation through the applicable vesting dates, (iv) the acceleration of RSUs and certain severance benefits to the executive
officers under the Top Hat Severance Plan if his or her employment is terminated without cause or if such executive officer
resigns for good reason, and (v) continued indemnification and insurance coverage for our directors and executive officers from
the Surviving Corporation and Parent under the terms of the Merger Agreement.

After taking into account all of the factors set forth above, as well as others, the Board concluded that the risks, uncertainties,
and potentially negative factors associated with the Merger were outweighed by the potential benefits of the Merger to the
Company and our stockholders. Accordingly, the Board determined that the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.

FACTORS CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD IN ITS CONSIDERATION OF THE MERGER, BUT IS MERELY A

Opinion of Guggenheim Securities, LLC

Overview

Pursuant to an engagement letter dated November 29, 2016, the Board retained Guggenheim to act as its financial advisor with
respect to the potential sale of the Company. In selecting Guggenheim as the Board’s financial advisor, the Board considered that,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

With respect to the information used in arriving at Guggenheim’s opinion:

• Guggenheim relied upon and assumed the accuracy, completeness and reasonableness of all industry, business, financial,
legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, actuarial and other information (including, without limitation, the Projections, other
estimates and other forward-looking information) furnished by or discussed with the Company or obtained from public
sources, data suppliers and other third parties.

• Guggenheim (i) did not assume any responsibility, obligation or liability for the accuracy, completeness, reasonableness,
achievability or independent verification of, and Guggenheim did not independently verify, any such information
(including, without limitation, the Projections, any other estimates and any other forward-looking information), (ii)
expressed no view, opinion, representation, guaranty or warranty (in each case, express or implied) regarding the
reasonableness or achievability of the Projections, any other estimates and any other forward-looking information or the
assumptions upon which they are based and (iii) relied upon the assurances of the Company’s senior management that they
are unaware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information (including, without limitation, the Projections,
any other estimates and any other forward-looking information) incomplete, inaccurate or misleading.

• Specifically, with respect to (i) the Projections, any other estimates and any other forward-looking information furnished by
or discussed with the Company, (a) Guggenheim was advised by the Company’s senior management and Guggenheim
assumed, that the Projections, other estimates and other forward-looking information utilized in its analyses had been
reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the Company’s senior
management as to the expected future performance of the Company and the corporate income tax rates applicable to the
Projections and (b) Guggenheim assumed that such Projections, other estimates and such other forward-looking information
were reviewed by the Board with the understanding that such information would be used and relied upon by Guggenheim in
connection with rendering its opinion and (ii) any projections, any other estimates and/or any other forward-looking
information obtained by Guggenheim from public sources, data suppliers and other third parties, Guggenheim assumed that
such information was reasonable and reliable.

• During the course of its engagement, the Board asked Guggenheim to solicit indications of interest from various potential
strategic and private equity acquirors regarding a potential transaction with the Company, and Guggenheim considered the
results of such solicitation process in rendering its opinion.

Guggenheim also noted certain other considerations with respect to its engagement and the rendering of its opinion:

• Guggenheim did not perform or obtain any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including any contingent,
derivative or off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or any other entity or the solvency or fair value of the
Company or any other entity, nor was Guggenheim furnished with any such appraisals.

• Guggenheim’s professionals are not legal, regulatory, tax, consulting, accounting, appraisal or actuarial experts and
Guggenheim’s opinion should not be construed as constituting advice with respect to such matters; accordingly,
Guggenheim relied on the assessments of the Company and its other advisors with respect to such matters. The Company’s
senior management advised Guggenheim that the Projections, all other estimates and all other forward-looking information
reflect the current U.S. federal corporate income tax regime pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; at
the direction of the Board and the Company’s senior management, Guggenheim did not consider or analyze the impacts of
any potential or proposed reform thereof in connection with its opinion and analyses. Guggenheim did not express any view
or render any opinion regarding the tax consequences of the Merger to the Company or its stockholders.

Summary of Financial Analyses

Overview of Financial Analyses

This “Summary of Financial Analyses” presents a summary of the principal financial analyses performed by Guggenheim and
presented to the Board in connection with Guggenheim’s rendering of its opinion. Such presentation to the Board was
supplemented by Guggenheim’s oral discussion, the nature and substance of which may not be fully described herein.

Some of the financial analyses summarized below include summary data and information presented in tabular format. In order
to understand fully such financial analyses, the summary data and tables must be read together with the full text of the summary.
Considering the summary data and tables alone could create a misleading or incomplete view of Guggenheim’s financial analyses.

The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and involves various judgments and determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant financial analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances involved. A
fairness opinion therefore is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description, and taking portions of the financial
analyses set forth below, without considering such analyses as a whole, would in Guggenheim’s view create an incomplete and
misleading picture of the processes underlying the financial analyses considered in rendering Guggenheim’s opinion.

In arriving at its opinion, Guggenheim:

• based its financial analyses on various assumptions, including assumptions concerning general business and economic
conditions, capital markets considerations and industry-specific and company-specific factors, all of which are beyond the
control of the Company, Monomoy and Guggenheim;

• did not form a view or opinion as to whether any individual analysis or factor, whether positive or negative, considered in
isolation, supported or failed to support its opinion;

• considered the results of all of its financial analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any one analysis or factor;
and

• ultimately arrived at its opinion based on the results of all of its financial analyses assessed as a whole and believed that the
totality of the factors considered and the various financial analyses performed by Guggenheim in connection with its
opinion operated collectively to support its determination as to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date

owned subsidiaries or Parent or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries) to the extent expressly specified in such opinion.

With respect to the financial analyses performed by Guggenheim in connection with rendering its opinion:

• Such financial analyses, particularly those based on estimates and projections, are not necessarily indicative of actual values
or actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than suggested by these analyses.

• None of the selected publicly traded companies used in the selected publicly traded companies analysis described below is
identical or directly comparable to the Company, and none of the selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions
used in the selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions analysis described below is identical or directly

because they represented or involved target companies which may be considered broadly similar, for purposes of
Guggenheim’s financial analyses, to the Company based on Guggenheim’s familiarity with the retail industry.

• Selected publicly traded companies analysis and selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions analysis are not
mathematical; rather, such analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning the differences in business,
financial, operating and capital markets-related characteristics and other factors regarding the selected publicly traded
companies and selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions to which the Company and the Merger were
compared.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In performing its selected precedent merger and acquisition transactions analysis:

• Guggenheim selected a reference range of transaction multiples for purposes of evaluating West Marine on a change-of-
control basis as follows: (i) transaction enterprise value/CY (EBITDA — CapEx) multiple range of 9.4x – 16.2x, which
resulted in a reference range of $11.18 to $16.49 per share for purposes of evaluating our common stock on a change-of-
control basis; (ii) transaction enterprise value/CY EBIT multiple range of 9.6x – 14.6x, which resulted in a reference range
of $9.72 to $12.81 per share for purposes of evaluating our common stock on a change-of-control basis; and (iii) transaction
CY cash-adjusted P/E multiple range of 15.9x – 23.9x, which resulted in a reference range of $9.70 to $12.68 per share for
purposes of evaluating our common stock on a change-of-control basis.

• Guggenheim noted that the Merger Consideration of $12.97 was above the foregoing change-of-control transaction
reference ranges based on transaction enterprise value/CY EBIT multiples and transaction CY cash-adjusted P/E multiples
and was in line with reference range based on transaction enterprise value/CY (EBITDA — CapEx) multiples.

Discounted Cash Flow Analyses.

Guggenheim performed illustrative stand-alone discounted cash flow analyses of the Company based on management’s
projected unlevered free cash flows for the Company (treating the impact of stock-based compensation as a cash expense) and an
estimate of its terminal/continuing value at the end of the projection horizon. In performing its illustrative discounted cash flow
analyses:

• Guggenheim based its discounted cash flow analyses on the Projections as provided by the Company’s senior management.

• Guggenheim estimated the Company’s weighted average cost of capital to be within a range of 11.25% – 14.25% based on,
among other factors, (i) Guggenheim’s then-current estimate of the prospective U.S. equity risk premium range of 5.5% –
 6.5%, (ii) a review of the Company’s historical five-year adjusted beta as reported by Bloomberg, its historical two-year
adjusted beta as reported by Bloomberg and its Barra predicted beta as well as similar beta information for the Company’s
selected peer group companies, resulting in an estimated levered beta range of 1.000 – 1.350, (iii) the prevailing
interpolated yield on the 20-year U.S. Treasury bond of 2.60% as of June 28, 2017 as a proxy for the risk-free rate of return,
(iv) a size/liquidity premium of 3.10% applicable to companies of a comparable size to the Company as reported by Duff
and Phelps 2017 Valuation Handbook, (v) the Company’s target capital structure on a prospective basis which was assumed
not to include any debt and (vi) Guggenheim’s investment banking and capital markets judgment and experience in valuing
companies similar to the Company.

• Guggenheim applied the mid-year convention when discounting future cash flows.

• In calculating the Company’s terminal/continuing value for purposes of its discounted cash flow analyses, Guggenheim
used an illustrative range of perpetuity growth rates of the Company’s terminal year normalized unlevered free cash flow of
(2.0%) – 0.0%.

• Guggenheim illustrative discounted cash flow analyses resulted in an overall reference range of implied values of $11.72 to
$14.88 per share of our common stock for purposes of evaluating our common stock on a stand-alone intrinsic-value basis.

• Guggenheim noted that the Merger Consideration of $12.97 per share of our common stock was in line with the
aforementioned reference range based on the illustrative discounted cash flow analyses.

Other Financial Reviews and Analyses for Informational Reference Purposes

In order to provide certain context for the financial analyses in connection with its opinion as described above, Guggenheim
undertook various additional financial reviews and analyses as summarized below for informational reference purposes. As a
general matter, Guggenheim did not consider such additional financial reviews and analyses to be determinative methodologies for
purposes of its opinion.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Discounted Cash Flow Sensitivity Analysis.

Guggenheim repeated the discounted cash flow analyses described above after sensitizing certain of the Company’s EBITDA
margins and the Company’s average comparable sales during the Projections period. These variables were selected, in consultation
with the Company’s management and the Board, because of the potential volatility in operating performance in the current retail
environment. The sensitized discounted cash flow analyses applied the same WACC and perpetuity growth rates as the illustrative
discounted cash flow analyses described above. Guggenheim illustrative discounted cash flow sensitivity analyses resulted in an
overall reference range of implied values of $7.65 to $14.88 per share of our common stock.

The results of the illustrative discounted cash flow sensitivity analysis based on variations in the Company’s EBITDA margin
and average comparable sales are summarized in the tables below:

aforementioned reference range based on the illustrative discounted cash flow sensitivity analyses presented above.

Leveraged Buyout Analysis.

Guggenheim performed an illustrative analysis of the implied price per share of our common stock that could theoretically be
paid by a financial sponsor, assuming a June 30, 2017 starting balance sheet and that such sponsor required a 4.5-year internal rate
of return ranging from 20% – 25%. Guggenheim performed the illustrative leveraged buyout analysis assuming (i) the transaction
was completed with $124 million of total debt (implying initial leverage ratios of approximately 3.1x EBITDA and 4.1x
EBITDAR, which levels were consistent with the size of the equity guarantee provided by Monomoy (ii) the Company achieved
the management projections during the 4.5-year projection period and (iii) the financial sponsor exited its investment at the end of
the 4.5-year projection period for an enterprise value/EBITDA multiple ranging from 3.5x – 5.5x.

• Based on these assumptions, the leveraged buyout analysis implied a reference range of values of $11.69 to $14.50 per
share of our common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Wall Street Equity Research Analyst Stock Price Targets.

Guggenheim reviewed selected Wall Street equity research analyst stock price targets for the Company as published prior to
June 28, 2017:

• Guggenheim noted that such Wall Street equity research analyst stock price targets for shares of our common stock ranged
from $11.00 to $12.00 per share. For comparison purposes, Guggenheim noted that the Merger Consideration of $12.97 per
share was above the foregoing equity research price target range for the Company.

• Guggenheim noted that the public market trading price targets published by Wall Street equity research analysts do not
necessarily reflect current market trading prices for shares of our common stock, and such estimates are subject to various
uncertainties, including the Company’s future financial performance and future capital markets conditions.

Other Considerations

Except as described in the summary above, the Company did not provide specific instructions to, or place any limitations on,
Guggenheim with respect to the procedures to be followed or factors to be considered in performing its financial analyses or
providing its opinion. The type and amount of consideration payable in the Merger were determined through negotiations between
the Company and Monomoy and were approved by the Board. The decision to enter into the Merger Agreement was solely that of
the Board. Guggenheim’s opinion was just one of the many factors taken into consideration by the Board. Consequently,
Guggenheim’s financial analyses should not be viewed as determinative of the decision of the Board with respect to the fairness,
from a financial point of view, of the Merger Consideration to holders of shares of our common stock (excluding the Company or
any of its wholly owned subsidiaries or Parent or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries).

Pursuant to the terms of Guggenheim’s engagement letter, the Company has agreed to pay Guggenheim a cash transaction fee
(based on a percentage of the aggregate consideration involved in the Merger) contingent upon consummation of the Merger, which
cash transaction fee is estimated to be approximately $5.9 million. In connection with Guggenheim engagement, a cash milestone
fee of $1.0 million became payable upon delivery of Guggenheim’s opinion, which will be credited against the foregoing cash
transaction fee. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse Guggenheim for certain expenses and to indemnify Guggenheim
against certain liabilities arising out of its engagement.

As previously disclosed to the Board, aside from Guggenheim’s current engagement by the Company, Guggenheim has not
been previously engaged during the past two years by the Company, nor has Guggenheim been previously engaged during the past
two years by Monomoy, to provide financial advisory or investment banking services for which Guggenheim received fees.
Guggenheim may seek to provide the Company, Monomoy, and their respective affiliates with certain financial advisory and
investment banking services unrelated to the Merger in the future, for which services Guggenheim would expect to receive
compensation.

Guggenheim and its affiliates and related entities engage in a wide range of financial services activities for its and their own
accounts and the accounts of Guggenheim and its customers, including: asset, investment and wealth management; insurance
services; investment banking, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and restructuring; merchant banking; fixed income and
equity sales, trading and research; and derivatives, foreign exchange and futures. In the ordinary course of these activities,
Guggenheim or its affiliates and related entities may (i) provide such financial services to the Company, Monomoy, other
participants in the Merger or their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, investment funds and portfolio companies, for which services
Guggenheim or its affiliates and related entities has received, and may receive, compensation and (ii) directly or indirectly, hold
long or short positions, trade and otherwise conduct such activities in or with respect to certain bank debt, debt or equity securities
and derivative products of or relating to the Company, Monomoy, other participants in the Merger or their respective affiliates,
subsidiaries, investment funds and portfolio companies. Furthermore, Guggenheim or its affiliates and related entities and
Guggenheim’s or its affiliates’

TABLE OF CONTENTS

respective directors, officers, employees, consultants and agents may have investments in the Company, Monomoy, other
participants in the Merger or their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, investment funds and portfolio companies.

Consistent with applicable legal and regulatory guidelines, Guggenheim has adopted certain policies and procedures to
establish and maintain the independence of its research departments and personnel. As a result, Guggenheim’s research analysts
may hold views, make statements or investment recommendations and publish research reports with respect to the Company,
Monomoy, other participants in the Merger or their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, investment funds and portfolio companies and
the Merger that differ from the views of Guggenheim’s investment banking personnel.

Forward-Looking Financial Information

Given the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates inherent in preparing financial projections, the
Company does not as a matter of general practice publicly disclose detailed projections as to its anticipated financial position or
results of operations, other than providing, from time to time, estimated ranges for the then-current fiscal year of certain expected
financial results in its regular earnings press releases and other investor materials.

In connection with the Company’s evaluation of a possible transaction and other strategic alternatives, the Company’s
management prepared certain forward-looking financial information with respect to fiscal years 2017 through 2021 (the “financial
projections”), which is summarized below, and provided such information to the Board, the Strategic Committee and Guggenheim.
The financial projections were made available in the virtual data room to Monomoy and other potential buyers in connection with
their due diligence investigation and evaluation of a possible transaction.

The financial projections were prepared assuming the Company’s continued operation on a standalone basis without any sale of
or partnership with respect to the financial services business.

None of the financial projections were intended for public disclosure. A summary of the financial projections is included in this
proxy statement only because the financial projections or certain portions thereof were made available to the Board, the Strategic
Committee, Guggenheim, Monomoy and other potential buyers, as applicable. The inclusion of the financial projections in this
proxy statement does not constitute an admission or representation by the Company that the financial projections or the information
contained therein is material.

The financial projections are unaudited and were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or compliance with the
guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective
financial information or generally accepted accounting principles as applied in the U.S. (“GAAP”) or the published guidelines of
the SEC regarding projections and the use of non-GAAP financial measures. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has neither audited,
reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied any procedures with respect to the financial projections and, accordingly,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance, or take any responsibility, with respect
thereto.

In the view of the Company’s management, the financial projections were prepared on a reasonable basis reflecting
management’s best available estimates and judgments regarding the Company’s future financial performance at the time of their
preparation. The financial projections are not facts and should not be relied upon as necessarily predictive of actual future results.
You are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon the financial projections. Some or all of the assumptions that have been made in
connection with the preparation of the financial projections may have changed since the date the financial projections were
prepared. None of the Company, Monomoy or any of their respective affiliates, advisors or other representatives assumes any
responsibility for the validity, reasonableness, accuracy or completeness of the financial projections or the ultimate performance of
the Company relative to the financial projections. Except as required by applicable law, neither the Company nor any of its
affiliates intends to, and each of them disclaims any obligation to, update, correct or otherwise revise the financial projections if
any or all of them have changed or change or otherwise have become, are or become inaccurate (even in the short term). These
considerations should be taken into account if evaluating the financial projections, which were prepared as of an earlier date.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The financial projections do not necessarily reflect changes in general business or economic conditions since the time they were
prepared, changes in the Company’s businesses or their prospects or any other transactions or events that have occurred or that may
occur and that were not anticipated at the time the financial projections were prepared, and the financial projections are not
necessarily indicative of current values or necessarily predictive of future performance, which may be significantly more favorable
or less favorable than as set forth therein and should not be regarded as a representation that the financial forecasts, projected
results or other estimates and assumptions therein will be achieved.

Because the financial projections reflect subjective judgment in many respects, they are susceptible to multiple interpretations
and frequent revisions based on actual experience and business developments. The financial projections also cover multiple fiscal
years, and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding fiscal year. The financial projections
constitute forward-looking information and are subject to a wide variety of significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the
actual results to differ materially from the projected results, including, without limitation, the factors described in the section
entitled “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the
SEC on February 28, 2017, and in the Company’s other public filings with the SEC. For additional information on factors that may
cause the Company’s future financial results to materially vary from the projected results summarized below, see the section
captioned “Forward-Looking Statements” on page 20. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized
below will be realized or that actual results will not differ materially from the projected results summarized below, and the financial
projections cannot be considered a guarantee of future operating results and should not be relied upon as such. No representation is
made by the Company or any of its affiliates, advisors or other representatives or any other person to any Company stockholder or
any other person regarding the actual performance of the Company compared to the results included in the financial projections or
otherwise.

The financial projections should be evaluated, if at all, in conjunction with the historical financial statements and other
information regarding the Company contained in the Company’s public filings with the SEC. For a more detailed description of the
information available, see the section captioned “Where You Can Find More Information” on page 106. The financial projections
do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared, including the effect of the Merger
and related matters. Further, the financial projections do not take into account the effect of any failure of the Merger to be
consummated and should not be viewed in any manner in that context.

The financial projections reflect various estimates, assumptions and methodologies of the Company, all of which are difficult to
predict and many of which are beyond the Company’s control, including, among other things, assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business, economic, regulatory, litigation, market and financial conditions and matters specific to the
Company’s businesses. Such assumptions include, but are not limited to, the following:

• the Company’s continued operation on a standalone basis;

• a modest increase in average comparable store sales at each store level for waterlife stores and waterlife-select stores, and a
slight decrease in average comparable store sales at each store level for traditional stores, during the five-year period;

• expansion into greenfield locations with new generic waterlife and waterlife-select stores;

• market consolidation, converting traditional stores into new waterlife stores;

• revitalization of waterlife and waterlife-select stores;

• no material increase in selling space;

• a steady increase in online traffic annually due to initiatives, including content development;

• modest improvement in conversion rates;

• moderate growth of professional sales within stores and declining hub revenue (i.e., fulfilling orders for professional
customers with van delivery in certain markets) through fiscal year 2019 before stabilizing;

• evolution of product mix to reflect growth and improved profitability offset by mix shift to lower margin channels;

• growth of private label to be a driver of improved margin;

• improved online profitability due to decreased discounting and increased efficiencies;

• distribution center expenses projected to be slightly downwards despite annual growth in retail direct-to-customer revenue;

• retail capital expenditure reflects continued retail transformation described above;

• capital expenditure for information technology and eCommerce improvements; and

• average tax rate consistent with the Company’s current average tax rate.

In addition, certain of the financial projections are non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, net revenue, net income
and unlevered cash flow. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolated form or as a substitute for financial
information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as used by the Company may not be
comparable to similarly titled financial measures used by other companies.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Financing

General.  Parent estimates that the total amount of funds required to consummate the merger and related transactions and pay
related fees and expenses will be approximately $354 million. Parent expects this amount to be funded through a combination of
the following:

• debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of $250 million, consisting of (i) a $225 million senior secured first-lien
credit facility of which $200 million is an asset-based revolving line of credit and $25 million is a first-in last-out asset-
based term loan, and (ii) a $25 million second lien asset-based term loan ((i) and (ii) together, the “Debt Financing”); and

• cash equity investments by Monomoy in an aggregate amount of up to $130 million.

Equity Financing.  On June 29, 2017, Monomoy entered into an equity commitment letter (the “Equity Commitment Letter”)
with Parent pursuant to which Monomoy committed to contribute (or cause to be contributed) to Parent up to $130 million in cash
in the aggregate (the “Equity Financing”). The Equity Commitment of Monomoy is subject to the following conditions:

• the conditions to closing in the Merger Agreement have been satisfied or waived; and

• the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded if and when the Equity Commitment is funded.

The obligation of Monomoy to fund the Equity Commitment will automatically and immediately terminate upon the earliest to
occur of: (i) the consummation of the Merger; (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement; or (iii) if neither of the foregoing have
occurred, 60 days after the Outside Date, unless the Company has made a claim to enforce the commitment of Monomoy in which
case the Equity Commitment continues until the claim is resolved or the parties otherwise agree.

The Company is an express third-party beneficiary of the Equity Commitment Letter and has the right to seek specific
performance of the obligations of Monomoy under the Equity Commitment Letter under certain circumstances.

Debt Financing.  In connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, (i) Bank of America, N.A. (“BAML”) provided
commitments to Parent under a commitment letter dated June 27, 2017 (the “BAML Debt Commitment Letter”), which provides
for a commitment to fund up to the $225 million senior-secured portion of the Debt Financing (the “BAML Debt Commitment”)
subject to terms and express conditions, and (ii) Pathlight Capital LLC (“Pathlight”) provided its commitment to Parent under a
commitment letter dated June 27, 2017 (the “Pathlight Debt Commitment Letter”), which provides for a commitment to fund the
$25 million second-lien term loan of the Debt Financing in the form subject to terms and express conditions. Under the BAML
Debt Commitment Letter and the Pathlight Debt Commitment Letter, BAML and Pathlight have committed to provide an aggregate
principal amount of $250 million in asset-based debt financing, consisting of a $200 million senior secured first lien revolving line
of credit, a $25 million senior secured first-in last-out term loan facility and a $25 million second lien term loan facility. Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (“MLPF&S”) will act as lead arranger to form a syndicate of financial institutions and
institutional investors (with BAML, the “Lenders”) to fund the BAML Debt Commitment, however, the formation of such a
syndicate is not a condition to the BAML Debt Commitment.

The obligations of the Lenders to provide the debt financing under the BAML Debt Commitment Letter and of Pathlight to
provide the debt financing under the Pathlight Debt Commitment Letter are subject to customary conditions, including, without
limitation, the following (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications as set forth in the BAML Debt Commitment Letter and
the Pathlight Debt Commitment Letter):

• the substantially simultaneous closing of the Merger in accordance in all material respects with the Merger Agreement;

• the substantially simultaneous funding of the equity financing;

• the repayment and termination of the Company’s existing senior secured credit facility;

with respect to the Debt Financing; and

Pathlight Debt Commitment Letter expire upon the earliest of (i) the Outside Date, (ii) the consummation of the Merger without the
use of the Debt Financing, and (iii) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement.

Limited Guarantees

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, an affiliated fund of Monomoy has executed and delivered a limited
guarantee in favor of the Company (the “Limited Guarantee”), pursuant to which such fund has agreed, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Limited Guarantee, to guarantee the payment of Parent’s obligations to pay the Reverse Termination Fee (as
described in more detail under “The Merger Agreement — Reverse Termination Fee and Other Remedies”), and certain
reimbursement and indemnification obligations, which are referred to as the “Guaranteed Obligations.”

The Limited Guarantee will terminate upon the earliest to occur of:

• the closing of the Merger;

• the payment, performance and/or satisfaction in full of the Guaranteed Obligations; and

• the valid termination of the Merger Agreement other than in a circumstance in which the Company is entitled to payment of
the Guaranteed Obligations, or the 30th day following any other purported termination of the Merger Agreement unless the
Company shall have commenced a suit, action or other proceeding alleging that any Guaranteed Obligations are due and
owing to the Company.

In the event that the Company, any shareholder or affiliate expressly asserts in any litigation or other legal proceeding relating
to a Limited Guarantee that certain provisions of the Limited Guarantee are illegal, invalid or unenforceable or that an affiliated
fund of Monomoy is liable in excess of the cap or other specified permitted claims, then (i) the obligations of such fund under such
Limited Guarantee will terminate, (ii) if such fund has previously made any payments under its Limited Guarantee, it will be
entitled to recover such payments from the Company and (iii) such fund will not have any liability to the Company with respect to
such Limited Guarantee.

Interests of the Company’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger

When considering the recommendation of the Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, you
should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to,
the interests of stockholders generally, as more fully described below. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii)
approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii) recommending that the Merger Agreement adopted by stockholders, the
Board and the Strategic Committee were aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among
other matters.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers

All rights to indemnification by the Company or any of its subsidiaries in favor of present and former directors and officers of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the “indemnified parties”) set forth in the organizational documents of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries as in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement will survive the Merger and will be observed by Parent and
the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. The Merger Agreement also
provides that the indemnification rights set forth in the indemnification agreements, the form of which was filed as an exhibit to the
Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, between the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and any of the directors, officers or employees thereof will be assumed by the Surviving Corporation and will continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

If the Company fails to do so prior to the Effective Time, Parent is obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain and
fully pay the premium for an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for a period of six years from the
Effective Time. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such a “tail” insurance policy as of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation must, and Parent must cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect
for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such
six-year period thereunder are being adjudicated) such insurance in place as of the date of the Merger Agreement with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the
date of the Merger Agreement. Alternatively, the Surviving Corporation is obligated to, and Parent must cause the Surviving
Corporation to, purchase comparable directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for such six-year period (and for so long thereafter
as any claims brought before the end of such six-year period thereunder are being adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of the Merger
Agreement.

For more information, see the section captioned “The Merger Agreement — Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and
Insurance.”

Treatment of Equity-Based Awards

Options

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Option granted under the Company Equity Incentive Plan that is then
outstanding, all of which are fully vested, will be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Option
will be entitled to receive payment of an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of our common stock
subject to such Option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share
subject to such cancelled Option, without interest; provided, however, that (i) any such Option with respect to which the exercise
price per share subject thereto is greater than the Merger Consideration will be cancelled in exchange for no consideration and (ii)
such option payments may be reduced by the amount of any required tax withholdings as contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Employee RSUs

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each RSU granted under the Company Equity Incentive Plan that is then outstanding
(other than those RSUs held by a non-employee director of the Company) will be assumed by the Surviving Corporation and will
be converted into a Cash Replacement Company RSU. Such Cash Replacement Company RSUs will, subject to the holder’s
continued employment with the Surviving Corporation through the applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same time
as the RSUs for such Cash Replacement Company RSUs were exchanged would have vested pursuant to their terms. All Cash
Replacement Company RSUs will have the same terms and conditions as applied to the RSUs for which they were exchanged,
except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or for administrative or
ministerial changes that are not materially detrimental to the holders and that are necessary for the administration of the Cash
Replacement Company RSUs. With respect to PSUs, the number of PSUs assumed by the Surviving Corporation and converted
into Cash Replacement Company RSUs will be determined (A) for PSUs with a performance period that by its terms has ended
prior

to the Effective Time, based on actual performance through the end of such performance period, and (B) for PSUs with a
performance period that by its terms has not ended prior to the Effective Time, assuming performance at 100% of target levels.

Non-Employee Director RSUs

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of unvested RSUs granted under the Company Equity Incentive Plan, that
is then outstanding and is held by a non-employee director of the Company will be fully vested and cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each holder of any such cancelled RSUs will be entitled to receive payment of an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of our common stock subject to such RSUs, without
interest; provided, however, that any such RSU payments may be reduced by the amount of any required tax withholdings as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Summary Table

The following table sets forth the number of shares of our common stock underlying Options and RSUs currently held by each
of the Company’s executive officers and non-employee directors, and also the cash payments that each Company executive officer
is expected to receive with respect to his vested outstanding Options (and, in the case of RSUs granted to Company executive
officers, the equity acceleration value of such unvested outstanding awards upon a qualified termination in connection with a
change in control) and that each Company non-employee director is expected to receive with respect to his or her vested Options
and unvested outstanding RSUs. The amounts in the table are based on the equity awards held by our executive officers and
directors as of August 4, 2017, the latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of this proxy statement, and
the Merger Consideration of $12.97 per share. These numbers do not forecast any grants, additional issuances, dividends, additional
deferrals or forfeitures of equity-based awards following the date of this proxy statement. Depending on when the closing date of
the Merger occurs, certain equity-based awards shown in the table may vest in accordance with their terms.

Matthew L. Hyde: 5,127; Jeffrey L. Lasher: 2,496; Barry Kelley: 1,944; and Paul Rutenis: 2,496. With respect to PSU awards
granted in 2017, this amount reflects the number of PSUs that would be awarded based on target performance as the

Treatment of Purchase Rights under the SPP

The Company’s Amended and Restated Associates Stock Buying Plan (the “SPP”) will be terminated prior to the Effective
Time and the Company will take all action necessary to: (i) cause any outstanding offering period under the SPP to be terminated
prior to the Effective Time; (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period; (iii)
provide that all outstanding options granted under the SPP (the “SPP Options”) will be canceled as of the closing date of the
Merger, provided that each holder of an SPP Option may exercise each outstanding purchase right under the SPP prior to the
Effective Time; (iv) provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence under the SPP after the date of the
Merger Agreement; and (v) ensure that no individual may make a new election to purchase shares in any current offering period or
increase his or her election to purchase shares in any current offering period. On such new exercise date, the Company shall apply
the funds credited as of such date under the SPP within each participant’s payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole
shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the SPP.

Payments Upon Termination Following Change-in-Control

All Executive Officers

We are parties to employment offer letters with each of our executive officers. These offer letters generally provide that each
executive officer is entitled to receive severance in accordance with the Company’s Amended and Restated Executive Officer
Severance Plan (the “Top Hat Severance Plan”) in the event their employment is terminated without “Cause” or they resign for
“Good Reason” in various scenarios, including in connection with a change in control, which will occur upon the consummation of
the Merger. Each executive officer has also executed a separate election letter to only receive severance benefits in accordance with
the Top Hat Severance Plan.

Pursuant to the Top Hat Severance Plan, if an executive officer’s employment is terminated without Cause or if such executive
officer resigns for Good Reason within 24 months following a change in control, which will occur upon the consummation of the
Merger, and provided such executive officer signs and does not revoke a release of all claims within 90 days following the date of
the executive officer’s termination of employment, then the executive officer will be entitled to receive accelerated vesting of all of
his or her unvested RSUs. In addition, such executive officer will be entitled to receive severance benefits equal to (i) the sum of
the executive officers’ annual base salary, plus the full amount of his or her annual target bonuses (provided, however, that with
respect to executive officers with the title of: (a) “Chief Executive Officer,” such sum will be multiplied by one and one-half times,
(b) “Executive Vice President” or “Senior Vice President,” such sum will be multiplied by one time, and (c) “Vice President,” or
any other title, such sum will be multiplied by one-half times), (ii) the prorated amount of his or her target bonus for the year in
which the termination occurred, (iii) Company-provided health continuation coverage following termination of employment for 18
months for executive officers with the title of “Chief Executive Officer” and “Executive Vice President” and 12 months for
executive officers with any other title, and (iv) outplacement services for a period of one year following termination of employment
in an amount not to exceed $20,000. The cash portion of these payments will be paid in a lump sum following the date on which
the required release becomes effective. In the event any payments or benefits payable pursuant to the Top Hat Severance Plan cause
the applicable executive officer to be subject to any golden parachute excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Internal
Revenue Code, payments made to such executive officer pursuant to the Top Hat Severance Plan will be reduced to an amount
equal to the greatest dollar amount that would not subject the named executive officer to the imposition of the excise tax, unless the
executive officer would be better off (on an after-tax basis) receiving all payments and paying all excise and income taxes.

The Merger will constitute a “change in control” for purposes of these agreements. “Cause” and “Good Reason” are defined as
follows in the Top Hat Severance Plan:

• “Cause” is defined as one or more of the following events: if the executive officer (i) has breached any material obligation
to the Company or its affiliates that is or could reasonably be expected to result in material harm to the Company; (ii) has
violated any significant Company policy; (iii) has violated any of the Company’s operating and/or financial/accounting
procedures which results in a material loss to the Company; (iv) has been arrested for, convicted of, or has pled guilty or
nolo

contendere to, any felony, or to any misdemeanor involving moral turpitude (including forgery, fraud, theft or
embezzlement); (v) has been arrested for, convicted of, or has pled guilty or nolo contendere to, any offense involving
fraud, dishonesty, breach of trust or money laundering; (vi) has engaged in dishonesty, embezzlement, misappropriation or
fraud in connection with the business of the Company, or has stolen property or opportunities of the Company, or has
assaulted or battered an associate or director of the Company; (vii) has failed substantially to perform his or her assigned
duties with the Company (other than a failure resulting from the executive officer’s incapacity due to physical or mental
illness or from the assignment to the executive officers that would constitute “Good Reason”); or (viii) has engaged in
willful malfeasance, illegal conduct, gross negligence or misconduct demonstrably injurious to the Company; provided,
however, that it shall only be deemed cause pursuant to clauses (i), (ii), (vii) and (viii) if the named executive officer is
given written notice describing the basis of cause and, if the event is reasonably susceptible of cure, the named executive
officer fails to cure within ten (10) days.

• “Good Reason” is defined as one or more of the following conditions that occur without the executive officer’s written
consent; (i) a material and adverse change in the executive officer’s title, position or responsibilities (excluding reporting
responsibilities) from his or title, position or responsibilities in effect immediately prior thereto (it being understood that a
change in title, position or responsibilities that results from the Company no longer having publicly-traded securities will
not be deemed to be material in and of itself); (ii) a reduction in the executive officer’s base salary by more than ten percent,
other than in connection with a reduction of ten percent or more applicable to all or substantially all of the Company’s
senior management; (iii) a relocation of the Company’s principal offices to which the executive officer reports to a location
more than 50 miles from its current location, excluding any executive officer who was not previously assigned to a
principal location or any required travel on the Company’s business, (iv) the Company requests that the executive officer
engage or participate in any unlawful act, or (v) the failure of any successor to the Company to assume the Top Hat
Severance Plan; provided, however, that it shall only be deemed good reason pursuant to the foregoing definition if (x) the
Company is given written notice from the named executive officer within 60 days following the first occurrence of a
condition that the executive officer considers to constitute good reason, (y) the Company is given 30 days to investigate the
allegations made by the executive officer and fails to remedy such condition within 30 days following such investigation,
and (z) the executive officer resigns from employment within 30 days following the end of the period within which the
Company was entitled to remedy the condition constituting good reason but failed to do so.

New Management Arrangements

As of the date of this proxy statement, none of the Company, Parent or Sub has entered into any employment agreements with
the Company’s named executive officers solely in connection with the Merger. No material terms have been discussed to date, but
going forward certain of the Company’s executive officers may have discussions, or may enter into agreements with, Parent or Sub
or their respective affiliates regarding employment with, or the right to purchase or participate in the equity of, the Surviving
Corporation or one or more of its affiliates.

Golden Parachute Compensation

In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or otherwise
relates to the Merger that may be paid or become payable to the Company’s named executive officers. Please see the previous
portions of this section for further information regarding this compensation.

The amounts indicated in the table below are estimates of the amounts that would be payable assuming, solely for purposes of
this table, that the Merger is consummated on August 4, 2017, and that the employment of each of the named executive officers
was subject to an involuntary termination on the date described in the footnotes below, as applicable. Our executive officers will
not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation, tax reimbursement or other benefits in connection with the Merger. For
purposes of calculating such amounts, we have assumed that no named executive officer will receive a reduction in benefits as a

In addition to the assumptions regarding the consummation date of the Merger and the termination of employment, these
estimates are based on certain other assumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the table below. Accordingly, the

entitled under the Top Hat Severance Plan, as described in the section captioned “The Merger — Interests of the Company’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Payments upon Termination following Change-in-Control” above. For each
named executive officer, the amount in this column assumes that such named executive officer experiences a qualifying
termination upon the consummation of the Merger or within 24 months thereafter.

The amount represents the amounts described above and assumes a prorated performance bonus is payable as of August 4,
2017, the assumed Effective Time. The amounts shown in this column are based on the compensation and benefit levels in
effect on August 4, 2017, the latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of this proxy statement;
therefore, if compensation and benefit levels are changed after such date, actual payments to an executive officer may be
different than those provided for above. Set forth below are the values of the cash severance components described above:

officer in exchange for the cancellation of all outstanding Options, which will occur upon consummation of the Merger, and (ii)
the “double-trigger” acceleration value of the unvested RSUs held by each of the named executive officers that would be
accelerated assuming a qualifying termination upon the consummation of the Merger or within 24 months thereafter. This
amount includes the value of accrued dividends in the amount of $0.05 per share as of August 4, 2017 that will be payable when
the RSUs (and PSUs) are settled. The amounts shown are based on the number of Options, RSUs and PSUs held by each named
executive officer as of August 4, 2017, the latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of this proxy
statement. The amounts shown do not attempt to forecast any grants, additional issuances, dividends, additional deferrals or
forfeitures of RSUs and/or PSUs following the date of this proxy statement. Depending on when the closing of the Merger
occurs, certain RSUs and PSUs will vest in accordance with their terms. No interest will accrue or otherwise be payable with
respect to any accrued dividends. The value of the RSUs that would be accelerated assuming a qualifying termination upon the
change in control are the “double-trigger” vesting acceleration benefits to which each named executive officer is entitled under
the Top Hat Severance Plan, as described in the section captioned “The Merger — Interests of the Company’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger — Payments upon Termination following Change-in-Control” above.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

The closing of the Merger will take place (i) on the date that is two business day following the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) of all of the conditions to the closing of the Merger (as described in the section of this proxy
captioned “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Merger”), other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the closing or (ii) at another date agreed to in writing
by the parties. The Effective Time will occur upon the filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or at such other time as is agreed upon in writing by Parent and the Company and specified in the certificate of merger in
accordance with the DGCL.

Appraisal Rights

If the Merger is consummated, stockholders who have complied exactly with the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the
DGCL, including stockholders who: (i) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) continuously hold their shares of our common stock through the Effective
Time; and (iii) properly demand appraisal of their shares of our common stock in compliance with the requirements of Section 262
are entitled to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the Merger under Section 262.

The following discussion is not a complete statement of the law pertaining to appraisal rights under Section 262 and is qualified
in its entirety by the full text of Section 262, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex C and incorporated herein by
reference. The following summary does not constitute any

TABLE OF CONTENTS

legal or other advice and does not constitute a recommendation that stockholders exercise their appraisal rights under Section 262.
Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in such
holder’s name. A person having a beneficial interest in shares of our common stock held of record in the name of another person,
such as a bank, broker or other nominee, must act promptly to cause the record holder to follow the steps summarized below
properly and in a timely manner to perfect appraisal rights. If you hold your shares of our common stock through a bank, broker or
other nominee and you wish to exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your bank, broker or the other nominee.

Under Section 262, holders of shares of our common stock who: (i) do not vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) continuously hold their shares of our
common stock through the Effective Time; and (iii) otherwise follow exactly the procedures set forth in Section 262, will be
entitled to have their shares appraised by the Court of Chancery and to receive payment in cash of the “fair value” of the shares of
our common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger, together with
interest to be paid on the amount determined to be fair value, if any, as determined by the Court of Chancery. Unless the Court of
Chancery, in its discretion, determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest on an appraisal award will accrue and compound
quarterly from the Effective Time through the date the judgment is paid at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including
any surcharge) as established from time to time during such period.

Under Section 262, where a merger agreement is to be submitted for adoption at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not
less than 20 days prior to the meeting, must notify each of its stockholders entitled to exercise appraisal rights that appraisal rights
are available and include in the notice a copy of Section 262. This proxy statement constitutes the Company’s notice to
stockholders that appraisal rights are available in connection with the Merger, and the full text of Section 262 is attached to this
proxy statement as Annex C. In connection with the Merger, any holder of shares of our common stock who wishes to exercise
appraisal rights or who wishes to preserve such holder’s right to do so should review Annex C carefully.

Failure to comply exactly with the requirements of Section 262 in a timely and proper manner will result in the loss of
appraisal rights under the DGCL.

A stockholder who loses his, her or its appraisal rights will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration described in the
Merger Agreement. Moreover, because of the complexity of the procedures for exercising the right to seek appraisal of shares of
our common stock, the Company believes that if a stockholder considers exercising such rights, such stockholder should seek the
advice of legal counsel.

Stockholders wishing to exercise the right to seek an appraisal of their shares of our common stock must, among other
requirements, do ALL of the following:

• the stockholder must not vote in favor of the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated thereby;

• the stockholder must deliver to the Company a written demand for appraisal that complies with Section 262 before the vote
on the Merger Agreement at the Special Meeting; and

• the stockholder must continuously hold the shares of our common stock through the Effective Time.

The stockholder or the Surviving Corporation must also file a petition in the Court of Chancery requesting a determination of
the fair value of the shares of our common stock within 120 days after the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation is under no
obligation to file any petition and has no intention of doing so.

Because a proxy that does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the Merger Agreement, a
stockholder who votes by proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must vote against the adoption of the Merger
Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, abstain or not vote its shares.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Filing Written Demand

Any holder of shares of our common stock wishing to exercise appraisal rights must deliver to the Company, before the vote on
the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, at the Special
Meeting at which the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
thereby will be submitted to the stockholders, a written demand for the appraisal of the stockholder’s shares, and that stockholder
must not vote or submit a proxy in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated thereby. A holder of shares of our common stock exercising appraisal rights must hold of record the
shares on the date the written demand for appraisal is made, and must continue to hold the shares of record through the Effective
Time. A proxy that is submitted and does not contain voting instructions will, unless revoked, be voted in favor of the adoption of
the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and it will constitute a waiver
of the stockholder’s right of appraisal and will nullify any previously delivered written demand for appraisal. Therefore, a
stockholder who submits a proxy and who wishes to exercise appraisal rights must submit a proxy containing instructions to vote
against the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby or
abstain from voting on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
thereby. Neither voting against the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby, nor abstaining from voting or failing to vote on the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby will, in and of itself, constitute a written demand for appraisal satisfying
the requirements of Section 262. The written demand for appraisal must be in addition to and separate from any proxy or vote on
the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. A stockholder’s
failure to make the written demand prior to the taking of the vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby at the Special Meeting will result in a loss of appraisal rights under the
DGCL.

Only a holder of record of shares of our common stock is entitled to demand appraisal rights for the shares registered in such
holder’s name. A demand for appraisal in respect of shares of our common stock should be executed by or on behalf of the holder
of record and must reasonably inform the Company of the identity of the holder and state that the person intends thereby to demand
appraisal of the holder’s shares of our common stock in connection with the Merger. If the shares of our common stock are owned
of record in a fiduciary capacity, such as by a trustee, guardian or custodian, such demand must be executed by or on behalf of the
record owner, and if the shares are owned of record by more than one person, as in a joint tenancy and tenancy in common, the
demand should be executed by or on behalf of all joint owners. An authorized agent, including an authorized agent for two or more
joint owners, may execute a demand for appraisal on behalf of a holder of record; however, the agent must identify the record
owner or owners and expressly disclose that, in executing the demand, the agent is acting as agent for the record owner or owners.

STOCKHOLDERS WHO HOLD THEIR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN BROKERAGE OR BANK ACCOUNTS
OR OTHER NOMINEE FORMS AND WHO WISH TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR
BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEES, AS APPLICABLE, TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE PROCEDURES FOR
THE BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE TO MAKE A DEMAND FOR APPRAISAL OF THOSE SHARES OF OUR
COMMON STOCK. A PERSON HAVING A BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK HELD OF
RECORD IN THE NAME OF ANOTHER PERSON, SUCH AS A BANK, BROKER OR OTHER NOMINEE, MUST ACT
PROMPTLY TO CAUSE THE RECORD HOLDER TO FOLLOW PROPERLY AND IN A TIMELY MANNER THE STEPS
NECESSARY TO PERFECT APPRAISAL RIGHTS.

All written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 should be delivered to:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Any holder of shares of our common stock may withdraw his, her or its demand for appraisal and accept the consideration
offered pursuant to the Merger Agreement by delivering to the Company a written withdrawal of the demand for appraisal.
However, any such attempt to withdraw the demand made more than 60 days after the Effective Time will require written approval
of the Surviving Corporation.

No appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery will be dismissed without the approval of the Court of Chancery, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court of Chancery deems just; provided, however, that such dismissal will not
affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to
withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the Merger within 60 days after the
Effective Time.

Notice by the Surviving Corporation

If the Merger is consummated, within ten days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will notify each holder of
shares of our common stock who has made a written demand for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 and who has not voted in favor
of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby that the
Merger has become effective and the effective date thereof, and include a copy in such notice of Section 262.

Filing a Petition for Appraisal

Within 120 days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any holder of shares of our common stock who has
complied with Section 262 and is entitled to exercise appraisal rights under Section 262 may commence an appraisal proceeding by
filing a petition in the Court of Chancery, with a copy served on the Surviving Corporation in the case of a petition filed by a
stockholder, demanding a determination of the fair value of the shares held by all stockholders entitled to appraisal. The Surviving
Corporation is under no obligation, and has no present intention, to file a petition, and holders should not assume that the Surviving
Corporation will file a petition or initiate any negotiations with respect to the fair value of the shares of our common stock.
Accordingly, any holders of shares of our common stock who desire to have their shares appraised should initiate all necessary
action to perfect their appraisal rights in respect of their shares of our common stock within the time and in the manner prescribed
by Section 262. The failure of a holder of shares of our common stock to file such a petition within the period specified in Section
262 will nullify the stockholder’s previous written demand for appraisal.

Within 120 days after the Effective Time, any holder of shares of our common stock who has complied with the requirements
for exercise of appraisal rights will be entitled, upon written request, to receive from the Surviving Corporation a statement setting
forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated thereby with respect to which the Company has received demands for appraisal, and the
aggregate number of holders of such shares. The Surviving Corporation must mail this statement to the requesting stockholder
within ten days after receipt of the written request for such a statement or within ten days after the expiration of the period for
delivery of demands for appraisal, whichever is later. A beneficial owner of shares held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on
behalf of such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition seeking appraisal or request from the Surviving Corporation
the foregoing statements. As noted above, however, the demand for appraisal can only be made by a stockholder of record.

If a petition for an appraisal is duly filed by a holder of shares of our common stock and a copy thereof is served upon the
Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation will then be obligated within 20 days after such service to file with the Delaware
Register in Chancery a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for
their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached. After notice to the stockholders as
required by the court, the Court of Chancery is empowered to conduct a hearing on the petition to determine those stockholders
who have complied with Section 262 and who have become entitled to exercise appraisal rights thereunder. The Court of Chancery
may require stockholders demanding appraisal of their shares to submit their stock certificates to the Register in Chancery for
notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings, and if any stockholder fails to comply with that direction, the Court
of Chancery may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Determination of Fair Value

After determining the holders of our common stock entitled to appraisal, the Court of Chancery will appraise the “fair value” of
the shares of our common stock, exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the Merger,
together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining fair value, the Court of
Chancery will take into account all relevant factors. Unless the court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown,
interest from the Effective Time through the date of payment of the judgment will be compounded quarterly and will accrue at 5%
over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the
Effective Time and the date of payment of the judgment. In Weinberger v. UOP, Inc., the Supreme Court of Delaware discussed the
factors that could be considered in determining fair value in an appraisal proceeding, stating that “proof of value by any techniques
or methods which are generally considered acceptable in the financial community and otherwise admissible in court” should be
considered, and that “[f]air price obviously requires consideration of all relevant factors involving the value of a company.” The
Delaware Supreme Court stated that, in making this determination of fair value, the court must consider market value, asset value,
dividends, earnings prospects, the nature of the enterprise and any other facts that could be ascertained as of the date of the merger
that throw any light on future prospects of the merged corporation. Section 262 provides that fair value is to be “exclusive of any
element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger.” In Cede & Co. v. Technicolor, Inc., the Delaware
Supreme Court stated that such exclusion is a “narrow exclusion [that] does not encompass known elements of value,” but which
rather applies only to the speculative elements of value arising from such accomplishment or expectation. In Weinberger, the
Supreme Court of Delaware also stated that “elements of future value, including the nature of the enterprise, which are known or
susceptible of proof as of the date of the merger and not the product of speculation, may be considered.”

Stockholders considering seeking appraisal should be aware that the fair value of their shares as so determined by the Court of
Chancery could be more than, the same as or less than the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger if they did not
seek appraisal of their shares and that an opinion of an investment banking firm as to the fairness from a financial point of view of
the consideration payable in a Merger is not an opinion as to, and does not in any manner address, fair value under Section 262.
Although the Company believes that the Merger Consideration is fair, no representation is made as to the outcome of the
appraisal of fair value as determined by the Court of Chancery, and stockholders should recognize that such an appraisal
could result in a determination of a value higher or lower than, or the same as, the Merger Consideration. Neither the
Company nor Parent anticipates offering more than the Merger Consideration to any stockholder exercising appraisal rights, and
each of the Company and Parent reserves the right to assert, in any appraisal proceeding, that for purposes of Section 262, the “fair
value” of a share of our common stock is less than the Merger Consideration. If a petition for appraisal is not timely filed, then the
right to an appraisal will cease. The costs of the appraisal proceedings (which do not include attorneys’ fees or the fees and
expenses of experts) may be determined by the Court of Chancery and taxed upon the parties as the Court of Chancery deems
equitable under the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court of Chancery may also order that all or a portion of
the expenses incurred by a stockholder in connection with an appraisal, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees
and the fees and expenses of experts, be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to be appraised.

If any stockholder who demands appraisal of his, her or its shares of our common stock under Section 262 fails to perfect, or
loses or successfully withdraws, such holder’s right to appraisal, such stockholder’s shares of our common stock will be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. A stockholder will fail to perfect, or
effectively lose or withdraw, the holder’s right to appraisal if no petition for appraisal is filed within 120 days after the Effective
Time or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the holder’s demand for appraisal and an
acceptance of the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 262.

From and after the Effective Time, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights will be entitled to vote such shares of our
common stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on our common stock, except dividends or
other distributions on the holder’s shares of our common stock, if any, payable to stockholders as of a time prior to the Effective
Time. If no petition for an

TABLE OF CONTENTS

appraisal is filed, or if the stockholder delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written withdrawal of the demand for an appraisal
and an acceptance of the Merger, either within 60 days after the Effective Time or thereafter with the written approval of the
Surviving Corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal will cease. Once a petition for appraisal is filed with the
Court of Chancery, however, the appraisal proceeding may not be dismissed as to any stockholder who commenced the proceeding
or joined that proceeding as a named party without the approval of the court.

Failure to comply exactly with all of the procedures set forth in Section 262 will result in the loss of a stockholder’s
statutory appraisal rights. Consequently, any stockholder wishing to exercise appraisal rights is encouraged to consult legal
counsel before attempting to exercise those rights.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

The following discussion is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be
relevant to certain U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) of shares of our common stock whose shares are
converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, court decisions, published positions of the Internal
Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other applicable authorities, all as in effect on the date of this proxy statement and all of which are
subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to holders who hold their
shares of our common stock as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for
investment purposes).

This discussion is for general information only and does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders
in light of their particular circumstances. For example, this discussion does not address:

• tax consequences that may be relevant to holders who may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax
laws, such as banks or other financial institutions; tax-exempt organizations; retirement plans or other tax-deferred
accounts; S-corporations or any other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or pass-through entities for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (and shareholders, partners or investors therein); insurance companies; mutual funds; brokers
or dealers in stocks or securities; traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their
securities; regulated investment companies; real estate investment trusts; entities subject to the U.S. anti-inversion rules;
personal holding companies; controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies or corporations that
accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; or certain former citizens, or long-term residents, of the United
States;

• tax consequences to holders holding the shares of our common stock as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion,
straddle or other risk reduction transaction;

• tax consequences to holders that received their shares of our common stock on exercise of notes, warrants or options,
through a tax qualified retirement plan, or otherwise in a compensatory transaction;

• tax consequences to holders who own an equity interest, actually or constructively, in HPE or the Surviving Corporation
following the Merger;

• tax consequences to U.S. Holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar;

• tax consequences to holders who hold their shares of our common stock through a bank, financial institution or other entity,
or a branch thereof, located, organized or resident outside the United States;

• tax consequences to holders who hold their shares of our common stock as “qualified small business stock” within the
meaning of Section 1202 of the Code or Section 1244 Stock for purposes of the Code;

• tax consequences to holders of their shares of our common stock who demand appraisal rights under Delaware law;

• the U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences, if any; or

• any state, local or foreign tax consequences.

If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement, domestic or foreign, treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) is a beneficial owner (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of shares of our common stock, then the tax treatment of a
partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership.
Partnerships holding shares of our common stock and partners (or persons treated as partners for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
therein should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the Merger.

No ruling from the IRS and no opinion of counsel has been or will be obtained regarding the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of the Merger described below. No assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the views expressed in this
summary. If the IRS contests a conclusion set forth herein, no assurance can be given that a holder would ultimately prevail in a
final determination by a court.

THIS DISCUSSION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE
LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE TO ANY HOLDER. A HOLDER SHOULD CONSULT SUCH HOLDER’S OWN TAX
ADVISORS CONCERNING THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE MERGER IN
LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ANY CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER U.S. FEDERAL
NON-INCOME TAX LAWS OR THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, OR FOREIGN TAXING JURISDICTION,
INCLUDING POSSIBLE CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS.

U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner (for U.S. federal income tax purposes) of shares of our
common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

• a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under
the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

• an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

• a trust (i) if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary jurisdiction over its administration and one or more
United States persons, as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, have the authority to control all of its substantial
decisions; or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States
person.

The receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable
transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, such U.S. Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference, if any,
between the amount of cash received and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares surrendered pursuant to the Merger. A
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis generally will equal the amount that such U.S. Holder paid for the shares. Such gain or loss will be
capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. Holder’s holding period in such shares is more than one
year at the time of the consummation of the Merger. A reduced tax rate on capital gain generally will apply to long-term capital
gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder (including individuals). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Gain or loss
realized generally must be calculated separately for each block of shares (i.e., shares acquired at the same cost in a single
transaction) surrendered pursuant to the Merger.

Additionally, a 3.8% tax generally is imposed on all or a portion of the “net investment income” (within the meaning of the
Code) of certain individuals and on the undistributed net investment income of certain estates and trusts. For individuals, the
additional 3.8% tax generally is imposed on all or a portion of the net investment income of individuals with a modified adjusted
gross income of over $200,000 ($250,000 in the case of joint filers). For these purposes, “net investment income” generally will
include any gain recognized on the receipt of cash in exchange for shares of our common stock pursuant to the Merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Non-U.S. Holders

For purposes of this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner (for U.S. federal income tax purposes)
of shares of our common stock that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Non-U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax consequences
that may be relevant to them in light of their particular circumstances. Any gain realized by a Non-U.S. Holder pursuant to the
Merger generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

• the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of such Non-U.S. Holder in the United States (and, if required by
an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such Non-U.S.
Holder in the United States), in which case such gain generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income
basis at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons, and, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, such gain may also be
subject to the branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty);

• such Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that
disposition, and certain other specified conditions are met, in which case such gain will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty) and may be offset by certain U.S. source capital
losses; or

• the Company is or has been a “United States real property holding corporation” as such term is defined in Section 897(c) of
the Code at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the Merger or such Non-U.S. Holder’s holding
period with respect to the applicable shares of our common stock and certain other requirements are met, in which case such
gain will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at rates generally applicable to U.S. persons (as described in the first bullet
point above except that the branch profits tax will not apply). We believe that we are not, and have not been, a USRPHC at
any time during the five-year period preceding the Merger.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

Information reporting and backup withholding (at a current rate of 28%) may apply to the proceeds received by a holder
pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding generally will not apply to (i) a U.S. Holder that furnishes a correct taxpayer
identification number and certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on a properly completed IRS Form W-9
(or a substitute or successor form) or (ii) a Non-U.S. Holder that (A) provides a certification of such holder’s foreign status on a
properly completed appropriate series of IRS Form W-8 (or a substitute or successor form) or (B) otherwise establishes an
exemption from backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a
credit against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

THE FOREGOING SUMMARY DOES NOT DISCUSS ALL ASPECTS OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXATION THAT
MAY BE RELEVANT TO PARTICULAR HOLDERS OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. HOLDERS OF SHARES
ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF
THE RECEIPT OF CASH FOR THEIR SHARES PURSUANT TO THE MERGER UNDER ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE,
LOCAL, FOREIGN OR OTHER TAX LAWS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE CHANGES IN SUCH LAWS.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger

Parent and the Company have generally agreed to (and Parent has agreed to cause Sub and each of Parent’s and Sub’s affiliated
investment funds to and the Company has agreed to cause each of its subsidiaries to) use their reasonable best efforts to promptly
obtain all necessary actions or approvals from governmental entities to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. These approvals (i) include that the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act has
expired or been terminated (early termination of the waiting period was granted on July 25, 2017); and (ii) may include the
approval or clearance of the Merger pursuant to antitrust laws of potentially other jurisdictions (collectively, the “foreign
jurisdictions”) as required.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HSR Act and U.S. Antitrust Matters

Under the HSR Act and the rules promulgated thereunder, the Merger cannot be consummated until Parent and the Company, or
their “ultimate parent entities,” file a notification and report form with the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) under the HSR Act and the applicable waiting period has expired or been
terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be consummated until the expiration of waiting period following
the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms (typically a 30-day period) or the early termination of that waiting
period. On July 14, 2017, both the Company and Parent filed their respective Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the
DOJ, which triggered the start of the HSR Act 30-day waiting period. On July 25, 2017, the FTC granted early termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act.

At any time before or after consummation of the Merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary under the applicable statutes,
including seeking to enjoin the consummation of the Merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the
parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the
consummation of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state could take
such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the consummation of the
Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties, or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or
terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws
under certain circumstances.

Foreign Competition Laws

Under the competition laws of certain foreign jurisdictions, certain competition law filings may be necessary. Parent and the
Company, or their “ultimate parent entities,” have not yet made the necessary filings as dictated by the competition laws of foreign
jurisdictions.

Other Regulatory Approvals

One or more governmental agencies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants
the necessary approvals and consents. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or
overturn regulatory approvals, any of which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory
approvals. There is currently no way to predict how long it will take to obtain all of the required regulatory approvals or whether
such approvals will ultimately be obtained and there may be a substantial period of time between the approval by stockholders and
the consummation of the Merger.

Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained, we cannot assure you that these
regulatory clearances and approvals will be timely obtained, obtained at all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and
approvals will not involve the imposition of additional conditions on the consummation of the Merger, including the requirement to
divest assets, or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement. These conditions or changes could result in the conditions
to the Merger not being satisfied.

Litigation Related to the Merger

On July 27, 2017, a putative class action lawsuit, captioned Derrick McNeil v. West Marine, Inc., et al., 1:17-cv-01036-RGA,
was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the Company and its directors in connection with
the Merger. A second putative class action lawsuit, captioned Daniel Greenberg v. West Marine, Inc., et al., 4:17-cv-04345-HSG,
was filed on July 31, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company and its
directors in connection with the Merger. A third putative class action lawsuit, captioned Paul Parshall v. West Marine, Inc., et al.,
5:17-cv-04522, was filed on August 8, 2017 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against the
Company and its directors, as well as Monomoy, Parent and Sub, in connection with the Merger. All three lawsuits allege, among
other things, that the Company and its directors violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, by omitting certain information from
the preliminary proxy statement filed on July 24, 2017 with the SEC in connection with the Merger. The Parshall lawsuit

additionally alleges that the Company’s directors, Monomoy, Parent and Sub are liable as control persons under Section 20(a) of
the Exchange Act for the Company’s violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act. All three lawsuits seek, among other things,
equitable relief that would enjoin consummation of the Merger, an accounting for any damages suffered by the plaintiffs and the
class as a result of the defendants’ alleged wrongdoing, and attorneys’ fees and costs.

In addition, on July 27, 2017, a putative class action lawsuit, captioned George Patterson v. Randolph K. Repass, et al.,
17CV01995, was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Cruz against the Company’s directors in
connection with the Merger. The lawsuit alleges that the Company’s directors were conflicted and breached their fiduciary duties to
stockholders by, among other things, seeking to sell the Company through an allegedly unfair process, for an unfair price and on
unfair terms, and because the preliminary proxy statement omitted certain information. The lawsuit seeks, among other things,
equitable relief that would enjoin consummation of the Merger, rescission of the Merger Agreement (to the extent it has already
been implemented) or rescissory damages, an accounting for any damages suffered by the plaintiff and the class as a result of the
defendants’ alleged wrongdoing, and attorneys’ fees and costs.

The Company and its directors believe that the foregoing lawsuits are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the
actions.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement
in this summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and is incorporated into this proxy statement
by reference. We encourage you to read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety because this summary may not contain
all the information about the Merger Agreement that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed
by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this summary or any other information contained in this proxy
statement. Capitalized terms in this section but not defined in this proxy statement have the meaning ascribed to such terms
in the Merger Agreement.

The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described in this section and included in the Merger Agreement (i)
were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates, (ii) were made solely for the benefit of the parties
to the Merger Agreement and (iii) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to
by Parent, the Company and Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. The representations and
warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and
documents filed with the SEC and, in some cases, were qualified by matters disclosed to Parent and Sub by the Company in the
disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement. In addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger
Agreement for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement, rather than to establish
matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to such parties that differ from those applicable to
investors. Stockholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the
Company, Parent or Sub or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of
the representations and warranties may have changed after the date of the Merger Agreement and do not purport to be accurate as
of the date of this proxy statement and, accordingly, you should not rely on such representations and warranties as characterizations
of the actual state of facts as of the date of this proxy statement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger
Agreement as actual limitations on the respective businesses of the Company, Parent and Sub because the parties may take certain
actions that are either expressly permitted in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company in connection with the execution of the
Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the
public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its
terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information regarding the Company, Parent, Sub or their
respective businesses or affiliates. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the Merger
Agreement should not be read alone and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings
with the SEC regarding the Company and our business.

Form and Effects of the Merger; Directors and Officers; Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Sub, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, will merge with and into the Company. The separate corporate existence of Sub
will cease, and the Company will continue as the Surviving Corporation and will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Sub, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub will become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation will be amended and restated in its entirety
to read as set forth in Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will be amended and
restated in their entirety to conform to the bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the
references to the name of Sub will be replaced by references to “West Marine, Inc.”), in each case, until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable law and the applicable provisions thereof.

From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation. The directors and officers will serve in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

Closing and Effective Time of the Merger

Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties to the Merger Agreement, the closing of the Merger is expected to occur at
9:00 a.m. New York City time on the date that is two business days following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) of the conditions to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement and described in the section captioned “The
Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Merger” (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of
the Merger, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the closing of the Merger).

The Merger will become effective upon the filing of the certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or at such later date and time as is agreed upon by Parent and the Company and specified in the certificate of merger in
accordance with the DGCL. As of the date of this proxy statement, we expect to consummate the Merger in the third quarter of
fiscal year 2017; however, consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law)
waiver of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger more fully described in the section captioned “The Merger
Agreement —  Conditions to the Merger” and we cannot specify when, or assure you that, the Company and Parent will satisfy or
waive all or any conditions to the Merger. There may be a substantial amount of time between the date of the Special Meeting and
the consummation of the Merger and it is possible that factors outside the control of the Company or Parent could delay the
consummation of the Merger, or prevent the Merger from being consummated; however, we expect to consummate the Merger
promptly following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waiver of the conditions more fully described
below in the section captioned “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to the Merger.”

Merger Consideration

Effect of the Merger on the Company’s Capital Stock

At the Effective Time, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including any shares resulting from the settlement of RSUs which become settlable as of the consummation of the Merger and any
shares issued upon the exercise of Options, but excluding Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and will
automatically be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration of $12.97 in cash, without interest, and subject to
deduction for any required withholding tax. At the Effective Time, all of the Cancelled Shares will be automatically canceled and
retired without payment of any consideration. Each Dissenting Share will not be converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration, unless and until such stockholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such stockholder’s right to
appraisal under the DGCL, at which time each such share of our common stock will be converted into and exchangeable only for
the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to appraisal is irrevocably lost, the Merger
Consideration. Dissenting shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262, as more fully described in the section captioned
“The Merger —  Appraisal Rights.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Treatment of the Company Equity-Based Awards

The Merger Agreement provides that the Company’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be subject to the following treatment at the Effective Time:

Options

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Option that is then outstanding will be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each
holder of any such cancelled Option will be entitled to receive payment of an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total
number of shares of our common stock subject to such Option, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration
over (B) the exercise price per share subject to such cancelled Option, without interest; provided, however, that (i) any such Option
with respect to which the exercise price per share subject thereto is greater than the Merger Consideration will be cancelled in
exchange for no consideration and (ii) such option payments may be reduced by the amount of any required tax withholdings as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Employee RSUs

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of unvested RSUs (including PSUs) granted under the Company Equity
Incentive Plan, that is then outstanding (other than those RSUs held by a non-employee director of the Company) will be assumed
by the Surviving Corporation and will be converted into a Cash Replacement Company RSU. Such Cash Replacement Company
RSUs will, subject to the holder’s continued employment with the Surviving Company through the applicable vesting dates, vest
and be payable at the same time as the RSUs for such Cash Replacement Company RSUs were exchanged would have vested
pursuant to their terms. All Cash Replacement Company RSUs will have the same terms and conditions as applied to the RSUs for
which they were exchanged, except for terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement or for administrative or ministerial changes that are not materially detrimental to the holders and that are necessary for
the administration of the Cash Replacement Company RSUs. With respect to PSUs, the number of PSUs assumed by the Surviving
Corporation and converted into Cash Replacement Company RSUs will be determined (A) for PSUs with a performance period
that by its terms has ended prior to the Effective Time, based on actual performance through the end of such performance period,
and (B) for PSUs with a performance period that by its terms has not ended prior to the Effective Time, assuming performance at
100% of target levels.

Non-Employee Director RSUs

Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of unvested RSUs granted under the Company Equity Incentive Plan that
is then outstanding and is held by a non-employee director of the Company will be fully vested and cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each holder of any such cancelled RSUs will be entitled to receive payment of an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of our common stock subject to such RSUs, without
interest; provided, however, that any such RSU payments may be reduced by the amount of any required tax withholdings as
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

SPP Options

The SPP will be terminated prior to the Effective Time and the Company will take all action necessary to (i) cause any
outstanding offering period under the SPP to be terminated prior to the Effective Time, (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may
be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period, (iii) provide that all outstanding SPP Options will be canceled as of the
closing date of the Merger, provided that each holder of an SPP Option may exercise each outstanding purchase right under the SPP
prior to the Effective Time, (iv) provide that no further offering period or purchase period will commence under the SPP after the
date of the Merger Agreement and (v) ensure that no individual may make a new election to purchase shares in any current offering
period or increase his or her election to purchase shares in any current offering period. On such new exercise date, the Company
shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the SPP within each participant’s payroll withholding account to the purchase
of whole shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the SPP.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Exchange and Payment Procedures

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will designate and deposit with a U.S.-based nationally recognized financial institution
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Paying Agent”) cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to
stockholders pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (the “Exchange Fund”). In the event that the Exchange Fund becomes
insufficient to make such payments, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent
in an amount sufficient to make such payments.

As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than the second business day following the Effective
Time), Parent will cause the Paying Agent to mail to each person who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, was a holder of
record of certificate(s) (a “certificate”) representing outstanding shares of our common stock that were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the certificate in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration.

Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a certificate along with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and
such other documents as may be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such certificate will be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration for each share formerly represented by such certificate (other than with respect to Dissenting Shares and Cancelled
Shares), subject to deduction for any required withholding tax and without interest. Payment of the Merger Consideration with
respect to non-certificated shares of our common stock represented by book-entry (the “book-entry shares”) (other than with
respect to Dissenting Shares and Cancelled Shares) will only be made to the person in whose name such book-entry shares are
registered and will be made promptly following the Effective Time without any action on the part of the person in whose name
such book-entry shares are registered, subject to deduction for any required withholding tax and without interest.

Certificates should not be surrendered by stockholders prior to the Effective Time and should be sent only pursuant to
instructions set forth in the letters of transmittal to be mailed to stockholders as promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time.

The letter of transmittal will include instructions of the procedures to be taken by a holder of a certificate if such holder has lost
a certificate or if such certificate has been stolen or destroyed. In the event any certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Paying Agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger Consideration, require
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond in a customary
amount.

If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the surrendered certificate is
registered, then, as a condition of payment of the Merger Consideration, the surrendered certificate is properly endorsed or is
otherwise in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer and other
similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the
certificate so surrendered or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such taxes either have been paid
or are not required to be paid.

The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement upon surrender of any shares of our
common stock shall represent full payment and satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of our common stock. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of our common stock except as otherwise provided for in the Merger Agreement or
by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in the Merger Agreement,

Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) that is not distributed to holders of
shares of our common stock following the first anniversary of the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation
upon demand, and any remaining holders of shares of our common stock will thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender
of their shares of our

common stock, without interest. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent will be liable
to any holder or former holder of our common stock or to any other person or entity with respect to any cash amounts properly
delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat or similar laws.

Withholding

Each of Parent, the surviving corporation, the Company, Sub and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of shares of our common stock, Options or RSUs such amounts for taxes that it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to making such payment, or the vesting, waiver or restrictions or other actions
provided for in the Merger Agreement, under all applicable tax laws.

Representations and Warranties

The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties of the Company, Parent and Sub.

Some of the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement made by the Company are qualified as to “materiality” or
“Company Material Adverse Effect.” For purposes of the Merger Agreement, “Company Material Adverse Effect” means, with
respect to the Company, any change, circumstance, development, occurrence, state of facts, event or effect that has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate together with all other changes, circumstances, developments,
occurrences, states of facts, events or effects, a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or continuing results of
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, however, that none of the following shall constitute or
be taken into account in determining whether there has been, a “Company Material Adverse Effect”:

• the entry into or the announcement or pendency of the Merger Agreement or the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, in each case, including (i) by reason of the identity of, or any facts or circumstances relating to, Parent,
Sub or any of their respective affiliates, (ii) by reason of any communication by Parent or any of its affiliates regarding the
plans or intentions of Parent with respect to the conduct of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries following the
Effective Time and (iii) the impact of any of the foregoing on any relationships with customers, suppliers, vendors, business
partners, employees or regulators;

• any change, circumstance, development, occurrence, state of facts, event or effect affecting the economy or the financial,
credit or securities markets in the United States or elsewhere in the world (including interest rates and exchange rates)
generally affecting the industries in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries operates, except to the extent they
materially and disproportionately adversely affect the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, compared to other
companies operating primarily in the same industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate;

• the suspension of trading in securities generally on the NASDAQ;

• any development or change in applicable Law, GAAP or accounting standards or the interpretation of any of the foregoing,
except to the extent they materially and disproportionately adversely affect the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, compared to other companies operating primarily in the same industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries
operate;

• any action taken by the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is expressly required by the Merger Agreement or at
Parent’s request or the failure by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to take any action that is prohibited by the Merger
Agreement (including, if applicable, to the extent Parent fails to provide its consent to such action after receipt of a written
request therefor);

• the commencement, occurrence, continuation or escalation of any armed hostilities or acts of war (whether or not declared)
or terrorism, except to the extent they materially and disproportionately adversely affect the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, compared to other companies operating primarily in the same industries in which the Company and its
subsidiaries operate;

• any actions or claims made or brought by any of the current or former Company stockholders (or on their behalf or on
behalf of the Company, but in any event only in their capacities as current or former stockholders) arising out of the Merger
Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

• the existence, occurrence or continuation of any weather-related or force majeure events, including any earthquakes, floods,
hurricanes, tropical storms, fires or other natural disasters or any national, international or regional calamity, except to the
extent they materially and disproportionately adversely affect the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, compared
to other companies operating primarily in the same industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate; or

• any changes in the market price or trading volume of the shares of our common stock, any changes in the ratings or the
ratings outlook for the Company or any of its subsidiaries by any applicable rating agency, any changes in any analyst’s
recommendations or ratings with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any failure of the Company to meet
any internal or external projections, budgets, guidance, forecasts or estimates of revenues, earnings or other metrics for any
period ending on or after the date of the Merger Agreement (it being understood that the exceptions in this clause shall not
prevent or otherwise affect the underlying cause of any such change or failure referred to therein (to the extent not
otherwise falling within any of the exceptions provided by the foregoing clauses) from being taken into account in
determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred).

In the Merger Agreement, the Company has made representations and warranties to Parent and Sub that are subject, in some
cases, to specified exceptions and qualifications contained in the Merger Agreement. These representations and warranties relate to,
among other things:

• due organization, valid existence, good standing and authority and qualification to conduct business with respect to the
Company and its subsidiaries;

• the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the equivalent governing documents of its subsidiaries;

• the capital structure of the Company as well as the ownership and capital structure of its subsidiaries;

• the Company’s corporate power and authority to enter into and perform the Merger Agreement and the enforceability of the
Merger Agreement;

• the Board’s approval and recommendation of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement;

• the absence of any conflicts with, or violations of, laws, organizational documents or the Company’s material contracts or
the creation of encumbrances upon the properties, assets or rights pursuant to the Company’s material contracts, in each

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Restriction on Solicitation of Competing Proposals

Except as permitted by the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries and its
and their respective directors, officers, employees, managers, consultants, accountants, advisors, investment bankers and counsel
(collectively, the “representatives”) to:

• cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing with respect to any Competing
Proposal (as defined below); and

• terminate “data room” access for such persons and their representatives and request the prompt return or destruction of any
non-public information regarding the company or its subsidiaries furnished to such persons and their representatives.

Except as permitted by the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company has also agreed that it will not, and will cause each of
its subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives not to:

• initiate, solicit, facilitate, or knowingly encourage the submission of any Competing Proposal;

• furnish any non-public information regarding the Company or any of its subsidiaries to any third person in connection with
or in response to a Competing Proposal;

• participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third person with respect to any Competing Proposal;

• terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any confidentiality agreement or standstill
agreement to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is party;

• waive the applicability of all or any portion of any takeover statute in respect of any person; or

• resolve to agree to take any of the foregoing actions.

Notwithstanding the restrictions described above, the Company may furnish information with respect to it and its subsidiaries
to, and participate in discussions or negotiations with, the person making a Competing Proposal and such person’s representatives
regarding such Competing Proposal if:

• the Company has received a bona fide written Competing Proposal that did not result from a material breach of the non-
solicitation provisions of the Merger Agreement, which Competing Proposal is made on or after the date of the Merger
Agreement and prior to the Special Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof); and

• the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Competing
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below) and that failure to
take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under law.

When furnishing any such non-public information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person, the
Company will: (i) not, not permit its subsidiaries, and not authorize its representatives to, disclose any non-public information
regarding the Company to such person without first entering into an acceptable confidentiality agreement with such person that
contains substantially similar terms to those contained in the confidentiality agreement entered into by and between the Company
and Monomoy (an “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement”); (ii) promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) advise Parent in
writing of the receipt of any Competing Proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal
and shall disclose to Parent the material terms of any such Competing Proposal (but shall have no obligation to disclose to Parent
the identity of any person making such Competing Proposal or the terms thereof); (iii) keep Parent informed in all material respects
on a prompt basis of any material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding such Competing Proposal; and (iv) as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours thereafter) provide to Parent any information concerning the Company or
its subsidiaries provided or made available to such other person (or its representatives) that was not previously provided or made
available to Parent.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A “Competing Proposal” means, other than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, any proposal, inquiry,
indication of interest or offer, from any person or group of persons (other than Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates)
relating to, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, (i) the direct or indirect acquisition (whether by merger,
consolidation, equity investment, joint venture, recapitalization, reorganization or otherwise) by any person or group of persons of
more than 20% of the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) the acquisition in any manner,
directly or indirectly, by any person or group of persons of more than 20% of any class of equity securities of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or (iii) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
that would result in any person or group of persons beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the voting power
of the surviving entity in a merger involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the
Company or such surviving entity (or any securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities representing such voting
power).

A “Superior Proposal” means an unsolicited Competing Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Competing Proposal
increased to 50%), which was not obtained or made as a result of a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger
Agreement, made by any person on terms that the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company’s financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, and considering such factors as the Board considers to be appropriate, are (i) more favorable to
the Company and its stockholders from a financial perspective than the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (ii)
reasonably capable of being completed in accordance with its terms.

Obligation of the Board with respect to Its Recommendation

In addition, except as permitted by the Merger Agreement, neither the Board nor any of its committees will: (i) adopt, authorize,
approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any Competing Proposal; (ii) following the public
announcement of a Competing Proposal, at the written request of Parent, fail to reaffirm publicly the Company Recommendation
(as defined in the Merger Agreement and described in the section captioned “The Merger Agreement — Obligations with respect to
this Proxy Statement and the Special Meeting”) within ten business days after Parent’s written request to do so (provided, however,
that Parent shall be entitled to make such written request for reaffirmation only once as to each Competing Proposal unless the
price contemplated by such Competing Proposal is increased); (iii) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange
relating to the shares of our common stock by a person unaffiliated with Parent, fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation and
recommend that the Company stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within ten business days after the
commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer; (iv) withhold, change, modify, amend or otherwise propose publicly to
withdraw, change, modify, amend, in each case, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or fail to include the
Company Recommendation in this proxy statement (any of the foregoing, a “Change of Company Recommendation”); or (v) allow
the Company or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to any Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company is permitted to: (i) take and disclose to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) issue a
“stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that a position disclosed pursuant to clause (i) shall not be deemed a Change of
Company Recommendation if it includes either an express rejection of any applicable Competing Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation; provided, further, that the Company may not make a Change of Company
Recommendation except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Furthermore, at any time prior to obtaining approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company stockholders, the Board may
make a Change of Company Recommendation if:

• (i) a Competing Proposal (that did not result from a material breach of the non-solicitation provisions of the Merger) is
made to the Company after the date of the Merger Agreement by a third person and such Competing Proposal is not
withdrawn and (ii) the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;

• the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the Company’s intention to make a Change of Company
Recommendation (the “Notice of Change of Recommendation”) no less than three business days prior to the Board making
a Change of Company Recommendation, which notice shall identify the person making such Superior Proposal and include
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (it being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by the
Company nor the public announcement that the Board has received or is evaluating a Competing Proposal, in and of itself,
shall constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

• the Company has (to the extent requested by Parent) negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to any changes to the
terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent during such three business days prior to making such Change of
Company Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Change of Recommendation and an additional two-day period from the date of such
notice); and

• taking into account any changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement offered by Parent in writing to the Company, the
Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that such
Competing Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal even if such changes offered in writing by Parent
were to be given effect.

In addition, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the Board may make a Change of Company Recommendation if:

• there shall occur or arise after the date of the Merger Agreement a material development or material change in
circumstances (or if such material development or material change in circumstances occurred or arose on or prior to the date
of the Merger Agreement, the material consequences of which are not known to the Board as of the date of the Merger
Agreement and only become known to the Board prior to the Effective Time), in each case, that was not reasonably
foreseeable and that relates to the Company or any of its subsidiaries but does not relate to any Competing Proposal (each,
an “Intervening Event”);

• the Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that, in light of
such Intervening Event, the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent
would, if the Merger Agreement were not amended or an alternative transaction with Parent were not entered into, be
inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary obligations to the Company stockholders under applicable law;

• the Company provides Parent a Notice of Change of Recommendation, which notice shall describe the Intervening Event (it
being agreed that neither the delivery of the Notice of Change of Recommendation by the Company nor the public
announcement that the Board is considering making a Change of Company Recommendation under applicable law will
constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• the Company has (to the extent requested by Parent) negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to any changes to the
terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by Parent for at least three business days following receipt by Parent of such
Notice of Change of Recommendation; and

• taking into account any changes to the terms of Merger Agreement offered by Parent in writing to the Company, the Board
has determined in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to
withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Board’s fiduciary obligations to the
Company stockholders under applicable law in light of such Intervening Event.

Obligations with respect to this Proxy Statement and the Special Meeting

The Merger Agreement requires that the Company, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of the Merger
Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC this proxy statement. Parent is required to cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of this proxy statement and is required to furnish all information concerning it and Sub as may be required to be set
forth in this proxy statement under applicable law. The Company is required, with Parent’s cooperation, to use commercially
reasonable efforts to have this proxy statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable. The Company is required
to, as soon as reasonably practicable after this proxy statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the Company stockholders, duly
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders to consider the adoption of the Merger Agreement. The Board will,
subject to the right of the Board to make a Change of Company Recommendation pursuant to the provisions described in the
section captioned “The Merger Agreement —  Obligation of the Board with respect to Its Recommendation,” recommend to the
Company stockholders that the Requisite Stockholder Approval be given (the “Company Recommendation”). The Company will
include the Company Recommendation in the proxy statement.

The Company may delay or postpone convening the stockholders’ meeting (i) with consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of a
quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company has determined
in god faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) is necessary under applicable law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company stockholders prior to the stockholders’ meeting, or (iv) to allow
additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

Access to Information

Until the Effective Time or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, subject to certain express
exceptions, the Company is required to, and is required to cause each of its subsidiaries to, provide to Parent, Sub and their
respective representatives reasonable access during normal business hours in such manner as not to interfere with the operation of
any business conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, upon prior written notice to the Company, to the Company’s and
its subsidiaries’ officers, employees, properties, offices and other facilities and to their books and records, and furnish promptly
such information concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries as Parent
or its representatives may reasonably request.

Efforts to Consummate the Merger

Subject to provisions relating to a Change of Company Recommendation, each of the Company and Parent is required to (and
Parent is required to cause each of its affiliated investment funds to) use reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and to cause the conditions to Parent’s, Sub’s and the Company’s
obligations to effect the Merger to be satisfied. Parent is required to (and is required to cause Sub and each of Parent’s and Sub’s
affiliated investment funds to) and the Company is required to (and is required to cause each of its subsidiaries to) use reasonable
best effectors to (i) promptly obtain all actions or nonactions, consents, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations and orders from
governmental entities or other persons necessary or advisable in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten business days after the date of
the Merger Agreement, make and not withdraw all registrations and filings with any governmental entity or other persons necessary
or advisable in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the filings

required under the HSR Act or any other antitrust law, (iii) defend all lawsuits or other legal, regulatory, administrative or other
proceedings to which it or any of its affiliates is a party challenging or affecting the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (iv) seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining order
adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (v) seek to
resolve any objection or assertion by any governmental entity challenging the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, and (vi) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Each party is required to consult and cooperate with the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis, appearance,
presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any governmental entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Each party is required to notify and keep the other parties informed as of
the status of any request, inquiry, investigation or legal proceeding by or before any governmental entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In addition, each party is required to promptly inform the other parties of any
communication to or from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other governmental entity regarding the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

Directors’ and Officers’ Indemnification and Insurance

From and after the Effective Time, Parent is required to, and is required to cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the extent
provided in the organizational documents of the Company and its subsidiaries in effect as of the date of the Merger Agreement,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current or former director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries against (i)
losses, expenses, judgments, fines, claims, damages or liabilities (including amounts paid in settlement) arising out of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the extent that they are based on or arise out of the fact that such person is
or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the “Indemnified Liabilities”), and (ii) all Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent that they are based on or arise out of or pertain to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

The Company is permitted to, prior to the Effective Time, and if the Company fails to do so, Parent is obligated to cause the
Surviving Corporation to obtain and fully pay the premium for an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for a
period of six years from the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the Effective Time that is substantially equivalent to and in
any event no less favorable in the aggregate to the intended beneficiaries thereof than the Company’s existing directors’ and
officers’ liability insurance policy. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such a “tail”
insurance policy as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation is required to, and Parent is required to cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time (and for so long thereafter
as any claims brought before the end of such six-year period thereunder are being adjudicated) such insurance in place as of the
date of the Merger Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in
the Company’s existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement. Alternatively, the Surviving Corporation is obligated to,
and Parent is obligated to cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for
such six-year period (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six-year period thereunder are being
adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s
existing policies as of the date of the Merger Agreement.

Furthermore, for at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation

of expenses for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the organizational documents of the
Company and its subsidiaries. The Merger Agreement also provides that the indemnification rights set forth in the indemnification
agreements, the form of which was filed as an exhibit to the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Financing Covenants

The consummation of the Merger is not conditioned upon Parent’s or Sub’s receipt of the equity financing or any other
financing. However, under the Merger Agreement, Parent and Sub are obligated to use their reasonable best efforts to arrange the
equity financing and debt financings on the terms and conditions described in the original equity commitment letter and debt
commitment letters. Parent will not permit any amendment or modification of, or any waiver or consent under, any provision of the
original equity commitment letter or debt commitment letters or other documentation relating to the financings without the prior
written consent of the Company if such amendment, modification, waiver or consent would (i) reasonably be expected to adversely
affect Parent’s or Sub’s ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) reduce the aggregate
amount of the financing to fund the amounts required to be paid by Parent or Sub under the Merger Agreement below the amounts
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (iii) impose new or additional conditions or
expand upon (or amend or modify in any manner adverse to the interests of the Company) the conditions precedent to the
financings as set forth in the original equity commitment letter or debt commitment letters or other documentation relating to the
financings, (iv) reasonably be expected to delay the closing of the Merger, or (v) amend any remedies available in respect of the
debt financing.

Subject to certain exceptions, on or prior to the closing, the Company must use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide,
or cause its representatives to provide, to Parent and Sub, at Parent’s sole expense, customary cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent and Sub in connection with the arrangement, syndication and consummation of the debt financing. Parent has agreed to
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation and to indemnify the Company, its subsidiaries and their respective
representatives against losses incurred in connection with the arrangement of the debt financing and any information used in
connection therewith.

Employee Benefits

For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent is required to provide, or is required to cause its subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to provide, each employee of the Company or its subsidiaries who continues to be employed
by the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary thereof with (i) base salary, wages and cash-based commission opportunities at a
rate that is substantially comparable in the aggregate to the rate of base salary, wages or commission opportunities provided to such
employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual bonus opportunity that is substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the annual cash-based bonus opportunity provided to such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (iii)
severance benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the severance benefits provided under the severance plan,
policy or agreement in effect for the benefit of such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) other benefits
(including paid-time off, but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, equity incentive compensation) that are substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to the other compensation and benefits provided to such employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time under the Company’s benefit plans.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and continue all of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ employment,
severance, retention and termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements in existence as of the date of the
Merger Agreement, in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and, for a period of one year
following the Effective Time, shall do so without any amendment or modification, other than any amendment or modification
required to comply with applicable law or as permitted pursuant to the terms of the applicable plans, policies, programs,
agreements and arrangements.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

For purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and, with respect to vacation and severance only, determination of the level of
benefits under Parent’s and its subsidiaries’ benefit plans providing benefits to any continuing employees after the Effective Time,
continuing employees will be credited for service with or recognized by the Company and its subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time to the extent that credit for such service is recognized under corresponding benefit plans of the Company or its subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that credit for such service will not apply with respect to benefit accruals under any
equity based compensation plan, long-term incentive plan, defined benefit pension plan, retiree plan or welfare plan, or if credit for
such service would result in a duplication of benefits.

Additionally, Parent shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to use commercially reasonable
efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation,
in which continuing employees (and his or her covered dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time,
except to the extent such pre-exiting condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not
have been satisfied or waived under the comparable benefit plans of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent
shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount
of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each continuing employee (and his or her eligible dependents)
during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year’s deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such continuing employee (and dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time.

Securityholder Litigation

The Company is required to promptly advise Parent of any litigation commenced after the date of the Merger Agreement
against the Company or any of its directors by any of its stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company) to the
extent relating to the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and to keep Parent reasonably
and regularly informed regarding any such litigation. The Company may not settle any such litigation without the prior written
consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Other Covenants and Agreements

The Merger Agreement contains other covenants to and agreements regarding various other matters, including:

• public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

• state anti-takeover or other similar laws;

• the Company’s ability to take all actions reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that dispositions of equity securities of
the Company (including derivative securities) by any officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the
Exchange Act pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act; and

• each party being responsible for costs and expenses incurred by it in connection with the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the responsibility of Parent, Sub and, after the closing of the
Merger, the Surviving Corporation, for all transfer taxes incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement.

30 calendar days after delivery of notice by the Company to Parent; provided that this termination right will not be
available to the Company if any breach by the Company of any representation, warranty or covenant in the Merger
Agreement would result in certain conditions to the Merger not being satisfied; or

• (i) all conditions to Parent’s and Sub’s obligations to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived (other than those

Effect of Termination

If the Merger Agreement is terminated, the Merge Agreement will become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on

except that certain provisions of the Merger Agreement, including each party’s acknowledgement of absence of other
representations and warranties made by the other parties other than those set forth in the Merger Agreement, the Limited Guarantee
and/or a certificate delivered pursuant to the Merger Agreement, confidentiality, termination fees provisions and miscellaneous
provisions, will survive any such termination and remain in full force and effect. Subject to each party’s acknowledgement of
absence of other representations and warranties made by the other parties other than those set forth in the Merger Agreement, the
Limited Guarantee and/or a certificate delivered pursuant to the Merger Agreement and the termination fees payable by the
Company or Parent described in the sections captioned “The Merger Agreement — Company Termination Fee” and “The Merger
Agreement — Reverse Termination Fee and Other Remedies,” the termination of the Merger Agreement will not relieve any party

on or before the Outside Date), (ii) by the Company or Parent if the Requisite Stockholder Approval has not been obtained
at a stockholders’ meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, or (iii) by Parent if the Company’s failure to

Company’s performance of obligations, agreements or covenants not being satisfied, and such failure is not curable prior to

written notice thereof by Parent to the Company;

• prior to the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, a Competing Proposal has been publicly
disclosed; and

• within 12 months after the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Company has entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Competing Proposal and any Competing Proposal is subsequently consummated; provided that each
reference to 20% in the definition of “Competing Proposal” will be deemed to be a reference to “50%.”

Reverse Termination Fee and Other Remedies

Parent has agreed to pay the Company the Reverse Termination Fee if the Merger Agreement is terminated as described below:

• by the Company if (i) all conditions to Parent’s and Sub’s obligations to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions, by their nature, are to be satisfied by actions taken at the closing, and each of which is capable
of being satisfied at the closing and is reasonably expected to be satisfied as of the closing), (ii) Parent and Sub fail to
consummate the Merger on the closing date as required by the Merger Agreement, (iii) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed by written notice to Parent that (A) all conditions to the Company’s obligations to effect the Merger have been
satisfied or irrevocably waived (other than those conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied by actions taken at the
closing) and (B) the Company stands ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger (and it has not delivered written
notice purporting to revoke such notice), and (iv) Parent and Sub fail to consummate the Merger on the third business day
following delivery of such written notice; or

• by the Company or Parent if the closing has not occurred on or before the Outside Date (but only if the terminating party
has not materially breached any representation, warranty or covenant, which has caused the failure of the closing to occur
on or before the Outside Date) at a time when the Company had the right to terminate the Merger Agreement under the
circumstance described in the immediately preceding bullet point.

Furthermore, Parent has agreed that the Company has the right to seek damages following a termination of the Merger
Agreement by the Company in the instance where Parent or Sub has internationally breached its covenants specified in Article V of
the Merger Agreement and such breach is not curable prior to the Outside Date or has not been cured within 30 days after delivery
of notice by the Company to Parent; provided, however, that under no circumstance will the Company or any of its affiliates be
entitled to receive damages for such alleged intentional breach in excess of $15 million.

In addition, prior to the termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company, the Company will be entitled to obtain specific
performance to cause Parent and Sub to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger only if: (i) all
conditions to Parent’s and Sub’s obligations to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions, by their
nature, are to be satisfied by actions taken at the closing, and each of which is capable of being satisfied at the closing and is
reasonably expected to be satisfied as of the closing), (ii) the BAML Debt Commitment comprised in the Debt Financing has been
funded or will be funded at the closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the closing, (iii) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in a written notice to Parent (and has not purported to revoke such notice) that (A) all conditions to Parent’s and Sub’s
obligations to effect the Merger have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied
by actions taken at the closing), and (B) if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and BAML Debt Commitment
are funded, the Company stands ready, willing and able to consummate the closing. If a court of competent jurisdiction has
declined to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger
under the above circumstance and has instead granted an award of damages for such alleged breach of Parent’s obligation to cause
the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger, the Company may enforce such award and accept damages for
such alleged breach only if, within ten business

days following such determination (i) the Company confirms to the Parent in writing that the Company stands ready, willing and
able to consummate the closing (whether or not this Agreement has previously been terminated), and (ii) Parent does not
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within ten business days of such written confirmation; provided,
however, that under no circumstances will the Company or any of its affiliates be entitled to enforce such an award or accept
damages for such alleged breach in excess of $25 million.

While the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement and the
payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or damages as described above relating to any intentional breach, under no circumstances
will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both such grant of specific performance (or damages contemplated pursuant to
the immediately preceding paragraph) and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or damages relating to any intentional
breach.

Amendment and Waiver

The Merger Agreement provides that subject to the other provisions of the Merger Agreement, the Merger Agreement may be
amended by the parties thereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Company,
Parent and Sub. However, in the event that the Merger Agreement has been adopted by the Company stockholders, no amendment
will be made to the Merger Agreement that requires the approval of such stockholders under applicable law or rules of any relevant
stock exchange without such approval; provided, however, that no amendment, modification, waiver or termination may be made to
certain sections of the Merger Agreement in a manner adverse to the interests of any debt financing sources related party without
the written consent of such debt financing sources.

The parties may at any time prior to the Effective Time (such action to be set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such party), (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties; (ii) waive any breaches of or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties or (iii) waive
compliance with any of the covenants or conditions of the other parties; provided, that after the approval of the Company
stockholders has been obtained, no waiver may be made that, if obtained, would decrease the Merger Consideration or adversely
affect the rights of the stockholders, without approval of the Company stockholders.

Governing Law

The Merger Agreement is governed by Delaware law, without regard to the laws of any other jurisdiction that might be applied
because of the conflicts of laws principles of the State of Delaware.

Specific Performance

Parent, Sub and the Company have agreed that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of the Merger Agreement is
not performed, or is threatened to be not performed, in accordance with its specific terms or is otherwise breached. Subject to
certain provisions of the Merger Agreement, the parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the Merger Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity, and (ii) no party will require the other to post any bond or other security as a condition to institute any
proceeding for specific performance under the Merger Agreement.

Subject to limited exceptions (including the receipt of Reverse Termination Fee or damages described in the section captioned
“The Merger Agreement — Reverse Termination Fee and Other Remedies”), the Company has agreed that, prior to the closing of
the Merger, specific performance will be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to breaches by Parent or Sub in connection
with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) and
that it may not seek or accept any other form of relief that may be available for breach under the Merger Agreement or otherwise in
connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including monetary damages).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock, as of August
4, 2017, of each person or entity who we know to beneficially own 5% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock and
all of our current directors and executive officers as a group.

Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. In computing the number of shares beneficially
owned by a person, and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of our common stock subject to stock options held by that
person that are currently exercisable, or exercisable within 60 days of August 4, 2017, are deemed outstanding. Such shares,
however, are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Unless otherwise
indicated below, the address of each beneficial owner listed in the table is c/o West Marine, Inc., 500 Westridge Drive, Watsonville,
California 95076-4100.

The percentages in the table below are based on 25,274,566 shares of our common stock outstanding as of August 4, 2017.
Except as indicated in the footnotes to this table and pursuant to applicable community property laws, to our knowledge, each
stockholder named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares set forth opposite such
stockholder’s name. The information provided in this table is based on our records and information filed with the SEC, unless
otherwise noted.

If the Merger is consummated, we will have no public stockholders and there will be no public participation in any future

attend and participate in stockholder meetings.

The Company will hold an annual meeting in 2018 only if the Merger has not already been consummated.

Proposals of stockholders that are intended for inclusion in our proxy statement relating to our annual meeting in 2018, if held,
must be received by us at our offices at 500 Westridge Drive, Watsonville, California 95076-4100, Attention: Corporate Secretary,
no later than December 22, 2017, and must satisfy the conditions established by the SEC, including, but not limited to, Rule 14a-8
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and in our bylaws for stockholder proposals in order to be included in our proxy statement
for that meeting.

Stockholders may only present a matter for consideration at our annual meeting in 2018, if held, if certain procedures are
followed. Under our bylaws, in order for a matter to be deemed properly presented by a stockholder, timely notice must be received
by the secretary of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the 90th

day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting. To
be timely for the 2018 annual meeting, a stockholder’s notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by the Corporate
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company between February 1, 2018 and March 3, 2018.

Nominations for the election of directors at an annual meeting may be made only (i) by or at the direction of the Board, or (ii)

notice and as of the record date for that meeting. The notice must contain specified information about the nominees and about the
stockholder proposing such nominations. To be timely for the next annual meeting, a stockholder’s notice must be delivered to or

Section 1.02 Closing.  The closing of the Merger (the “Closing”) will take place (a) at 9:00 a.m. New York City time on the
date that is two (2) Business Days following the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions
set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the

Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other later date and time as is agreed
between the parties and specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time, the “Effective Time”).

Section 1.04 Organizational Documents, Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

(a) Organizational Documents.  At the Effective Time, (i) the Company Charter, as in effect immediately prior to the

shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the Company By-laws shall be amended and
restated in their entirety to read as the bylaws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended
and restated, shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation (except that references to the name of Sub shall be replaced by
references to the name of the Surviving Corporation), in each case until, subject to Section 5.07, thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable Law and the applicable provisions of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) Directors.  Subject to applicable Law, the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation effective as of, and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARTICLE II
EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 2.01 Conversion of Securities.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company or the
holders of any capital stock of the Company or Sub:

(i) Conversion of Company Common Stock.  Each share of Company Common Stock (each, a “Share” and collectively,
the “Shares”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than the Cancelled Shares and the
Dissenting Shares, shall automatically be converted into the right to receive $12.97 in cash, without interest (the “Merger
Consideration”), and all of such Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall cease to exist, and each certificate representing a
Share (a “Certificate”) or non-certificated Share represented by book-entry (“Book-Entry Shares”) that formerly represented
any of the Shares (other than the Cancelled Shares and the Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter be cancelled and cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest thereon, subject to
Section 2.05.

(ii) Cancellation of Company-Owned Shares and Parent-Owned Shares.  All Shares that are held in the treasury of the
Company or owned of record by any wholly-owned Company Subsidiary and all Shares owned of record by Parent or any
of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries (such Shares, the “Cancelled Shares”) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no
payment being made with respect thereto.

(iii) Capital Stock of Sub.  Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Sub shall be automatically converted
into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) Merger Consideration Adjustment.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the number of outstanding Shares shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon
shall be declared with a record date within said period, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the
holders of Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

Section 2.02 Exchange of Certificates; Payment for Shares.

(a) Paying Agent.  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a U.S.-based nationally recognized financial institution
reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent (the “Paying Agent”) for the holders of Shares to receive the funds to
which such holders shall become entitled pursuant to this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Paying Agent, in immediately available funds, a cash amount equal to the sum of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration
(the “Exchange Fund”). The Exchange Fund shall be for the benefit of the holders of Shares that are entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration. For purposes of determining the aggregate amount to be so deposited, Parent shall assume that no
stockholder of the Company shall perfect any right to appraisal of such stockholder or its Shares. In the event the Exchange
Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.01(a)(i) and this Section 2.02, Parent shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount sufficient to make such payments. Funds
made available to the Paying Agent may be invested by the Paying Agent, as directed by Parent, but only in short-term
obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States of America with
maturities of no more than 30 days or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of Shares pursuant to
Section 2.01(a)(i) and Section 2.02; provided, that no investment of such deposited funds shall relieve Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent from promptly making the payments required by Section 2.01(a)(i) and this Section 2.02, and
following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall

TABLE OF CONTENTS

promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, in the amount of such losses,
which additional funds will be held and disbursed in the same manner as funds initially deposited with the Paying Agent to
make the payments contemplated by Section 2.01(a)(i) and Section 2.02. Any interest or income produced by such investments
will be payable to Sub or Parent, as Parent directs. Parent shall direct the Paying Agent to hold the Exchange Fund for the
benefit of the former holders of Shares and to make payments from the Exchange Fund in accordance with Section 2.01(a)(i)
and Section 2.02. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to Section 2.01(a)
(i) or Section 2.02, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) Procedures for Surrender.  As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than the second
Business Day following the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a
letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.02(e) to the Paying Agent)
and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify after consultation with the
Company and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.02(e)) for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to
such Certificate, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the portion of the Aggregate
Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate were converted pursuant to
Section 2.01 (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.05), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made and the Merger Consideration may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for
transfer, and the person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered
or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to
be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the person in whose
name such Book-Entry Shares are registered and shall be made promptly following the Effective Time without any action on
the part of the person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion
of the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with
Section 2.02(e)) or Book-Entry Share.

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares.  As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the
Company. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon surrender of any Shares shall
represent full payment and satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as
otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability.  At any time following the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect thereto) not disbursed to holders of Shares, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Shares and compliance with the procedures
set forth in Section 2.02(b), without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for Merger Consideration properly delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent) of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the portion of the Aggregate Common Stock Consideration into which the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate were converted pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i); provided, however, that the Paying Agent may, in
its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide a bond in a customary amount.

Section 2.03 Treatment of Company Options, RSUs and Equity Plans.

(a) Treatment of Company Options.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company’s board of directors (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding option to purchase Shares granted under the Company Equity Incentive Plan (the “Company Options”) shall be
fully vested and cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to
receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an
amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such cancelled Company Option and (ii) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per Share subject to such cancelled Company Option, without
interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the “Option Payments”); provided, however, that (i) any such Company Option with
respect to which the exercise price per Share subject thereto is greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled in
exchange for no consideration and (ii) such Option Payments may be reduced by the amount of any required Tax withholdings
as provided in Section 2.05. From and after the Effective Time, no Company Option shall be exercisable, and each Company
Option shall only entitle the holder thereof to the payment provided for in this Section 2.03(a).

(b) Treatment of Employee Restricted Stock Units.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company’s board of directors (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each then outstanding unvested award of time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units (each,
an “RSU”) with respect to Shares (each, an “RSU Award”) granted pursuant to the Company Equity Incentive Plan, other than
any RSU Award held by a non-employee director of the Company, shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation and shall be
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the Merger Consideration, multiplied by (ii)
the number of RSUs subject to such RSU Award (the “Cash Replacement Company RSU Awards”), which Cash Replacement
Company RSU Awards will, subject to the holder’s continued employment with the Surviving Corporation through the
applicable vesting dates, vest and be payable at the same time as the RSU Awards for which such Cash Replacement RSU
Awards were exchanged would have vested pursuant to their terms. All Cash Replacement Company RSU Awards will have the
same terms and conditions (including, with respect to vesting (including accelerated vesting on specific terminations of
employment, to the extent applicable)) and settlement as applied to the RSU Awards for which they were exchanged, except for
terms rendered inoperative by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or for such other administrative or
ministerial changes that are not materially detrimental to the holders and that in the reasonable and good faith determination of
Parent are necessary for the administration of the Cash Replacement Company RSU Awards; provided, however, that no such
change shall cause the Cash Replacement Company RSU Awards to violate Code Section 409A. To the extent an RSU Award is
subject to performance conditions, the number of RSUs that are assumed by the Surviving Corporation and are converted into
Cash Replacement Company RSU Awards shall be determined (A) for RSU Awards with a performance period that by its terms
has ended prior to the Effective Time, based on actual performance

TABLE OF CONTENTS

through the end of such performance period, and (B) for RSU Awards with a performance period that by its terms has not ended
prior to the Effective Time, assuming performance of 100% of target levels.

(c) Treatment of Director Restricted Stock Units.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company’s board of directors (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each outstanding unvested RSU Award granted pursuant to the Company Equity Incentive Plan and held by a non-employee
director of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be fully vested and cancelled and, in exchange therefor,
each holder of any such cancelled RSU Award shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such RSU
Award and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration
multiplied by (ii) the number of RSUs subject to such RSU Award, without interest (such amounts payable hereunder, the “RSU
Payments”) (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.05).

(d) Termination of Company Equity Incentive Plan and Company Stock Purchase Plan.

(i) As of the Effective Time, the Company Equity Incentive Plan and the Company Stock Purchase Plan shall terminate,
and no further Company Options, RSUs or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder.

(ii) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, but prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all action that may be necessary to: (A) cause any outstanding offering period under the Company Stock Purchase Plan to be
terminated prior to the Effective Time; (B) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the shortened
offering period, but otherwise treat such shortened offering period as a fully effective and completed offering period for all
purposes under the Company Stock Purchase Plan; (C) provide that all outstanding options granted under the Company
Stock Purchase Plan (the “SPP Options”) shall be cancelled as of the Closing Date (if not terminated earlier pursuant to the
terms of the Company Stock Purchase Plan), provided that each holder of an SPP Option may exercise (consistent with the
Company Stock Purchase Plan and prior to the Effective Time) each outstanding purchase right under the Company Stock
Purchase Plan; (D) provide that no further offering period or purchase period shall commence under the Company Stock
Purchase Plan after the date of this Agreement; and (E) ensure that no individual shall be permitted to make a new election
to purchase shares in any current offering period or increase his or her election to purchase shares in any current offering
period; provided, however, that the actions described in clauses “(A)” through “(E)” of this sentence shall be conditioned
upon the consummation of the Merger. On such new exercise date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such
date under the Company Stock Purchase Plan within each participant’s payroll withholding account to the purchase of
whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Company Stock Purchase Plan.

(e) Parent Funding.  At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Surviving Corporation cash in the amount
necessary to make the payments required under this Section 2.03. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to make the
payments required under this Section 2.03 within three Business Days after the Effective Time. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay through the Payroll Agent the applicable Option Payments and RSU Payments, if any, to the holders of
Company Options and RSUs, in each case, subject to Section 2.05.

Section 2.04 Dissenting Shares.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding
Shares held by a person (a “Dissenting Stockholder”) who is entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and has
complied with all the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of Shares to require appraisal of such Shares
(“Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as described in Section 2.01(a)(i),
but shall become the right to receive the fair value of such Shares pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL.
If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws such Dissenting Stockholder’s demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses
such Dissenting Stockholder’s right of appraisal with respect to such Shares, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, such Shares shall
be deemed to be converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each such Share, without
interest and subject to Section 2.05. The

Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of Shares received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served on the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not, without
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

Section 2.05 Withholding Rights.  Each of Parent, Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of the Shares, Company
Options and RSU Awards vested or cancelled in the Merger, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment, or the vesting, waiver of restrictions or other actions provided for in this Agreement, under the Code
or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation,
Sub, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted by the Surviving Corporation,
Sub, Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options or RSU Awards in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, Sub, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of (i) an executed
equity commitment agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the “Equity Commitment Agreement”), among Parent, Sub and
Guarantor, pursuant to which Guarantor has agreed, according to the terms and subject to the conditions therein, to fund an
amount sufficient to satisfy the Financing Uses no later than immediately prior to the Closing (the “Equity Financing”), (ii) the
Limited Guarantee and (iii) the Debt Financing Commitment Letters (the Equity Commitment Agreement and the Debt
Financing Commitment Letters, collectively, the “Financing Letters”) (and corresponding fee letters relating to the Debt
Financing Commitment Letters redacted only in respect of specific fee amounts and specific “flex” terms, none of which affect
the conditionality, availability or amount of the Debt Financing available on the Closing Date or remedies available with respect
thereto) from the Debt Financing Sources, pursuant to which the Debt Financing Sources have agreed to provide, severally and
not jointly, subject to the terms and conditions therein, the Debt Financing (such Debt Financing, together with the Equity
Financing, collectively referred to as the “Financings”). The Company is an express third-party beneficiary with respect to, and
is entitled to specifically enforce, the Equity Commitment Agreement.

(b) On the Closing Date, assuming receipt of the proceeds of the Financings in accordance with the terms of the Financing
Letters, Parent will have sufficient available funds to pay the Aggregate Merger Consideration and any other cash amounts
payable pursuant to, or in connection with the Transaction, including any obligations of the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries that become due or payable by the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries in connection with, or as
a result of, the Transactions, and payment of all fees and expenses related to the foregoing (collectively, the “Financing Uses ”).

(c) The Financing Letters and Limited Guarantee have not been terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented or
modified in any respect as of the date of this Agreement. The Equity Commitment Agreement and the Limited Guarantee are
legal, valid and binding obligations of each of the parties thereto (other than the Company), enforceable against such parties in
accordance with their terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. The Debt Financing Commitment Letters

provide the Debt Financing, enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or other

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Contracts or arrangements relating to the Financings other than as expressly contained in the Financing Letters and delivered to
the Company prior to the date hereof, in each case, that would affect the availabiltiy of the Debt Financing or make the Debt
Financing materially less likely to occur. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, could constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent, Sub or Guarantor under any term of, or a failure
of any condition under, the Financing Letters or otherwise result in any portion of the Financings contemplated thereby to be
unavailable on the Closing Date. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies to the availability of the Financings,
other than the conditions set forth in this Agreement (with respect to the Equity Financing) and those explicitly set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitment Letters (the “Financing Conditions”) with respect to the Debt Financing. No event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent or, to the
knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under the Financing Letters or the Limited Guarantee or would result in the failure
of a Financing Condition. Each of Parent and Sub has no reason to believe that it or any other party to the Financing Letters will
be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term thereof. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financings other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Letters.

(d) Neither Parent nor Sub has, directly or indirectly, entered into an exclusivity, lock-up or other similar agreement,
arrangement or binding understanding with any bank or investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity financing
that prohibits such provider from providing or seeking to provide services, including debt or equity financing, to any third
person in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries (including in connection with the
making of any Competing Proposal) in connection with the Transactions.

Section 4.08 Guarantee.  Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent and Sub have caused the Guarantor to
deliver the Limited Guarantee, dated as of the date hereof, to the Company. The Limited Guarantee is in full force and effect and
has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect. The Limited Guarantee is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could constitute a
default or breach on the part of the Guarantor under such Limited Guarantee.

Section 4.09 Brokers.  No broker, finder or investment banker other than Jefferies LLC is entitled to any brokerage, finder’s or
other fee or commission in connection with the Transactions based on arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent, Sub or any of
their respective affiliates.

Section 4.10 Solvency.  Assuming that (a) the conditions to the obligation of Parent and Sub to consummate the Merger have
been satisfied or waived, (b) any estimates, projections or forecasts prepared by the Company or the Company Representatives that
have been provided to Parent, Sub or their representatives have been prepared in good faith based upon reasonable assumptions as
of the date of preparation thereof, (c) the most recent financial statements included in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or an
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by the Company with the SEC present fairly in all material respects that consolidated financial
condition of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries at the end of the periods covered thereby and the consolidated results of
operations of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered there, and (d) the representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in Article III are accurate, then and immediately following the Effective Time and after giving
effect to all of the Transactions, any alternative financing incurred in accordance with Section 5.08(a) and the payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration, any other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing
Letters and the payment of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation will be solvent. Parent and Sub are not entering into the Transactions with the intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors.

thereof (the “Company Board”) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that
such Competing Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under Law, then the Company
may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the person making such Competing
Proposal and its representatives and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Competing
Proposal and its representatives regarding such Competing Proposal; provided, however, that the Company (w) will not, will
not permit the Company Subsidiaries to, and will not authorize the Company Representatives to, disclose any non-public
information regarding the Company to such person without first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with
such person; (x) will promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) advise Parent in writing of the receipt of any Competing
Proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and shall disclose to Parent the
material terms of any such Competing Proposal (but shall have no obligation to disclose to Parent the identity of any person
making such Competing Proposal or the terms thereof) (such notice, including the material terms of such Competing Proposal,
a “Competing Proposal Notice”), (y) will keep Parent informed in all material respects on a prompt basis of any material
developments, discussions or negotiations regarding such Competing Proposal, including by updating the Competing Proposal
Notice to reflect any updated terms of the Competing Proposal, and (z) will as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
24 hours thereafter) provide to Parent any information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries provided or made
available to such other person (or its representatives) that was not previously provided or made available to Parent. So long as
the Company and the Company Representatives have otherwise complied with this Section 5.03, none of the foregoing shall
prohibit the Company or the Company Representatives from contacting any person or group of persons that has made a
Competing Proposal after the date of this Agreement solely to request the clarification of the terms and conditions thereof so as
to determine whether the Competing Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and
any such actions shall not be a breach of this Section 5.03.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 5.03(d) or Section 5.03(e), neither the Company’s board of directors nor any committee
thereof shall (i) adopt, authorize, approve, endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any Competing
Proposal, (ii) following the public announcement of a Competing Proposal, at the written request of Parent, fail to reaffirm
publicly the Company Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days after Parent’s written request to do so (provided,
however, that Parent shall be entitled to make such written request for reaffirmation only once as to each Competing Proposal
unless the price contemplated by such Competing Proposal is increased), (iii) following the commencement of a tender offer or
exchange relating to the Shares by a person unaffiliated with Parent, fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation and
recommend that the Company’s stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within ten (10) Business Days after the
commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer, or (iv) withhold, change, modify, amend or otherwise propose publicly
to withdraw, change, modify, amend, in each case, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or fail to
include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), a
“Change of Company Recommendation”) or (v) allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement relating to any Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring the Company
to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Transactions.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make a Change of Company Recommendation if:

(i) (A) a Competing Proposal (that did not result from a material breach of Section 5.03(a)) is made to the Company
after the date hereof by a third person and such Competing Proposal is not withdrawn and (B) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;

(ii) the Company provides Parent prior written notice of the Company’s intention to make a Change of Company
Recommendation (a “Notice of Change of Recommendation”) no less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Company
Board making a Change of Company Recommendation, which notice shall identify the person making such Superior
Proposal and include the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (it being agreed that neither the delivery
of the Notice of Change of Recommendation by the Company nor the public announcement that the Company Board has
received or is evaluating a Competing Proposal, in and of itself, shall constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

(iii) the Company has (to the extent requested by Parent) negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent during such three (3) Business Days prior to making such
Change of Company Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Change of Recommendation and an additional two-day period from the date
of such notice); and

(iv) taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent in writing to the Company, the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
such Competing Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal even if such changes offered in writing by
Parent were to be given effect.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board may make a Change of Company Recommendation if:

(i) there shall occur or arise after the date of this Agreement a material development or material change in circumstances
(or if such material development or material change in circumstances occurred or arose on or prior to the date of this
Agreement, the material consequences of which are not known to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement and
only become known to the Company Board prior to the Effective Time), in each case, that was not reasonably foreseeable
and that relates to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries but does not relate to any Competing Proposal (as to which
Section 5.03(d) shall apply) (any such material development or material change in circumstances unrelated to an Competing
Proposal being referred to as an “Intervening Event”);

(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation in a manner
adverse to Parent would, if this Agreement were not amended or an alternative transaction with Parent were not entered
into, be inconsistent with the Company Board’s fiduciary obligations to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Law;

(iii) the Company provides Parent a Notice of Change of Recommendation, which notice shall describe the Intervening
Event (it being agreed that neither the delivery of the Notice of Change of Recommendation by the Company nor the public
announcement that the Company Board is considering making a Change of Company Recommendation under applicable
Law shall constitute a Change of Company Recommendation);

(iv) the Company has (to the extent requested by Parent) negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent for at least three Business Days following receipt by Parent of
such Notice of Change of Recommendation; and

(v) taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent in writing to the Company, the
Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
the failure to withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company Board’s
fiduciary obligations to the Company’s stockholders under applicable Law in light of such Intervening Event.

to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) issuing a “stop, look and listen” statement pending disclosure of its position, as
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that a position disclosed

any applicable Competing Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation and provided further that the
Company or the Company Board may not effect a Change of Recommendation except as permitted by Section 5.03(d) or (e).

Section 5.04 Access to Information.  From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause
each Company Subsidiary to: (a) provide to Parent and Sub and their respective representatives reasonable access during normal
business hours in such a manner as not to interfere with the operation of any business conducted by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, upon prior written notice to the Company, to the officers, employees, properties, offices and other facilities of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof; and (b) furnish promptly such information
concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and Company Subsidiaries as Parent or its
representatives may reasonably request; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to (or to cause any Company
Subsidiary to) afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that the Company believes in good faith after
consultation with legal counsel that doing so would: (i) result in the loss of attorney-client privilege (provided that the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client
privilege); (ii) violate any confidentiality obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any third person or otherwise
breach, contravene or violate any then effective Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is party (provided that
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to share such information with
Parent); (iii) result in a competitor of the Company or any Company Subsidiary receiving information that is competitively
sensitive; or (iv) breach, contravene or violate any applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law). Parent
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives, to hold all information provided or
furnished pursuant to this Section 5.04 confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. During any visit
to the business or property sites of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, each of Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause
their respective representatives accessing such properties to, comply with all applicable Laws and all of the Company’s and the
Company Subsidiaries’ safety and security procedures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.04,
from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, none of Parent, Sub or any of their respective affiliates shall conduct,
without the prior written consent of the Company, any invasive subsurface environmental site investigation at any real property
owned or leased by the Company, and in no event may any such invasive subsurface environmental site investigation include any
sampling or other intrusive investigation of air, surface water, groundwater, soil or anything else at or in connection with any of
such real property.

and every impediment to the consummation of the Transactions and obtain all approvals and consents under any Antitrust Laws
that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Entity, in each case with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to consummate the Transactions as promptly as practicable. Neither Parent nor Sub,
directly or indirectly, through one or more of their respective affiliated investment funds, shall take any action, including
acquiring or making any investment in any person or any division or assets thereof, that would reasonably be expected to cause
a material delay in the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Article VI or the consummation of the Transactions.

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 5.05, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other
parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding by or before
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such
request, inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from
the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions. Each party hereto will consult
and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith the views of the other parties in connection with any filing,
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Transactions. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any
Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding, each party hereto will permit authorized
representatives of the other parties to be present at each meeting or conference relating to such request, inquiry, investigation or
legal Proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request, inquiry, investigation or legal Proceeding.

Section 5.06 Public Announcements.  The initial press release issued by Parent and the Company concerning this Agreement
and the Transactions shall be a joint press release, and thereafter, except with respect to any Change of Company Recommendation,
Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to the Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, fiduciary duties or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange.

Section 5.07 Directors & Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

(a) Indemnification.  From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to the extent provided in the organizational documents of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current or former director or
officer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (each an “Indemnified Party” and collectively, the “Indemnified
Parties”) against (i) all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), judgments, fines, claims, damages
or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next succeeding sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) to
the extent that they are based on or arise

out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the “Indemnified
Liabilities”), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are based on or arise out of or pertain to the Transactions,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and including any expenses incurred in enforcing such
person’s rights under this Section 5.07. In the event of any such loss, expense, claim, damage or liability (whether or not
asserted before the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected
by the Indemnified Parties promptly after statements therefor are received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party
upon request, reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred (provided that the person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advance if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction that such person is not legally entitled to indemnification under Law).

(b) Insurance.  The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Effective Time, and if the Company fails to do so, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium for an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the Effective Time
(the “D&O Insurance”) that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate to the intended
beneficiaries thereof than the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy. If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such “tail” insurance policy as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six-year period
thereunder are being adjudicated) the D&O Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of this
Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable D&O
Insurance for such six-year period (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought before the end of such six-year period
thereunder are being adjudicated) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as
provided in the Company’s existing policies as of the date of this Agreement.

(c) Successors.  In the event the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in either such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors, assigns or transferees of the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.07.

(d) Continuation.  For not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws
of the Surviving Corporation and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or other similar documents) of each Company
Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
for periods at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Charter, the Company By-Laws or the
equivalent organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary. The contractual indemnification rights set forth in the
indemnification agreements, the form of which is filed as an exhibit to the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2016, with any of the directors, officers or employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, without any further action, and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

(e) Benefit.  The provisions of this Section 5.07 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, each Indemnified Party’s heirs, executors or administrators and each Indemnified Party’s representatives,
shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation and shall not be amended
in a manner that is adverse to any Indemnified Parties (including their successors, assigns and heirs) without the consent of the
Indemnified Party (including the successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby.

(f) Non-Exclusivity.  The provisions of this Section 5.07 are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement, including
this Section 5.07, is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors’ and officers’
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries or the Indemnified Parties, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section
5.07 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

Section 5.08 Financing

(a) Financing.

(i) Parent and Sub shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any provision under
the Equity Commitment Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company. Parent and Sub acknowledge and

conditioned on, receipt of the Equity Financing or any other financing.

(ii) Each of Parent and Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or

the Debt Financing Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive financing agreements with respect to the
Debt Financing that are on terms and conditions (including the market “flex” provisions) no less favorable to Parent and
Sub than those contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters, or, if available, on other terms that are acceptable to
Parent and would not (A) reasonably be expected to adversely affect Parent’s or Sub’s ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to fund the amounts
required to be paid by Parent and Sub under this Agreement below the amount required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (C) impose new or additional conditions or expand upon (or amend or modify in any
manner adverse to the interests of the Company) the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment Letters, (D) reasonably be expected to delay the Closing or (E) amend any remedies available in
respect of the Debt Financing, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Sub contained in the
Debt Financing Commitment Letters (other than any condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of the
Company’s failure to provide the cooperation described in Section 5.08(c)), including the payment of any commitment,
engagement, or placement fees required as a condition to the Debt Financing, (iv) consummate or cause to be consummated
the Debt Financing at or prior to the date that the Closing is required to be effected in accordance with Section 1.02 (Parent
and Sub acknowledge and agree that it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement, nor to the consummation of the
Merger, for Parent and Sub to obtain the Debt Financing or any alternative financing), and (v) comply with its obligations
under the Financing Letters. Subject to the terms and upon satisfaction of the Financing Conditions, Parent and Sub shall
use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Debt Financing Sources to provide the Debt Financing on the Closing Date.
Parent shall make available to the Company copies of all documents relating to the Debt Financing upon the Company’s
reasonable request (subject to the confidentiality provisions therein) and shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a
current basis and in reasonable detail of material developments in respect of the financing process relating thereto upon the
Company’s reasonable request. The documents relating to the Debt Financing will not contain any conditions to the
availability of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date other than the Financing Conditions.

(iii) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, agree to, or permit, any
amendment or modification of, or waiver or consent under, the any Commitment Letter or other documentation relating to
the Financings which would (i) reasonably be expected to adversely affect Parent or Sub’s ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing to fund the amounts
required to

(x) supplement the written information (other than information of a general economic or industry-specific nature)
concerning the Company, its Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated hereby to the extent that any such information
contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make such information, taken as a
whole, not misleading in any material respect promptly after gaining knowledge thereof.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.08(a)(i), (i) nothing in this Agreement shall require any
cooperation or other action to the extent it would materially interfere with the business or operations of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries; (ii) neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to commit to take
any action that is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any agreement or instrument) or that would be

any of the Company Subsdiaries shall not be required to approve any financing or agreements related thereto (or any alternative

liability or obligation or provide or agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Financings or any action taken in
accordance with Section 5.08(a)(i) at or prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the

any action taken in accordance with Section 5.08(a)(i)) and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
historical information provided by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the condition set forth in Section 6.02(b), as it applies to the Company’s obligations under this
Section 5.08, shall be deemed satisfied regardless of any breach by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries of their
obligations under this Section 5.08 unless the Company has materially breached this Section 5.08 and the result of such breach
is that Parent is unable to obtain the Debt Financing. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the

in connection with this Section 5.08.

immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) an annual bonus opportunity to each Company Employee that is substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the annual cash-based bonus opportunity provided to such Company Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (iii) severance benefits to each Company Employee that are substantially comparable in the

that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other compensation and benefits provided to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Company Benefit Plans.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.10(a), from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and continue all of the Company’s and the Company
Subsidiaries’ employment, severance, retention and termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements
(provided that any change in control, severance, retention and termination plans, policies and agreements between the Company
or any Company Subsidiary and any Company Employee are set forth in Section 5.10(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter), in
each case, in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, including with respect to any
payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or in combination with any other event) and, for
the duration of the Benefit Protection Period shall do so without any amendment or modification, other than any amendment or
modification required to comply with applicable Law or as permitted pursuant to the terms of the applicable plans, policies,
programs, agreements and arrangements.

level of benefits (under any “employee benefit plan” (as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, but without regard to
whether the applicable plan is subject to ERISA) and any other employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, (other than any equity based
compensation plan, long-term incentive plan, defined benefit pension plan or retiree health or welfare plan) each Company
Employee’s service with or otherwise credited by the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be treated as service with
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation to the same extent such service was recognized under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to use commercially reasonable efforts
to waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively at work requirements and waiting
periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, in
which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time,
except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the
dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her
eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year’s
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Company Employee (and
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) be treated as the establishment of or an
amendment of any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, (ii) give any employee
or former employee or any other individual associated therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other
third person any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 5.10 or (iii) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their affiliates to (A) maintain any particular benefit plan, except in accordance with the terms of such plan, or (B) retain the
employment of any particular employee for any duration.

Article II. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid when due by Parent, Sub or, after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation.

Section 5.12 Rule 16b-3 Matters.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company shall be
permitted to take such actions as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of the
Company (including derivative securities) by any officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange
Act pursuant to the Transactions are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.13 Securityholder Litigation.  The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any litigation commenced after the date
of this Agreement against the Company or any of its directors by any Company stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of
the Company) to the extent relating to this Agreement or the Transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and shall
keep Parent reasonably and regularly informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall not settle any such litigation
without the prior written consent of Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

Section 5.14 Preparation of the Proxy Statement: Stockholders’ Meeting.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than July 21, 2017 (as
long as Parent has complied with its obligation to cooperate with the Company set forth in this Section 5.14(a)), the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, and Parent shall cooperate with the Company with the preparation of
the foregoing. The Company, with Parent’s cooperation, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to and resolve all comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy Statement. The
Company will cause the Proxy Statement in definitive form to be mailed to the Company’s stockholders, in each case as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement. No filing of,
or amendment or supplement to, or correspondence with the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement will be made by the
Company without providing Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not apply with respect to an Competing Proposal, a Superior Proposal, a Change of Company Recommendation
or any matters relating thereto. Each of Parent and Sub shall cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation
and filing of the Proxy Statement, including promptly furnishing to the Company in writing upon request any and all
information relating to it as may be required to be set forth in the Proxy Statement under applicable Law. Parent agrees that
such information supplied by it in writing for inclusion (or incorporation by reference) in the Proxy Statement will not, on the
date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Stockholders’ Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or its Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, Parent shall promptly notify the Company so that it may file with
the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information and, to the extent required by Law, disseminate
such amendment or supplement to the stockholders of the Company. The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will not, on
the date it is first mailed to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, at any time prior to the

not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company shall promptly notify Parent and

Proxy Statement, in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter and NASDAQ rules, duly give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders to consider the adoption of this Agreement (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the “Stockholders’ Meeting”); provided, however, that the Company shall be permitted to delay or postpone convening
the Stockholders’ Meeting (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable additional
time for any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated

(e) Each of the Company, Parent and Sub acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 7.02 are an integral
part of the Transactions and (ii) without these agreements, Parent, Sub and the Company would not enter into this Agreement.
In no event shall the Company be required to pay to Parent more than one Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section
7.02(b). In the event that Parent receives full payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section 7.02(b) under
circumstances where a Company Termination Fee was payable, the receipt of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole
and exclusive monetary remedy for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Sub, any of their respective
affiliates or any other person in connection with this Agreement (and the termination of this Agreement), the Merger and the
Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination.

Section 7.03 Amendment.  Subject to Section 5.07(e), this Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent and Sub by
action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that,
after the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made which, by Law or in accordance with the rules
of any relevant stock exchange, requires approval by the holders of Shares without obtaining such approval. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 5.08, 7.02,
7.03, 8.06, 8.08 and 8.10 of this Agreement (and any other provision of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or
termination of such provision would modify the substance of the foregoing as it applies to any Debt Financing Source Related
Party) and the definitions related thereto (solely as used in such sections) (collectively, the “Lender Designated Sections”) may not
be amended in a manner adverse to the interests of any Debt Financing Sources Related Party without the written consent of Debt
Financing Sources.

Section 7.04 Waiver.  At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive any breach or
inaccuracy of the representations and warranties of the other contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other with any of the covenants or conditions contained in this Agreement; provided,
however, that after the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, there may not be any extension or waiver of this Agreement
that decreases the Merger Consideration or that adversely affects the rights of the holders of Shares hereunder without the approval
of the holders of Shares at a duly convened meeting of the holders of Shares called to obtain approval of such extension or waiver.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

ARTICLE VIII
GENERAL PROVISIONS

Section 8.01 Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties.  None of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time. Except for any covenant or
agreement that by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time, which shall survive until such covenant is
performed in accordance with their terms, none of the covenants and agreements of the parties contained this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time.

payment thereunder and (c) Section 5.07, which shall be for the benefit of each Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party’s heirs,

respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other parties, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any
person other than the parties any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties

are the product of negotiations among the parties and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations
and warranties may be subject to waiver by the parties in accordance with Section 7.04 without notice or liability to any other
person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties. Consequently, persons other than the
parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances
as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

limitation.” Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to “Sections,” “Annexes” and “Exhibits” are intended to
refer to Sections of this Agreement and the Annexes and Exhibits to this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to “$” are
intended to refer to U.S. dollars. The term “or” shall not be deemed to be exclusive. The words “hereof,” “herein” and “hereunder”
and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement. In this Agreement, references to “as of the date of this Agreement” or words of similar import shall be deemed to

reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, subject to Section 7.02, the parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, and (ii) the provisions set forth in Section 7.02 are not intended to
and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and shall not be construed to
diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any party’s right to specific performance or other equitable relief. If on the Outside
Date, there is a pending Proceeding that has been brought by a party hereto seeking the remedies provided for in this Section
8.10, then, without further action, the Outside Date shall be automatically extended until the date that is five Business Days
after the dismissal, settlement or entry of a final non-appealable order with respect to such Proceeding or such other time period
established by the court presiding over such Proceeding.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (including Section 8.10(a)), it is acknowledged and agreed
that, prior to a valid termination of the Agreement in accordance with Section 7.01, the Company shall be entitled to obtain
specific performance to cause Parent and Sub to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Closing in
accordance with Section 1.02 only if: (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 and Section 6.02 have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing, but each of which is capable of being
satisfied at the Closing and is reasonably expected to be satisfied as of the Closing) on the date the Closing is required to have
occurred pursuant to Section 1.02, (ii) the Debt Financing contemplated by clause (i) of the definition thereof has been funded
or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in
a written notice to Parent (and shall not have purported to revoke such notice) that (A) all conditions set forth in Section 6.01
and Section 6.02 have been satisfied or irrevocably waived (other than those conditions which, by their nature, are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing), and (B) if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing and Debt
Financing contemplated by clause (i) of the definition thereof are funded, the Company stands ready, willing and able to
consummate the Closing pursuant to Section 1.02. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to
enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parent’s obligations to cause the Equity Financing to be funded or to consummate the
Transactions if the Debt Financing contemplated by clause (i) of the definition thereof has not been funded (or will not be
funded at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to Section 8.10(d) and Section 7.02 (solely in
the case when this Agreement is terminated), the Company hereby agrees that, prior to the Closing, specific performance as
provided for in this Section 8.10 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to breaches by Parent or Sub in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) and that it may
not seek or accept any other form of relief that may be available for breach under this Agreement or otherwise in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including monetary damages).

(d) If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and to consummate the Closing in accordance with Section 1.02 pursuant to a claim for specific
performance brought against Parent pursuant to Section 8.10(b) at a time when the conditions set forth in the first sentence of
Section 8.10(b) are satisfied and has instead granted an award of damages for such alleged breach of Parent’s obligation to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Closing in accordance with Section 1.02, the Company may
enforce such award and accept damages for such alleged breach only if, within ten (10) Business Days following such
determination (i) the Company confirms to the Parent in writing that the Company stands ready, willing and able to
consummate the Closing pursuant to Section 1.02 (whether or not this Agreement has previously been terminated), and (ii)
Parent does not consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within ten (10) Business Days of such written
confirmation in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that notwithstanding

other form of relief that may be available to it under this Agreement, including under Section 7.02, in the event that this
Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this Section 8.10 are not available or otherwise
are not granted, (ii) nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require a party to institute any Proceeding for (or limit a party’s
right to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 8.10 prior, or as a condition, to exercising any
termination right under Article VII, nor shall the commencement of any Proceeding seeking remedies pursuant to this Section
8.10 or anything set forth in this Section 8.10 restrict or limit a party’s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the
terms of Article VII or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter and (iii) no
party shall require the other to post any bond or other security as a condition to institute any Proceeding for specific
performance under this Section 8.10. While the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance as and only to the
extent permitted by this Section 8.10 and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or damages as provided by Section
7.02(c)(ii), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both such grant of specific
performance (or damages contemplated pursuant to Section 8.10(d)) and the payment of the Reverse Termination Fee or
damages pursuant to Section 7.02(c)(ii).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company on behalf of itself and the Company Related
Parties hereby waives any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Source or any Debt Financing Source Related Party,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and the Company on behalf of itself and the Company Related Parties
agrees not to commence (and if commenced agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate) any Proceeding against any Debt
Financing Source or any Debt Financing Source Related Party in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any Proceeding related to the Debt Financing). In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, it is agreed that no Debt Financing Source or any Debt Financing Source Related Party shall have any liability for
any losses to the Company or any Company Related Party in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and in no event shall the Company or any Company Related Party be entitled to seek the remedy of specific
performance of this Agreement against any Debt Financing Source or any Debt Financing Source Related Party. Nothing in this
Section 8.10 shall in any way limit or qualify the liabilities of the Debt Financing Sources or the Debt Financing Source Related
Parties and the other parties to the Debt Financing to each other thereunder or in connection therewith.

Section 8.11 Attorneys’ Fees.  In any action at law or suit in equity to enforce this Agreement or the rights of any of the parties
hereunder, the prevailing party in such action or suit shall be entitled to receive a reasonable sum for its attorneys’ fees and all other
reasonable costs and expenses incurred in such action or suit.

2.

(a) Each person who has been or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a “proceeding”), by reason of the fact that he or
she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including, without limitation, service with respect to employee benefit plans (hereinafter
an “Indemnitee”), whether the basis of such proceeding is an alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer,
employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or any
other applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Corporation shall indemnify any such Indemnitee seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof)
initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the Corporation.
The right to indemnification conferred in this Article FIFTH, Section 2 shall be a contract right. In addition to the right of
indemnification, an Indemnitee shall have the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that if the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware,
or any other applicable law, requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a
director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer,
including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be
made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article
FIFTH, Section 2 or otherwise.

(b) If a claim under paragraph (a) of this Article FIFTH, Section 2 is not paid in full by the Corporation within 30 days after
a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation
to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the
expense of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for
expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is
required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standard of conduct which makes it
permissible under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or any other applicable law, for the Corporation to
indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including, without limitation, its board of directors, stockholders or independent legal counsel) to
have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the
circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware, or any other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including, without limitation, its
board of directors, stockholders or independent legal counsel) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct.

(c) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final
disposition conferred in paragraph (b) of this Article FIFTH, Section 2 shall not be exclusive of any other right which any
person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, agreement, vote
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

(d) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or any other applicable law.

(e) The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the board of directors, grant rights to
indemnification, and rights to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its
final disposition, to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article FIFTH,
Section 2 with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

(f) Any repeal or modification of this Article FIFTH, Section 2 shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification.

With respect to the information used in arriving at our opinion:

• We have relied upon and assumed the accuracy, completeness and reasonableness of all industry, business, financial, legal,
regulatory, tax, accounting, actuarial and other information (including, without limitation, the Projections, other estimates
and other forward-looking information) furnished by or discussed with West Marine or obtained from public sources, data
suppliers and other third parties.

• We (i) do not assume any responsibility, obligation or liability for the accuracy, completeness, reasonableness, achievability
or independent verification of, and we have not independently verified, any such information (including, without limitation,
the Projections, any other estimates and any other forward-looking information), (ii) express no view, opinion,
representation, guaranty or warranty (in each case, express or implied) regarding the reasonableness or achievability of the
Projections, any other estimates and any other forward-looking information or the assumptions upon which they are based
and (iii) have relied upon the assurances of West Marine’s senior management that they are unaware of any facts or
circumstances that would make such information (including, without limitation, the Projections, any other estimates and
any other forward-looking information) incomplete, inaccurate or misleading.

• Specifically, with respect to (i) the Projections, any other estimates and any other forward-looking information furnished by
or discussed with West Marine, (a) we have been advised by West Marine’s senior management and we have assumed, that
the Projections, other estimates and other forward-looking information utilized in our analyses have been reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of West Marine’s senior management as to
the expected future performance of West Marine and the corporate income tax rates applicable to the Projections and (b) we
have assumed that such Projections, other estimates and such other forward-looking information have been reviewed by
West Marine’s Board of Directors with the understanding that such information will be used and relied upon by us in
connection with rendering our opinion and (ii) any projections, any other estimates and/or any other forward-looking
information obtained by us from public sources, data suppliers and other third parties, we have assumed that such
information is reasonable and reliable.

During the course of our engagement, we were asked by West Marine’s Board of Directors to solicit indications of interest from
various potential strategic and private equity acquirors regarding a potential transaction with West Marine, and we have considered
the results of such solicitation process in rendering our opinion.

In arriving at our opinion, we have not performed or obtained any independent appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including
any contingent, derivative or off-balance sheet assets and liabilities) of West Marine or any other entity or the solvency or fair value
of West Marine or any other entity, nor have we been furnished with any such appraisals. We are not legal, regulatory, tax,
consulting, accounting, appraisal or actuarial experts and nothing in our opinion should be construed as constituting advice with
respect to such matters; accordingly, we have relied on the assessments of West Marine and its other advisors with respect to such
matters. West Marine’s senior management has advised us that the Projections, all other estimates and all other forward-looking
information reflect the current US federal corporate income tax regime pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended;
at the direction of West Marine’s Board of Directors and senior management, we have not considered or analyzed the impacts of
any potential or proposed reform thereof in connection with our opinion and analyses. We are not expressing any view or rendering
any opinion regarding the tax consequences of the Merger to West Marine or its stockholders.

In rendering our opinion, we have assumed that, in all respects meaningful to our analyses, (i) the final executed form of the
Agreement will not differ from the draft that we have reviewed, (ii) West Marine, Parent and Merger Sub will comply with all
terms of the Agreement and (iii) the representations and warranties of West Marine, Parent and Merger Sub contained in the
Agreement are true and correct and all conditions to the obligations of each party to the Agreement to consummate the Merger will
be satisfied without any waiver, amendment or modification thereof. We also have assumed that the Merger will be consummated
in a timely manner in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and in compliance with all applicable laws, documents and other
requirements, without any delays, limitations, restrictions, conditions, waivers, amendments or modifications (regulatory, tax-
related or otherwise) that would have an effect on West Marine or the Merger in any way meaningful to our analyses or opinion.

In rendering our opinion, we do not express any view or opinion as to the price or range of prices at which the Shares or other
securities of West Marine may trade or otherwise be transferable at any time, including subsequent to the announcement or
consummation of the Merger.

We have acted as a financial advisor to West Marine in connection with the Merger and will receive a customary fee for such
services, a substantial portion of which is contingent on successful consummation of the Merger. A portion of our compensation is
payable upon delivery of our opinion and will be credited against the fee payable upon consummation of the Merger. In addition,
West Marine has agreed to reimburse us for certain expenses and to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising out of our
engagement.

As previously disclosed to the Board of Directors, aside from our current engagement by West Marine, Guggenheim Securities
has not been previously engaged during the past two years by West Marine, nor has Guggenheim Securities been previously
engaged during the past two years by Monomoy, to provide financial advisory or investment banking services for which we
received fees. Guggenheim Securities may seek to provide West Marine and Monomoy and their respective affiliates with certain
financial advisory and investment banking services unrelated to the Merger in the future, for which services Guggenheim Securities
would expect to receive compensation.

Guggenheim Securities and its affiliates and related entities engage in a wide range of financial services activities for our and
their own accounts and the accounts of our and their customers, including: asset, investment and wealth management; insurance
services; investment banking, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and restructuring; merchant banking; fixed income and
equity sales, trading and research; and derivatives, foreign exchange and futures. In the ordinary course of these activities,
Guggenheim Securities or its affiliates and related entities may (i) provide such financial services to West Marine, Monomoy, other
participants in the Merger or their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, investment funds and portfolio companies, for which services
Guggenheim Securities or its affiliates and related entities has received, and may receive, compensation and (ii) directly or
indirectly, hold long or short positions, trade and otherwise conduct such activities in or with respect to certain bank debt, debt or
equity securities and derivative products of or

Annex C

APPRAISAL RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS
GENERAL CORPORATION LAW OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE

§ 262. Appraisal rights.

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to
subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the
merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court
of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholder’s shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of
this section. As used in this section, the word “stockholder” means a holder of record of stock in a corporation; the words “stock”
and “share” mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words; and the words “depository receipt” mean a receipt or other
instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation,
which stock is deposited with the depository.

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or
consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title and, subject to
paragraph (b)(3) of this section, § 251(h) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 255, § 256, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title:

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in § 363(b) of this title, no appraisal rights under this section shall
be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record
date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of
merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000
holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation
surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as
provided in § 251(f) of this title.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of
any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of
merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock
anything except:

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in
respect thereof;

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or
depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be
either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders;

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b.
of this section; or

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional
depository receipts described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 251(h), § 253 or §
267 of this title is not owned by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of
the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporation’s certificate of incorporation contemplated by § 363(a) of this title,
appraisal rights shall be available as contemplated by § 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of this section, including those
set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply

TABLE OF CONTENTS

as nearly as practicable, with the word “amendment” substituted for the words “merger or consolidation,” and the word
“corporation” substituted for the words “constituent corporation” and/or “surviving or resulting corporation.”

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for
the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or
consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the
corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable.

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for
approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its
stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance
with § 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this
section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such
notice a copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Each
stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of
the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. Such demand will be
sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to
demand the appraisal of such stockholder’s shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not constitute such
a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within ten
days after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder
of each constituent corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented to the merger
or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation has become effective; or

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228, § 251(h), § 253, or § 267 of this title, then either a
constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within
ten days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are
entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all
shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section
and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of § 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on
or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger
or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice or, in
the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer contemplated
by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting
corporation the appraisal of such holder’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holder’s shares. If such
notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent
corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of
any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger
or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within ten
days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of
the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to § 251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of
the offer contemplated by § 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need
only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holder’s shares in
accordance with this

subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give
either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance,
a record date that shall be not more than ten days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or
after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and
the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on
which the notice is given.

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any
stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights,
may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the
stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or
consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall
have the right to withdraw such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or
consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation
surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor
of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of
holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within ten days after such stockholder’s written
request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within ten days after expiration of the period for
delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of
this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of
such person may, in such person’s own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this
subsection.

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting
corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was
filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and
with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition
shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register
in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or
certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such
notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the
notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting
corporation.

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who
have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares
and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon
of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the
proceedings as to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the shares of the class or series of stock of
the constituent corporation as to which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities exchange, the Court shall
dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total number of
shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the
consideration provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was
approved pursuant to § 253 or § 267 of this title.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in
accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such
proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment
or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair
value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion
determines otherwise for good cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the effective date of the merger
through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger
and the date of payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the proceedings, the surviving corporation
may pay to each stockholder entitled to appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as provided
herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by
the Court, and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation
or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the
appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the
list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such
stockholder’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is
finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting
corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of
uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of
the certificates representing such stock. The Court’s decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be
enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state.

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the
circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder
in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as
provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or
other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to
the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the
time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written
withdrawal of such stockholder’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days
after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written
approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such
approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the
right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw
such stockholder’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the
effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section.

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been
converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving
or resulting corporation.

(c) Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission, “.pdf,” or other
electronic transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same

(d) Entire Agreement, No Third-Party Beneficiaries.  This Agreement (i) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and

Agreement.

(e) Governing Law, Jurisdiction.  This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to any conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the Law of any other state
or jurisdiction. Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related
to this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby exclusively in the Delaware
Court of Chancery (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware or

transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that

other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

(i) Specific Performance.  The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including any party hereto failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, (i) the parties hereto will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches (or threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof; and (ii) the
right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Agreement and without that right, Parent would not have entered into
this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that each party hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity and any party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party hereto
irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or other
security.

(j) Amendment.  No amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless it shall be in writing and signed by
each of the parties hereto, and no waiver or consent hereunder shall be effective against any party unless it shall be in
writing and signed by such party.

(k) Binding Nature.  This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall be enforceable by and inure solely to the benefit of, the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

(l) No Recourse.  Parent and Sub agree that Stockholder will not be liable for claims, losses, damages, expenses and other
liabilities or obligations resulting from or related to the Merger Agreement or the Merger (other than any liability for claims,
losses, damages, expenses and other liabilities or obligations solely to the extent arising under, and in accordance with the
terms of, this Agreement), including the Company’s breach of the Merger Agreement.

(m)No Presumption.  This Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement.

(n) No Agreement Until Executed.  This Agreement shall not be effective unless and until (i) the Merger Agreement is executed
by all parties thereto and (ii) this Agreement is executed by all parties hereto.

(o) No Ownership Interest.  Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in Parent or Sub any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to the
Stockholder Securities. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Stockholder Securities shall
remain vested in and belong to Stockholder, and neither Parent nor Sub shall have any authority to manage, direct, restrict,
regulate, govern, or administer any of the policies or operations of the Company or exercise any power or authority to direct
