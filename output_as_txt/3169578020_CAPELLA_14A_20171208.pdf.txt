MERGER PROPOSAL—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

December 8, 2017

Dear Shareholders of Capella Education Company and Stockholders of Strayer Education, Inc.:

          The boards of directors of Capella Education Company ("Capella") and Strayer Education, Inc. ("Strayer") have unanimously approved a merger. Capella and Strayer entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 29, 2017 (the "merger agreement"), pursuant to which a wholly owned subsidiary of Strayer will merge with and into
Capella, with Capella becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Strayer (the "merger"). Upon consummation of the merger, Capella and Strayer, and their respective subsidiaries, will
operate as a combined company under the name "Strategic Education, Inc."

          Upon consummation of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of Capella common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.875 shares of common stock of
Strayer (the "merger exchange ratio"), par value $0.01 per share, and cash in lieu of fractional shares. This merger exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in the market
price of either Capella common stock or Strayer common stock between the date of signing of the merger agreement and consummation of the merger.

          Following the merger, Capella shareholders and Strayer stockholders are expected to own approximately 48% and 52%, respectively, of the outstanding combined company
shares on a fully diluted basis, based on the number of shares currently expected to be outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. The Capella common stock
and the Strayer common stock are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbols "CPLA" and "STRA," respectively. Following the merger, the common stock of
the combined company will be listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under Strayer's current symbol, "STRA."

          To obtain the approvals of the Capella shareholders and the Strayer stockholders required in connection with the merger, Capella will hold a special meeting of its
shareholders (the "Capella special meeting") and Strayer will hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the "Strayer special meeting").

          At the Capella special meeting, Capella shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on, among other things, a proposal to approve the merger agreement (the "Capella
Merger Proposal").

          At the Strayer special meeting, Strayer stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on, among other things, the issuance of shares of Strayer common stock to the Capella
shareholders in connection with the merger (the "Share Issuance Proposal"), and the amendment and restatement of the Strayer charter (together with the Share Issuance Proposal,
the "Strayer Required Proposals").

          We cannot consummate the merger unless the stockholders of Strayer and the shareholders of Capella approve the respective required proposals of each company as described
herein. Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you expect to attend either special meeting in person, please submit a proxy
to vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares may be represented and voted at the Capella or Strayer special meeting, as applicable.

          The Capella board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Capella and its shareholders. The Capella board of directors unanimously recommends
that Capella shareholders vote "FOR" the Capella Merger Proposal and "FOR" each of the other proposals to be considered at the Capella special meeting and
described in the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus.

          The Strayer board of directors has unanimously approved the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, including the merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Strayer and its stockholders. The Strayer board of directors unanimously recommends
that Strayer stockholders vote "FOR" the Strayer Required Proposals and "FOR" each of the other proposals to be considered at the Strayer special meeting and
described in the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus.

          The obligations of Capella and Strayer to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of several conditions set forth in the merger agreement. The
accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus contains detailed information about Capella, Strayer, the special meetings, the merger agreement, the merger and the other
transactions contemplated thereby. Capella and Strayer encourage you to read the joint proxy statement/prospectus carefully. In particular, you should read the "Risk
Factors" section beginning on page 35 of the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus for a discussion of the risks you should consider in evaluating the merger
and how they will affect you.

          On behalf of the Capella board of directors and the Strayer board of directors, thank you for your consideration and continued support.

          Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the merger or the securities to be issued in
connection with the merger or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of the disclosure in the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus. Any representation to the
contrary is a criminal offense.

          The accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus is dated December 8, 2017 and is first being mailed to the Capella shareholders and Strayer stockholders on or about
December 14, 2017.

To the Shareholders of Capella Education Company:

        We cordially invite you to attend a special meeting of the shareholders of Capella Education Company ("Capella") being held in
connection with a proposed merger with Strayer Education, Inc. ("Strayer").

        The meeting will be held at 8:00 a.m. local time, on January 19, 2018, at Capella's corporate headquarters located at Capella Tower,
225 South Sixth Street, 3rd Floor, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402 (referred to as the "Capella special meeting"). At the Capella special
meeting, you will be asked:

1. Merger Proposal. To consider and act upon a proposal to approve the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
October 29, 2017 (the "merger agreement"), by and among Capella, Strayer and Sarg Sub Inc. ("Merger Sub"), a copy of
which is attached as Annex A to the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus, and the merger and other transactions
contemplated thereby (the "Capella Merger Proposal"); 

2. Adjournment Proposal. To consider and act upon a proposal to approve the adjournment of the Capella special meeting to
another date and place if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional votes in favor of the Capella Merger Proposal (the
"Capella Adjournment Proposal"); and 

3. Advisory Compensation Proposal. To consider and act upon a proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the
compensation that may become payable to Capella's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the
merger, as disclosed in "The Merger—Interests of Capella's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" of the
accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus (referred to as the "Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal" and,
together with the Capella Merger Proposal and the Capella Adjournment Proposal, the "Capella Proposals").

        Approval of the Capella Merger Proposal is required for the consummation of the merger. Neither the approval of the Capella
Adjournment Proposal nor the approval of the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal is required for the consummation of the merger.

        Approval of the Capella Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all shares of

affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of (1) a majority of the voting power of the shares present and entitled to vote on that item of

transaction of business at the Capella special meeting. Approval of the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal requires that the votes

Table of Contents

        Each of the Capella Proposals is described in more detail in the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus, which you should
read carefully in its entirety.

        The failure of any shareholder of record of Capella to submit a signed proxy card, grant a proxy electronically over the Internet or by
telephone or to vote in person by ballot at the special meeting will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Capella Merger
Proposal, but will not have an effect on the outcome of the Capella Adjournment Proposal or the Capella Advisory Compensation
Proposal. If you hold your shares in "street name," failure to instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares will
have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Capella Merger Proposal, but will not have any effect on the Capella Adjournment
Proposal or the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Capella
Merger Proposal and the Capella Adjournment Proposal, but will not have any effect on the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal.

        The Capella board of directors has set December 11, 2017 as the record date for the Capella special meeting. Only holders of record
of shares of Capella common stock as of the close of business on December 11, 2017 will be entitled to notice of and to vote at the Capella
special meeting and any adjournments thereof. Any shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the Capella special meeting is entitled to
appoint a proxy to attend and vote on such shareholder's behalf. Such proxy need not be a holder of shares of Capella common stock.

        Your vote is very important. To ensure your representation at the Capella special meeting, please complete and return the
enclosed proxy card or submit your proxy by telephone or through the Internet. Please submit your proxy promptly whether or not
you expect to attend the Capella special meeting. Submitting a proxy now will not prevent you from being able to vote in person at the
Capella special meeting. If your shares of Capella common stock are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, follow the
instructions on the voting instruction card furnished to you by such bank, broker or other nominee.

        The Capella board of directors has unanimously adopted and approved the merger agreement and the consummation of the
merger, and has determined that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable, fair to, and in the best interests of Capella
and its shareholders. The Capella board of directors therefore unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the Capella Merger
Proposal, "FOR" the Capella Adjournment Proposal and "FOR" the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal.

 By Order of the Board of Directors,

 
Renee L. Jackson
Secretary

Proposal, the "Strayer Proposals").

        The approval by Strayer stockholders of both the Share Issuance Proposal and the Charter Amendment Proposal is a condition to the

the votes entitled to be cast on the Charter Amendment Proposal. To be approved, the Strayer Adjournment Proposal requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast thereon at the meeting.

have an effect on the outcome of the Share Issuance Proposal or the Strayer Adjournment Proposal. If you hold your shares of Strayer
common stock in "street name" through a bank, broker or other nominee and you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on

with respect to your shares of Strayer common stock as promptly as possible by: (1) accessing the Internet website specified on

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE SPECIAL MEETINGS 

        The following are brief answers to certain questions that you may have regarding the merger agreement, the merger, the issuance of
shares of Strayer common stock in connection with the merger, the amendment and restatement of the Strayer charter, the Capella special
meeting, the Strayer special meeting and the consideration to be received in the merger. You are urged to read carefully this entire joint
proxy statement/prospectus because the information in this section may not provide all of the information that might be important to you in
determining how to vote. Additional important information is also contained in the annexes and exhibits to, and the documents
incorporated by reference into, this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See "Where You Can Find More Information."

Q: What is the proposed transaction? 

A: On October 29, 2017, Capella Education Company ("Capella"), Strayer Education, Inc. ("Strayer"), and Sarg Sub Inc., a wholly
owned direct subsidiary of Strayer ("Merger Sub"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "merger agreement")
pursuant to which they agreed to a merger, with Strayer as the remaining corporate entity under which Strayer University and
Capella University will operate (the "combined company").

The merger contemplated by the merger agreement will be implemented through a merger of Merger Sub with and into Capella,
with Capella becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the combined company (the "merger"). In the merger, each share of common
stock of Capella, par value $0.01 per share ("Capella common stock") issued and outstanding (other than shares held by Strayer,
Capella or Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) immediately prior to the effective time of the merger
(the "effective time") will be converted into the right to receive 0.875 (the "merger exchange ratio") shares of common stock of
Strayer, par value $0.01 per share ("Strayer common stock," referred to as "combined company shares" as of the consummation of
and following the merger), plus cash in lieu of fractional shares (such consideration, the "merger consideration"). In connection
with the merger, the Strayer charter will be amended and restated to, among other things, change the name of Strayer
Education, Inc. to "Strategic Education, Inc.," which will be the name of the combined company.

After consummation of the merger, Capella shareholders and Strayer stockholders are expected to own approximately 48% and
52%, respectively, of the outstanding combined company shares on a fully diluted basis, based on the number of shares currently
expected to be outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. Following the consummation of the merger, the combined
company shares will be listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ("NASDAQ") and are expected to trade under the current
Strayer symbol, "STRA."

Q: Why are Capella and Strayer proposing the merger? 

A: The Capella board of directors and the Strayer board of directors each believe that the proposed merger will provide a number of
significant potential strategic benefits and opportunities that will be in the best interests of the Capella shareholders and Strayer
stockholders, respectively. To review the reasons for the proposed merger in greater detail, see "The Merger—Capella's Reasons
for the Merger; Recommendation of the Capella Board of Directors" beginning on page 74 and "The Merger—Strayer's Reasons
for the Merger; Recommendation of the Strayer Board of Directors" beginning on page 78. 

Q: Why am I receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus? 

A: Each of Capella and Strayer is sending these materials to the Capella shareholders and Strayer stockholders, respectively, to help
them decide how to vote their shares of Capella common stock, and/or their shares of Strayer common stock, as the case may be,
with respect to the matters to be

considered at the special meeting of shareholders of Capella (the "Capella special meeting") and the special meeting of
stockholders of Strayer (the "Strayer special meeting"), respectively.

Consummation of the merger requires approval by both Capella shareholders and Strayer stockholders. To obtain these required
approvals, Capella will hold the Capella special meeting to ask the Capella shareholders to approve, among other things, a proposal
to approve the merger agreement (the "Capella Merger Proposal"), and Strayer will hold the Strayer special meeting to ask the
Strayer stockholders to approve, among other things, the issuance of shares of Strayer common stock to the Capella shareholders in
connection with the merger and the amendment and restatement of the Strayer charter (collectively, the "Strayer Required
Proposals").

Further information about the Capella special meeting, the Strayer special meeting, the merger agreement, the merger, the issuance
of shares of Strayer common stock in connection with the merger, the amendment and restatement of the Strayer charter and the
merger consideration is contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This joint proxy statement/prospectus constitutes both a
joint proxy statement of Capella and Strayer and a prospectus of Strayer. It is a joint proxy statement because it will be used by
both the Capella board of directors in soliciting proxies from the Capella shareholders and the Strayer board of directors in
soliciting proxies from the Strayer stockholders. It is a prospectus because Strayer, in connection with the merger, is offering shares
of Strayer common stock (which, as noted above, we refer to as combined company shares as of the consummation of and
following the merger) in exchange for the shares of outstanding Capella common stock.

The enclosed proxy materials allow you to submit a proxy by telephone or over the Internet, or by signing and returning the
enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided, without attending the applicable company's special meeting in person.

Your vote is very important. You are encouraged to submit your proxy as soon as possible by telephone or over the Internet, or by
signing and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided, even if you do plan to attend the Capella
special meeting or the Strayer special meeting in person.

Q: What will Capella shareholders receive in the merger? 

A: In the merger, each share of Capella common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than
shares held in treasury or held by Strayer, Capella or Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) will be
converted into the right to receive 0.875 shares of Strayer common stock (which, as noted above, we refer to as combined company
shares as of the consummation of and following the merger). No fractional shares of Strayer common stock will be issued to
Capella shareholders in connection with the merger. Instead, the combined company will pay to each former holder of Capella
common stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional combined company share an amount in cash (without
interest) determined by multiplying (i) the fraction of a combined company share which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive (taking into account all shares of Capella common stock held by such holder) by (ii) the daily volume weighted average
price ("VWAP") of one share of Strayer common stock for a ten (10) day trading period, starting with the opening of trading on the
eleventh (11th) trading day prior to the date of consummation of the merger (the "closing date") and ending on the closing of
trading on the second (2nd) to last trading day prior to the closing date, as reported by Bloomberg L.P. 

Q: What will happen to my shares of Strayer common stock? 

A: Nothing. You will continue to own the same shares of Strayer common stock that you own prior to the effective time. As a result of
the issuance of additional shares of Strayer common stock to

former Capella shareholders, however, the overall ownership percentage of the current Strayer stockholders in the combined
company will be reduced.

Q: When will the merger be consummated? 

A: The merger is expected to be consummated during the third quarter of 2018. However, neither Capella nor Strayer can predict the
actual date on which the merger will be consummated, or whether it will be consummated at all, because the merger is subject to
factors beyond each company's control, including the receipt (and timing) of required regulatory approvals, approval of the Capella
Merger Proposal by Capella shareholders and approval of the Strayer Required Proposals by Strayer stockholders. See "The
Merger Agreement—Conditions to Consummation of the Merger." 

Q: What are the conditions to the consummation of the merger? 

A: In addition to approval of the Capella Merger Proposal by Capella shareholders and approval of the Strayer Required Proposals by
Strayer stockholders, consummation of the merger is subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver
of a number of other conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals. See "The Merger Agreement—Conditions
to Consummation of the Merger." 

Q: What effect will the merger have on Capella and Strayer? 

A: At the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with and into Capella, with Capella surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Strayer as the combined company. Following the consummation of the merger, Capella shares will no longer be listed on
NASDAQ or any other stock exchange or quotation system, and Capella will cease to be a publicly traded company. Pursuant to
the merger agreement, Strayer as the combined company will be the remaining corporate entity under which both universities will
operate as independent and separately accredited institutions.

Shares of Strayer common stock, which we refer to as combined company shares as of the consummation of and following the
merger, will continue to be registered and subject to reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act"), following the consummation of the merger. In connection with the merger, Strayer will change its name to
"Strategic Education, Inc." The combined company shares will continue to be listed on NASDAQ and are expected to trade under
the current Strayer symbol, "STRA," following the merger.

Q: Who will serve as the directors and senior officers of the combined company? 

A: At the effective time, the board of directors of the combined company will consist of (a) nine directors designated by Strayer, (b) J.
Kevin Gilligan, Chief Executive Officer of Capella, and (c) two additional designees who are currently members of the Capella
board of directors and are recommended by Mr. Gilligan. In addition, one of the two additional Capella designees will be
appointed to serve on the Compensation Committee of the combined company.

Robert Silberman will continue as Executive Chairman of the board of directors of the combined company and Mr. Gilligan will be
appointed as Vice Chairman at the effective time. Karl McDonnell, Strayer's current President and Chief Executive Officer, and
Daniel W. Jackson, Strayer's current Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will continue in their respective
positions at the combined company following the effective time. Steven L. Polacek, Capella's current Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer, will be appointed as the Chief Integration/Transition Officer of the combined company.

the "Capella Proposals").

Approval of the Capella Merger Proposal is required for consummation of the merger. Neither the approval of the Capella

No other matters are intended to be brought before the Capella special meeting by Capella.

count for this proposal.

Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal. For the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal, an abstention or a failure to

Q: How does the Capella board of directors recommend Capella shareholders vote? 

A: The Capella board of directors has determined that the merger agreement and the merger are advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of Capella and the Capella shareholders, and has approved and adopted the merger agreement and the merger. The Capella

2. "FOR" the Capella Adjournment Proposal; and 

3. "FOR" the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal.

Q: Do any of Capella's directors or executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
those of Capella shareholders? 

A: Yes. Capella's directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the
interests of Capella shareholders generally. See "The Merger—Interests of Capella's Directors and Executive Officers in the

together with the Share Issuance Proposal and the Charter Amendment Proposal, the "Strayer Proposals").

Approvals by Strayer stockholders of the Share Issuance Proposal and the Charter Amendment Proposal are conditions to the
consummation of the merger. If either the Share Issuance Proposal or the Charter Amendment Proposal is not approved, the merger
will not be consummated.

No other matters may be brought before the Strayer special meeting.

Q: What vote is required to approve each proposal at the Strayer special meeting?

Q: How does the Strayer board of directors recommend Strayer stockholders vote? 

A: The Strayer board of directors has determined that the merger agreement, the issuance of Strayer common stock in the merger and
the amendment and restatement of the Strayer charter are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Strayer and the Strayer
stockholders. The Strayer board of directors therefore unanimously recommends that the Strayer stockholders vote: 

1. "FOR" the Share Issuance Proposal; 

2. "FOR" the Charter Amendment Proposal; and 

3. "FOR" the Strayer Adjournment Proposal.

6

A:  1.  Share Issuance Proposal:    To be approved, the Share Issuance Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the votes cast thereon at the Strayer special meeting, assuming a quorum is present. For the Share Issuance Proposal,
an abstention will not count as a vote in favor of or against this proposal, and an abstention or a failure to vote will not have an
effect on the outcome of this proposal. If you hold your shares of Strayer common stock in "street name" through a bank, broker
or other nominee and you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares, your bank, broker or
other nominee will not be permitted to vote your shares on the Share Issuance Proposal, and this non-vote will have no effect on
the outcome of this proposal.

  2.  Charter Amendment Proposal:    To be approved, the Charter Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the votes entitled to be cast on the Charter Amendment Proposal at the Strayer Special Meeting. For the Charter Amendment
Proposal, an abstention or a failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote cast "AGAINST" this proposal. If you hold your
shares of Strayer common stock in "street name" through a bank, broker or other nominee and you do not instruct your bank,
broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares, your bank, broker or other nominee will not be permitted to vote your
shares on the Charter Amendment Proposal, and this non-vote will have the same effect as a vote cast "AGAINST" this
proposal.

  3.  Strayer Adjournment Proposal:    To be approved, the Strayer Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders
of a majority of the votes cast thereon at the Strayer special meeting. For the Strayer Adjournment Proposal, an abstention will
not count as a vote in favor of or against this proposal, and an abstention or a failure to vote will not have an effect on the
outcome of the proposal. If you hold your shares of Strayer common stock in "street name" through a bank, broker or other
nominee and you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares, your bank, broker or other
nominee will not be permitted to vote your shares on the Strayer Adjournment Proposal, and this non-vote will have no effect on
the outcome of the proposal.

Q: Are there any risks about the merger or Capella's business that Strayer stockholders should consider in deciding whether to
vote for the Strayer Proposals? 

A: Yes. Before making any decision on whether and how to vote, Strayer stockholders are urged to read carefully and in its entirety
the information contained in "Risk Factors" beginning on page 35 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Strayer stockholders
should also read and carefully consider the risk factors of Capella and Strayer and the other risk factors that are incorporated by
reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See "Incorporation of Certain Documents by Reference" and "Where You Can
Find More Information." 

Q: Do any of Strayer's directors or executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to,
those of Strayer stockholders? 

A: Yes. Strayer's directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests
of Strayer stockholders. See "The Merger—Interests of Strayer's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger." The members of
the Strayer board of directors were aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the merger
agreement and the merger, and in recommending that the Strayer stockholders approve the Strayer Proposals. 

Q: Who else must approve the merger? 

A: Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), Capella and Strayer may not
consummate the merger until they have furnished certain information and materials to the Antitrust Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice (the "DOJ") and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), and the applicable waiting period has
expired or been terminated. On November 9, 2017, each of Capella and Strayer filed a Pre-Merger Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and the FTC, and on November 22, 2017, the FTC granted early
termination, effective immediately, of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. The consummation of the proposed
transaction is also subject to receipt of governmental and regulatory approvals from, among others, the U.S. Department of
Education (the "DOE") and the Higher Learning Commission (the "HLC"), which is the institutional accreditor for Capella
University. On November 28, 2017, Capella submitted a pre-acquisition review application to the DOE, and on December 1, 2017,
Capella filed a change of control application with the HLC. Additional information regarding regulatory approvals required for
consummation of the merger is set forth in "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Consummation of the Merger" and "The
Merger—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger." 

Q: What do I need to do now? 

A: After carefully reading and considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, please submit your
proxy or voting instruction card for your shares of Capella common stock or Strayer common stock, as applicable, as soon as
possible so that your shares will be represented at your respective company's special meeting. Please follow the instructions set
forth on the proxy card or on the voting instruction card provided by your bank, broker or other nominee if your shares are held in
"street name" through your bank, broker or other nominee.

A: If you are a shareholder of record of Capella as of the Capella record date, or a stockholder of record of Strayer as of the Strayer
record date, you may submit your proxy before your respective company's special meeting in one of the following ways:

3. complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope provided.

You may also cast your vote in person at your respective company's special meeting.

If your shares are held in "street name," through a bank, broker or other nominee, that institution will send you separate
instructions describing the procedure for voting your shares. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, broker or
other nominee. "Street name" stockholders or shareholders who wish to vote in person at the meeting will need to obtain a "legal
proxy" from their bank, broker or other nominee.

Q: How many votes do I have? 

A: Capella:    You are entitled to one vote for each share of Capella common stock that you owned as of the close of business on the
Capella record date. As of the close of business on December 6, 2017, the latest practicable date before the filing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, 11,623,793 shares of Capella common stock were outstanding.

Strayer:    You are entitled to one vote for each share of Strayer common stock that you owned as of the close of business on the
Strayer record date. As of the close of business on December 6, 2017, the latest practicable date before the filing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, 11,167,425 shares of Strayer common stock were outstanding.

Q: What if I transfer my shares of Capella common stock before the Capella special meeting, or I transfer my shares of Strayer
common stock before the Strayer special meeting? 

A: Capella:    If you transfer your shares of Capella common stock after the Capella record date but before the Capella special
meeting, unless you provide the transferee of your shares with a proxy, you will retain your right to vote at the Capella special
meeting, but will have transferred the right to receive the merger consideration. In order to receive combined company shares as a
result of the merger, you must hold your Capella shares through the effective time.

Strayer:    If you transfer your shares of Strayer common stock after the Strayer record date but before the Strayer special meeting,
unless you provide the transferee of your shares with a proxy, you will retain your right to vote at the Strayer special meeting.

Q: Should I send in my Capella stock certificates now? 

A: No. Any Capella shareholders who hold certificated shares of Capella common stock should keep their existing stock certificates at
this time. After the merger is consummated, Capella shareholders will receive from the exchange agent a letter of transmittal and
written instructions for exchanging their stock certificates for combined company shares. Strayer stockholders do not need to take
any action with respect to their stock certificates.

The combined company will not issue stock certificates in respect of any combined company shares issued in connection with the
merger, except as required by law. Capella shareholders who are entitled to receive the merger consideration will receive combined
company shares in book-entry form.

Q: Who is the exchange agent for the merger? 

A: American Stock Transfer & Trust Co. will be the exchange agent for the merger.

Q: When and where are the Capella special meeting and the Strayer special meeting? 

A: Capella:    The Capella special meeting will be held at 8:00 a.m. local time, on January 19, 2018, at Capella's corporate
headquarters located at Capella Tower, 225 South Sixth Street, 3rd Floor, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402.

Strayer:    The Strayer special meeting will be held at 9:00 a.m. local time, on January 19, 2018, at Strayer's corporate headquarters
located at 2303 Dulles Station Boulevard, Herndon, Virginia 20171.

Q: What constitutes a quorum? 

A: Capella:    The presence of Capella shareholders representing a majority of the voting power of all issued and outstanding shares
of Capella common stock entitled to vote at the Capella special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, is necessary to
constitute a quorum at the Capella special meeting. If a quorum is present when the Capella special meeting is convened, the
Capella shareholders present may continue to transact business until adjournment, even if the withdrawal of a number of the
Capella shareholders originally present leaves less than the proportion or number otherwise required for a quorum. Abstentions
will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum. Because, as described below, all proposals to
be voted on at the Capella special meeting will be "non-routine" matters, we do not expect to receive any broker non-votes (which
are shares of Capella common stock held by banks, brokers or other nominees with respect to which the bank, broker or other
nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and the bank, broker or other
nominee does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal), and if you do not provide voting instructions to your broker,
bank or other nominee, your shares will not be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum.

Strayer:    The presence in person or by proxy of Strayer stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all votes entitled to be cast at
the Strayer special meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum. Abstentions will be counted as present and entitled to vote for
purposes of determining a quorum. Because, as described below, all proposals to be voted on at the Strayer special meeting will be
"non-routine" matters, we do not expect to receive any broker non-votes (which are shares of Strayer common stock held by banks,
brokers or other nominees with respect to which the bank, broker or other nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of
such shares how to vote on a particular proposal and the bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power
on such proposal), and if you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, your shares will not be
counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum.

Q: If my shares are held in "street name" by a bank, broker or other nominee, will my bank, broker or other nominee vote my
shares for me? 

A: If your shares are held in "street name" in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you must provide your bank,
broker or other nominee with instructions on how to vote your shares. Please follow the instructions provided by your bank, broker
or other nominee. Please note that you may not submit a proxy with respect to shares held in "street name" by returning a proxy
card directly to Capella or Strayer or by voting in person at your respective company's special meeting unless you provide a "legal
proxy," which you must obtain from your bank, broker or other nominee.

Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, brokers who hold shares in "street name" for a beneficial owner of those shares
typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on "routine" proposals when they have not received instructions from
beneficial owners. Brokers are

not allowed to exercise their voting discretion with respect to the approval of matters that the New York Stock Exchange
determines to be "non-routine" without specific instructions from the beneficial owner. It is expected that all proposals to be voted
on at the Capella special meeting and the Strayer special meeting will be "non-routine" matters.

If you are a Capella shareholder and you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares:

• your bank, broker or other nominee will not be permitted to vote your shares on the Capella Merger Proposal, and this non-
vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" this proposal; 

• your bank, broker or other nominee will not be permitted to vote your shares on the Capella Adjournment Proposal or the
Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal, and this non-vote will have no effect on the vote counts for these proposals; and 

• your shares will not be counted towards determining whether a quorum is present.

If you are a Strayer stockholder and you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares:

• your bank, broker or other nominee will not be permitted to vote your shares on the Charter Amendment Proposal, and this
non-vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" this proposal; 

• your bank, broker or other nominee will not be permitted to vote your shares on the Share Issuance Proposal or the Strayer
Adjournment Proposal, and this non-vote will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals; and 

• your shares will not be counted towards determining whether a quorum is present. 

Q: What if I do not vote? 

A: If you are a Capella shareholder and you fail to vote, fail to submit a proxy or fail to return a voting instruction card instructing
your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote on the Capella Merger Proposal, or if you respond with an "abstain" vote on the
Capella Merger Proposal, this will have the same effect as a vote cast "AGAINST" the Capella Merger Proposal.

If you are a Capella shareholder and you fail to vote, fail to submit a proxy or fail to return a voting instruction card instructing
your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote, this will have no effect on the vote count for the Capella Adjournment Proposal or
the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal. If you are a Capella shareholder and you respond with an "abstain" vote on the
Capella Adjournment Proposal, this will have the same effect as a vote cast "AGAINST" the Capella Adjournment Proposal. If
you are a Capella shareholder and you respond with an "abstain" vote on the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal, this will
have no effect on the vote count for the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal.

If you fail to vote, fail to submit a proxy or fail to properly instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote with respect to
any of the Capella Proposals, your shares will not count towards determining whether a quorum is present. However, if you
respond with an "abstain" vote on any of the Capella Proposals, or vote on one or more of the Capella Proposals, your shares will
count towards determining whether a quorum is present.

If you are a Strayer stockholder and you fail to vote, fail to submit a proxy or fail to return a voting instruction card instructing
your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote, or if you respond with an "abstain" vote on the Charter Amendment Proposal, this
will have the same effect as a vote cast "AGAINST" the Charter Amendment Proposal.

nominee how to vote, or if you respond with an "abstain" vote on the Share Issuance Proposal or the Strayer Adjournment
Proposal, this will have no effect on the outcome of the Share Issuance Proposal or the Strayer Adjournment Proposal.

If you fail to vote, fail to submit a proxy or fail to properly instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote with respect to
any of the Strayer Proposals, your shares will not count towards determining whether a quorum is present. However, if you
respond with an "abstain" vote on any of the Strayer Proposals, your shares will count towards determining whether a quorum is
present.

An abstention occurs when a holder attends the applicable meeting in person and does not vote (assuming that such holder did not
previously authorize a proxy) or returns a proxy or voting instruction card with an "abstain" vote.

Please note that if you sign and return your proxy or voting instruction card without indicating how to vote on any particular
proposal (and you do not change your vote after delivering your proxy or voting instruction card), the shares of Capella common
stock represented by your proxy will be voted "FOR" each Capella Proposal in accordance with the recommendation of the
Capella board of directors, or the shares of Strayer common stock represented by your proxy will be voted "FOR" each Strayer
Proposal in accordance with the recommendation of the Strayer board of directors, as applicable. See the Q&A below entitled
"May I change my vote after I have delivered my proxy or voting instruction card?" for further information on how to change your
vote.

Your vote is very important. Whether or not you plan to attend the Capella special meeting or the Strayer special meeting,

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials? 

A: Capella shareholders and Strayer stockholders may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold shares of Capella
common stock or Strayer common stock in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting instruction card
for each brokerage account in which you hold such shares. If you are a holder of record of shares of Capella common stock or
Strayer common stock and your shares are registered in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. In
addition, if you are a holder of shares of both Capella common stock and Strayer common stock, you will receive one or more
separate proxy cards or voting instruction cards for each company. Therefore, if you are a record holder, please complete, sign,
date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card that you receive or otherwise follow the voting instructions set forth in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus to ensure that you vote every share of Capella common stock and/or every share of Strayer
common stock that you own. 

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Capella special meeting and the Strayer special meeting? 

A: Preliminary voting results are expected to be announced at the Capella special meeting and the Strayer special meeting and may be

A: Options to purchase shares of Capella common stock ("Capella stock options") that are outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time (whether vested or unvested) and held by a continuing employee of Capella or a director of Capella who will join the
board of directors of the combined company will automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be assumed
by Strayer and be converted into an option to acquire the number of whole shares of Strayer common stock (a "Strayer stock
option") on the same terms and conditions as the Capella stock option to which it relates, equal to the product of the merger
exchange ratio of 0.875 multiplied by the number of shares of Capella common stock subject to the option (rounded down to the
nearest whole share), and will have an exercise price per share equal to the quotient

obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of Capella common stock by the merger exchange ratio of 0.875 (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent). Capella stock options that are outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the consummation of the
merger and held by former employees, directors or consultants of Capella will automatically and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the amount of
merger consideration (if any) that the holder of such Capella stock option would have received had the Capella stock option been
exercised immediately prior to the effective time for shares of Capella common stock (net of the applicable exercise price), and
(ii) the VWAP of Strayer common stock for the ten (10) trading day period ending on the second to last trading day prior to the
effective time. Capella stock options that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and held by current Capella
directors who will not continue as members of the board of directors of the combined company following the effective time will
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the
merger consideration that the holder of such Capella stock option would have been entitled to receive if the Capella stock option
had been exercised for shares of Capella common stock immediately prior to the effective time (net of the applicable exercise
price).

Q: What if I hold Capella restricted stock units? 

A: All restricted stock units of Capella ("Capella RSUs") that are outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the merger
will be assumed by Strayer and will be converted into awards of restricted stock units of Strayer ("Strayer RSUs") and will
continue to have, and will be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the Capella RSUs immediately prior to the
effective time, with appropriate adjustments in the number of shares of Strayer common stock subject to the Strayer RSU to reflect
the merger exchange ratio. In addition, outstanding Capella RSUs granted to Capella directors under the Capella equity plans will
become fully and immediately vested upon the effective time. 

Q: What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. Holders of Capella shares? 

A: It is a condition to Strayer's obligation to consummate the merger that Strayer receive an opinion from its tax counsel, dated as of
the closing date, to the effect that the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). It is a condition to Capella's obligation to consummate the merger that Capella
receive an opinion from its tax counsel, dated as of the closing date, to the effect that the merger will qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Based on the tax opinion representations and assumptions (as defined on page
117), in the opinion of each of the tax counsels, the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined on page 116) of Capella common stock will not recognize any gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the exchange of shares of Capella common stock for shares of Strayer common stock in the
merger, except with respect to cash received by Capella shareholders in lieu of fractional shares. If any of the tax opinion
representations and assumptions is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated, the validity of the opinions described above
may be affected and the tax consequences of the merger could differ from those described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Please review the information set forth in the section entitled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" for a more
complete description of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. The tax consequences to you of the

Q: What happens if the trading price of Capella common stock or Strayer common stock changes before the consummation of the
merger? 

A: No change will be made to the merger exchange ratio if the trading price of Capella common stock or Strayer common stock
changes before the consummation of the merger. Accordingly, the exact value at the consummation of the merger of the combined

at the consummation of the merger. 

Q: What happens if the merger is not consummated? 

A: If the merger is not consummated, Capella shareholders will not receive the merger consideration in exchange for their shares of
Capella common stock. Instead, Strayer and Capella will remain independent public companies and the Capella common stock and
the Strayer common stock will continue to be listed and traded on NASDAQ under their current ticker symbols. Under specified
circumstances, Capella or Strayer may be required to pay to, or be entitled to receive from, the other party a fee or reimbursement
of expenses with respect to the termination of the merger agreement, as described under "The Merger Agreement—Termination
Fees and Expenses." 

Q: Do I need identification to attend the Capella special meeting or the Strayer special meeting in person? 

A: Yes.    Please bring proper identification, together with proof that you are a record owner of shares of Capella common stock or
Strayer common stock. If your shares are held in "street name," please bring acceptable proof of ownership, such as a letter from
your broker or an account statement stating or showing that you beneficially owned shares of Capella common stock or Strayer
common stock, as applicable, on the applicable record date.

Table of Contents

The Merger (See Page 63)

Transaction Structure

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Capella, with Capella surviving as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Strayer. In the merger, each share of Capella common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time (other than shares held in treasury or held by Strayer, Capella or Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned
subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to receive 0.875 combined company shares.

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, Strayer as the combined company will be the remaining corporate entity under which
Strayer University and Capella University will operate as independent and separately accredited institutions.

        After consummation of the merger, Capella and Strayer stockholders are expected to own approximately 48% and 52%,
respectively, of the outstanding combined company shares on a fully diluted basis, based on the number of shares currently expected
to be outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. Shares of Capella common stock currently trade on NASDAQ under the
symbol "CPLA," and shares of Strayer common stock currently trade on NASDAQ under the symbol "STRA." Following the
merger, the combined company shares will be listed on the NASDAQ and are expected to trade under the current Strayer symbol,
"STRA."

Treatment of Capella Equity Awards (See Page 121)

        At the effective time, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, outstanding Capella equity awards
will be treated as follows:

• Capella Stock Options.  Each Capella stock option that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
(whether vested or unvested) and held by a continuing employee or director of Capella will automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof be assumed by Strayer and be converted into a Strayer stock
option with the same terms and conditions as the Capella stock option to which it relates, equal to the product of the
merger exchange ratio of 0.875 multiplied by the number of shares of Capella common stock subject to the option
(rounded down to the nearest whole share), and will have an exercise price per share equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing the exercise price per share of Capella common stock by the merger exchange ratio of 0.875 (rounded up
to the nearest whole cent). Capella stock options that are outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the
consummation of the merger and held by former employees, directors or consultants of Capella will automatically
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash
payment equal to the product of (i) the amount of merger consideration (if any) that the holder of such Capella stock
option would have received had the Capella stock option been exercised immediately prior to the effective time for
shares of Capella common stock (net of the applicable exercise price), and (ii) the VWAP of Strayer common stock
for the ten (10) trading day period ending on the second to last trading day prior to the effective time. Capella stock
options that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and held by current Capella directors who will
not continue as members of the Strayer board of directors following the effective time will automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger
consideration that the holder of such Capella stock option would have been entitled to receive if the Capella stock
option had been exercised for shares of Capella common stock immediately prior to the effective time (net of the
applicable exercise price). 

• Capella Restricted Stock Unit Awards.  All Capella RSUs that are outstanding immediately prior to the
consummation of the merger will be assumed by Strayer and will be converted into awards of Strayer RSUs and will
continue to have, and will be subject to, the same terms and

Table of Contents

conditions as applied to the Capella RSUs immediately prior to the effective time, with appropriate adjustments in
the number of shares of Strayer common stock subject to the Strayer RSU to reflect the merger exchange ratio. In
addition, outstanding Capella RSUs granted to Capella directors under the Capella equity plans will become fully
and immediately vested upon the effective time.

Litigation Relating to the Merger (See Page 115) 

        A putative class action lawsuit has been filed by a Capella shareholder challenging the disclosures made in connection with the
merger. The lawsuit seeks to enjoin the merger, to recover damages if the merger is consummated, attorney's fees, and other relief.
For a more detailed description of litigation in connection with the merger, see "The Merger—Litigation Relating to the Merger."

Board and Management of the Combined Company (See Page 107)

        At the effective time, the board of directors of the combined company will consist of (a) nine directors designated by Strayer,
(b) J. Kevin Gilligan, Chief Executive Officer of Capella, and (c) two additional designees who are currently members of the
Capella board of directors and are recommended by Mr. Gilligan. In addition, one of the two additional Capella designees will be
appointed to serve on the Compensation Committee of the combined company.

        Robert Silberman will continue as Executive Chairman of the board of directors of the combined company and Mr. Gilligan
will be appointed as Vice Chairman at the effective time. Karl McDonnell, Strayer's current President and Chief Executive Officer,
and Daniel W. Jackson, Strayer's current Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will continue in their respective
positions at the combined company following the effective time. Steven L. Polacek, Capella's current Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer, will be appointed as the Chief Integration/Transition Officer of the combined company.

        On October 29, 2017, at a meeting of the Capella board of directors, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ("Morgan Stanley") rendered
its oral opinion to the Capella board of directors, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion, dated October 29, 2017,

Table of Contents

• the accuracy of each party's representations and warranties in the merger agreement (generally subject to a material
adverse effect standard) as of the date of the merger agreement and as of the closing date and the receipt by each
party of a certificate from an executive officer of the other party certifying that this condition has been satisfied; 

• the performance with all of the material covenants and agreements required to be performed by each party and the
receipt by each party of a certificate from an executive officer of the other party certifying that this condition has
been satisfied; 

• the absence of a material adverse effect on either party since the date of the merger agreement; and 

• the receipt by each party of (i) an opinion from its tax counsel, dated as of the closing date, to the effect that the
merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) a copy of a

        Capella and Strayer cannot be certain when, or if, the conditions to the merger agreement will be satisfied or waived (to the
extent waiver is permitted by applicable law), or when or whether the merger will be consummated.

No Solicitation (See Page 130)

        As more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and as set forth in the merger agreement, the merger
agreement restricts the ability of either Capella or Strayer to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or
induce, or take any other action that could reasonably be expected to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal which
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any competing acquisition proposal or (ii) subject to certain exceptions,
engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding any competing acquisition proposal. If, however, either Strayer or Capella, as
applicable, receives an unsolicited competing acquisition proposal from a third party, that, prior to receipt of shareholder approval
of the Capella Merger Proposal (in the case of Capella) or stockholder approval of the Strayer Required Proposals (in the case of
Strayer), such party's board of directors determines in good faith (after consultation with such party's financial advisors and outside
counsel) that such competing acquisition proposal is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in
"The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation") and that a failure to take certain actions would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties to Capella's shareholders (in the case of the Capella board of directors) or directors' duties to Strayer (in the case of
the Strayer board of directors), in each case under applicable law, then such party may, subject to specified conditions and
requirements, furnish nonpublic information to the person making the proposal and participate in discussions or negotiations with
such person. The board of directors of either Capella or Strayer may also withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify or amend, or publicly
propose to withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify or amend its approval or recommendation of the proposals described in this joint
proxy statement/ prospectus, subject to certain conditions, if such board first determines in good faith (after consultation with such
party's financial advisors and outside counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
duties to Capella's shareholders (in the case of the Capella board of directors) or directors' duties to Strayer (in the case of the
Strayer board of directors), in each case under applicable law.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (See Page 136)

        The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the consummation of the merger in any of the following ways:

• by mutual written consent of Capella and Strayer; or

• by either Capella or Strayer: if any law or final and non-appealable order shall have been issued by any
governmental entity of competent jurisdiction which permanently prohibits, restrains or makes illegal the
consummation of the merger; 

• if the merger has not been consummated by July 31, 2018, referred to as the "outside date," which will be
automatically extended to March 31, 2019 if, on the initial outside date, the only conditions under the merger
agreement that have not been satisfied or waived relate to antitrust or certain educational regulatory matters; 

• if, after completion of the Capella special meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof), the Capella
shareholders have not approved the Capella Merger Proposal; 

• if, after completion of the Strayer special meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof), the Strayer
stockholders have not approved the Strayer Required Proposals; 

• if the other party breaches any of its representations, warranties or covenants, which breach (A) is incapable of being
cured prior to the outside date or otherwise is not cured by the earlier of (x) twenty (20) business days following
written notice to such other party by the non-breaching party of such breach or (y) the business day prior to the
outside date and (B) would result in a failure of the related closing condition to be satisfied; 

• if the other party breaches in any material respect any of its non-solicitation obligations under the merger agreement;

• if the other party's board of directors has made a change of recommendation in favor of the Capella Merger Proposal
(in the case of the Capella board of directors) or the Strayer Required Proposals (in the case of the Strayer board of
directors); or 

• prior to the approval of the Capella Merger Proposal by Capella shareholders (in the case of the Capella board of
directors) or the approval of the Strayer Required Proposals by Strayer stockholders (in the case of the Strayer board
of directors), if the applicable party's board of directors determines to enter into a definitive agreement providing for
a Superior Proposal,so long as such party is permitted to do so pursuant to the non-solicitation obligations in the
merger agreement, and pays the required termination fee.

Termination Fees and Expenses (See Page 137)

        Upon termination of the merger agreement under certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, Strayer may be
required to pay Capella a termination fee of $25 million, and upon termination of the merger agreement under certain other
circumstances specified in the merger agreement, Capella may be required to pay Strayer a termination fee of $25 million. Upon
termination of the merger agreement in certain circumstances specified in the merger agreement, Strayer or Capella may be required
to reimburse the other party's transaction expenses up to $8 million, to be credited against the $25 million termination fee (if such
fee is subsequently required to be paid, as specified in the merger agreement).

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger (See Page 113)

        To consummate the merger, Capella and Strayer must obtain approvals or consents from, or make filings with, the FTC and the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ and certain educational regulatory bodies, as follows:

• Under the HSR Act, the merger cannot be consummated until, among other things, notifications have been given and
certain information has been provided to the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and all applicable waiting
periods have expired or been terminated. On November 22, 2017, the FTC granted early termination, effective

• The consummation of the merger is also subject to receipt of approvals or consents from certain educational
regulatory bodies, including approval from the DOE and the HLC, which is the institutional accreditor for Capella
University.

        These regulatory approvals are discussed under "The Merger—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger."

        Capella and Strayer have made or intend to make various filings and submissions for the above-referenced approvals and
consents. Capella and Strayer will seek to consummate the merger in the third quarter of 2018. Although Strayer and Capella
believe that they will be able to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals in a timely manner, they cannot be certain when or if they
will do so, or if any approvals will contain terms, conditions, or restrictions that will be detrimental to or adversely affect Strayer,
Capella, or their respective subsidiaries after the consummation of the merger.

Accounting Treatment (See Page 114)

        The combined company will account for the merger using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). GAAP requires that one of Capella or Strayer be designated as the
acquirer for accounting purposes. Based on the evidence available, Strayer will be treated as the acquiring entity for accounting
purposes. In identifying Strayer as the acquiring entity, the companies took into account the structure of the merger, the composition
of the combined company's board of directors and the designation of certain senior management positions of the combined
company, among others. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Strayer will become the historical financial statements of
the combined company.

        The combined company will measure Capella's assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values, including net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as of the consummation of the merger. Any excess of the
purchase price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill.

        Definite lived intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
and goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually. All intangible assets and goodwill are also
tested for impairment when certain indicators are present.

        The allocation of purchase price reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements is based on preliminary
estimates using assumptions Strayer management believes are reasonable based on currently available information. The final
purchase price and fair value assessment of assets and liabilities will be based in part on a detailed valuation that has not yet been
completed.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (See Page 116)

        It is a condition to Strayer's obligation to consummate the merger that Strayer receive an opinion from its tax counsel, dated as
of the closing date, to the effect that the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
It is a condition to Capella's obligation to consummate the merger that Capella receive an opinion from its tax counsel, dated as of
the closing date, to the effect that the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.
Based on the tax opinion representations and assumptions (as defined on page 117), in the opinion of the tax counsel of both Strayer
and Capella, the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

        Accordingly, a U.S. Holder (as defined on page 116) of Capella common stock will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S.
federal income tax purposes upon the exchange of shares of Capella common stock for shares of Strayer common stock in the
merger, except with respect to cash received by Capella shareholders in lieu of fractional shares. If any of the tax opinion
representations and assumptions is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated, the validity of the opinions described

above may be affected and the tax consequences of the merger could differ from those described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

        Please review the information set forth in the section entitled "Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" for a
more complete description of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Reverse Stock Split and of the
merger. Please consult your own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to you of the merger.

Interests of Capella's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (See Page 108)

        In considering the recommendation of the Capella board of directors, Capella shareholders should be aware that certain of
Capella's executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of the
Capella shareholders generally. These interests may present such executive officers and directors with actual or potential conflicts of
interest. The Capella board of directors was aware of these interests during its deliberations on the merits of the merger and in
deciding to recommend that Capella shareholders vote for the Capella Proposals. For additional information on the interests of
Capella's directors and officers in the merger, see "The Merger—Interests of Capella's Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger."

Interests of Strayer's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (See Page 113)

        In considering the recommendation of the Strayer board of directors, Strayer stockholders should be aware that certain of
Strayer's executive officers and directors have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Strayer's
stockholders generally. These interests may present such executive officers and directors with actual or potential conflicts of
interest. The Strayer board of directors was aware of these interests during its deliberations on the merits of the merger and in
deciding to recommend that Strayer stockholders vote for the Strayer Proposals. For additional information on the interests of
Strayer's directors and officers in the merger, see "The Merger—Interests of Strayer's Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger."

No Dissenters' Rights; No Appraisal Rights (See Page 120)

        Under Minnesota law and the Capella articles of incorporation, Capella shareholders will not be entitled to exercise any
dissenters' rights in connection with the merger.

        Under Maryland law, Strayer stockholders will not be entitled to exercise any appraisal rights in connection with the merger or
the Strayer Required Proposals.

Comparison of Stockholder Rights (See Page 158)

        As a result of the merger, the holders of shares of Capella common stock will become holders of combined company shares,
and their rights will be governed by Maryland law (instead of Minnesota law) and by the amended and restated charter and the
bylaws of the combined company (instead of the Capella articles of incorporation or the third amended and restated bylaws of
Capella (the "Capella bylaws")). Following the merger, former Capella shareholders will have different rights as combined company
stockholders than they had as Capella shareholders.

Risk Factors (See Page 35)

        In deciding how to vote your shares of Capella common stock or Strayer common stock, you should read carefully this entire
joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the documents incorporated by reference herein and the annexes and exhibits hereto,
and in particular, you should read the "Risk Factors" section beginning on page 35 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See

        "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Capella's Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q, which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, is hereby supplemented by the following
disclosure: On April 22, 2016, Capella acquired Hackbright Academy, a software engineering school for women headquartered in
San Francisco, California, for $18.0 million. On May 4, 2016, Capella acquired DevMountain, a software development school
headquartered in Provo, Utah, for $15.0 million. In connection with these acquisitions, Capella recorded $23.3 million of goodwill
and $7.9 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Since the dates of acquisition, Capella has made investments in both
businesses to position them for scalable growth. Hackbright and DevMountain have not achieved their revenue growth and
operating performance expectations and these trends are expected to continue. As a result, Capella believes it is increasingly likely
that some or all of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets associated with Hackbright and DevMountain will be impaired
in the future. Capella will assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of 2017 under
the quantitative impairment tests under ASC 350. See "Where You Can Find More Information" beginning on page 177.

SELECTED STRAYER AND CAPELLA UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL DATA 

        The following selected unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data (the "selected pro forma data") gives effect to
the merger. The selected unaudited pro forma combined statement of income data for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the
nine months ended September 30, 2017, gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred on January 1, 2016. The selected unaudited
pro forma combined balance sheet data as of September 30, 2017 gives effect to the merger as if it had occurred on September 30,
2017.

        The historical consolidated financial information has been adjusted in the selected pro forma data to give effect to pro forma
events that are (i) directly attributable to the merger, (ii) factually supportable and (iii) with respect to the statements of income,
expected to have a continuing impact on the combined company's results.

        The selected pro forma data has been derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed unaudited pro
forma combined financial information of the combined company appearing elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and
the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma combined financial information. In addition, the selected pro forma data was
based on, and should be read in conjunction with, the following historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes, which are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus:

• Separate historical consolidated financial statements of Strayer as of, and for the year ended and nine months ended,
December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively, and the related notes included in Strayer's Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and Strayer's Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2016; and 

• Separate historical consolidated financial statements of Capella as of, and for the year ended and nine months ended,
December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively, and the related notes included in Capella's Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and Capella's Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2016.

        The selected pro forma data has been prepared by Strayer using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with
GAAP. Strayer has been treated as the acquirer in the merger for accounting purposes. In the selected pro forma data, the assets and
liabilities of Capella have been recorded by Strayer at their respective fair values as of the date the merger is consummated. The
acquisition accounting is dependent upon certain valuation and other studies that have yet to commence or progress to a stage where
there is sufficient information for a definitive measurement. The assets and liabilities of Capella have been measured based on
various preliminary estimates using assumptions that Strayer believes are reasonable based on information that is currently available
to it. Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting will occur, and those differences could
have a material impact on the selected pro forma data. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the
purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements prepared in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the SEC.

        The selected pro form data has been presented for informational purposes only. The selected pro forma data does not purport to
represent the actual results of operations that Strayer and Capella would have achieved had the companies been combined during
the periods presented in the selected financial data and is not intended to project the future results of operations that the combined
company may achieve after the merger.

COMPARATIVE HISTORICAL AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA PER SHARE DATA 

        The following table reflects (a) the historical net income and book value per share of Strayer common stock in comparison
with the pro forma net income and book value per share after giving effect to the proposed merger as a purchase of Capella; (b) the
historical net income and book value per share of Capella common stock in comparison with the equivalent pro forma net income
and book value per share attributable to 875/1000ths of a share of Strayer common stock which will be received for each share of
Capella; and (c) the actual cash dividends per share compared in the case of Capella with the equivalent pro forma of 875/1000ths
of the cash dividend paid on each share of Strayer common stock.

        Historical Per Share Information of Strayer and Capella.    The historical per share information of each of Strayer and
Capella below is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of each of Strayer and Capella as of, and for the year
ended, December 31, 2016 and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of each of Strayer and Capella as of, and for the nine
months ended, September 30, 2017.

        Unaudited Pro Forma Combined per Share Data.    The unaudited pro forma combined per share data set forth below gives
effect to the merger under the acquisition method of accounting, as if the merger had been effective on January 1, 2016, the first
(1st) day of Strayer's fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, in the case of net income per share.

        The unaudited pro forma combined per share data is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of each of
Strayer and Capella as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2016, and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of each
of Strayer and Capella as of, and for the nine months ended, September 30, 2017.

        The acquisition method of accounting is based on Financial Accounting Standards Board, Accounting Standards Codification
("ASC") 805, Business Combinations, and uses the fair value concepts defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures, which Strayer has adopted as required. Acquisition accounting requires, among other things, that most assets acquired
and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Fair value measurements recorded in acquisition
accounting are dependent upon certain valuation studies of Capella's assets and liabilities and other studies that have yet to
commence or progress to a stage where there is sufficient information for a definitive measurement. Accordingly, the pro forma
adjustments reflect the assets and liabilities of Capella at their preliminary estimated fair values. Differences between these
preliminary estimates and the final values in acquisition accounting will occur and these differences could have a material impact on
the unaudited pro forma combined per share information set forth in the following table.

        The unaudited pro forma combined per share data does not purport to represent the actual results of operations that the
combined company would have achieved had the companies been combined during these periods or to project the future results of
operations that the combined company may achieve after consummation of the merger.

        Unaudited Equivalent Pro Forma per Share Data for Capella.    The unaudited equivalent pro forma per share data for
Capella set forth below is calculated by multiplying the corresponding unaudited pro forma combined per share data by the 0.875
merger exchange ratio.

        Generally.    You should read the below information in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial
information included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the historical consolidated financial statements of
Strayer and Capella and related notes that have been filed with the SEC, certain of which are incorporated by reference into this

RISK FACTORS 

        In addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including
the matters addressed under "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" of this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
Strayer stockholders should carefully consider the following risks in deciding whether to vote for the approval of the Strayer Proposals,
and Capella shareholders should carefully consider the following risks in deciding whether to vote for the approval of the Capella
Proposals. Descriptions of some of these risks can be found in the Annual Reports of Strayer and Capella on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2016, and any amendments thereto, as such risks may be updated or supplemented in each company's subsequently
filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K, which are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. You should read carefully this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus and its annexes and exhibits and the other
documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See also "Incorporation of Certain Documents by
Reference" and "Where You Can Find More Information."

Risks Related to the Merger 

Fluctuations in the market price of Strayer common stock will affect the value of the merger consideration.

        In the merger, each share of Capella common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time will be converted
into the right to receive 0.875 shares of Strayer common stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares). This merger exchange ratio will not
be adjusted in the event of any change in the market price of Strayer common stock or Capella common stock. Based on the closing price
per share of Strayer common stock on NASDAQ on December 6, 2017, the latest practicable date before the filing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the 0.875 of a combined company share that the holders of Capella common stock will hold after the merger in
respect of each share of Capella common stock they held immediately prior to the merger would have a value of approximately $83.58.

        The exact dollar value of the combined company shares that the Strayer stockholders and the Capella shareholders will hold upon
consummation of the merger will not be known at the time of the Strayer special meeting or the Capella special meeting and may be
greater than, the same as or less than the current prices at the time of the Strayer special meeting or the Capella special meeting. The
market price of the Strayer common stock is subject to general price fluctuations in the market for publicly traded equity securities and has
experienced volatility in the past. As a result of these fluctuations, the value of the merger consideration will also vary. For example, based
on the range of closing prices of Strayer common stock during the period from October 27, 2017, the last trading day before public
announcement of the merger, through December 6, 2017, the latest practicable trading date before the filing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, the merger exchange ratio represented a value ranging from a low of $80.26 to a high of $87.50 for each share of
Capella common stock.

        Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in the respective
businesses, operations and prospects of Capella and Strayer, regulatory considerations and other factors beyond the control of Capella or
Strayer. You should obtain current market price quotations for shares of Capella common stock and for shares of Strayer common stock,
but as indicated above, the prices at the time the merger is consummated may be greater than, the same as or less than such price
quotations.

The market price for the combined company shares following the consummation of the merger may be affected by factors different
from or in addition to those that historically have affected or currently affect shares of Capella common stock and/or shares of Strayer
common stock.

        Upon consummation of the merger, holders of Capella common stock and holders of Strayer common stock immediately prior to the
consummation of the merger will both hold combined company shares. Although the two companies operate in the same industry, Strayer's
businesses differ from those

of Capella, and accordingly the results of operations of the combined company will be affected by some factors that are different from or
in addition to those currently affecting the results of operations of Capella and those currently affecting the results of operations of Strayer.
For a discussion of the businesses of Capella and Strayer and of some important factors to consider in connection with those businesses,
see the documents incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and referred to under "Incorporation of Certain
Documents by Reference" and "Where You Can Find More Information."

The merger may not be consummated unless important conditions are satisfied or waived.

        The merger agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by applicable law) to
consummate the merger. Those conditions include, among others:

• approval of the Capella Merger Proposal by the Capella shareholders; 

• approval of the Strayer Required Proposals by the Strayer stockholders; 

• approval for listing on NASDAQ of the combined company shares to be issued to Capella shareholders in connection with
the merger, subject to official notice of issuance; 

• receipt of the requisite regulatory and antitrust approvals, including approvals of certain education regulatory agencies; 

• the absence of any law or order prohibiting the merger; and 

• the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part.

        These conditions to the consummation of the merger may not be satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by applicable law) and,
as a result, the merger may not be consummated at the time expected, or at all. For additional information regarding the conditions to the
merger, see "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Consummation of the Merger."

        In addition, Capella or Strayer may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances See "The Merger
Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement."

The merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of either Capella or Strayer.

        The merger agreement contains "no shop" provisions that restrict each of Strayer's and Capella's ability to solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage and induce, or take any other action designed to facilitate competing third-party proposals relating to a merger,
reorganization or consolidation of the company or an acquisition of the company's stock or assets. Further, subject to the parties' rights to
terminate the merger agreement, each party has agreed to submit the merger in the manner described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus to a vote of its stockholders for approval notwithstanding any change in recommendation by its board of directors. In
addition, the other party generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the merger in response to any competing acquisition
proposals before the board of directors of the company that has received a third-party proposal may withdraw or qualify its
recommendation with respect to the merger. If the merger agreement is terminated in connection with the pursuit of a third-party
transaction by one of the parties, that party will be required to pay a termination fee of $25 million to the other party. See "The Merger
Agreement—No Solicitation" beginning on page 130, "The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement" beginning on page
136 and "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses" beginning on page 137.

        These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion
of Strayer or Capella from considering or proposing that

acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to
be received or realized in the merger. A potential third-party acquirer maintaining interest in the face of these provisions might propose to
pay a lower price to the stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the $25 million
termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.

        If the merger agreement is terminated and either Strayer or Capella determines to seek another business combination, it may not be
able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the merger.

The pendency of the merger could materially adversely affect the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of
Capella or Strayer.

        Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees, suppliers, students and employers of students may have an adverse effect on
Capella and Strayer. Some students and others who deal with Capella and/or Strayer may seek to change existing relationships with
Capella and/or Strayer or delay decisions to continue or expand their relationships with the companies. Current and prospective employees
may experience uncertainty about their future roles, which may affect Capella's or Strayer's ability to attract, retain and motivate key
personnel. If employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the
businesses, the combined company following the merger could face disruptions in its operations, loss of existing students, loss of key
information, expertise or know-how, and unanticipated additional recruitment and training costs. In addition, the loss of key personnel
could diminish the anticipated benefits of the merger.

        In addition, the merger agreement restricts Strayer and Capella from taking certain actions until the effective time without the consent
of the other party, including, among others: the payment of dividends; the issuance of equity (including incentive equity awards); certain
increases to employee compensation and benefits; capital expenditures; the incurrence of indebtedness; acquisitions and divestitures; and
the entry into or amending certain material contracts. Strayer and Capella are required to conduct business in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice. The restrictive covenants, which are subject to various specific exceptions, may prevent Strayer or Capella
from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the merger. For a description of the restrictive
covenants applicable to Strayer and Capella, see "The Merger Agreement—Conduct of Business Pending the Merger."

Litigation filed or that may be filed against Capella, Strayer, Merger Sub and/or the members of the Capella board of directors or the
Strayer board of directors could prevent or delay the consummation of the merger.

        A putative class action lawsuit has been filed by a Capella shareholder challenging the disclosures made in connection with the
merger. The lawsuit seeks to enjoin the merger, to recover damages if the merger is consummated, attorney's fees, and other relief. For a
more detailed description of litigation in connection with the merger, see "The Merger—Litigation Relating to the Merger" beginning on
page 115.

        The outcome of this lawsuit or any other lawsuit that may be filed challenging the merger is uncertain. One of the conditions to the
closing of the merger is that no governmental authority has issued or entered any order after the date of the merger agreement having the
effect of enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger, and this lawsuit seeks and potential other lawsuits may seek
an order enjoining consummation of the merger. Accordingly, if this lawsuit or any future lawsuit is successful in obtaining an order
enjoining consummation of the merger, then such order may prevent the merger from being consummated, or from being consummated
within the expected time frame, and could result in substantial costs to Capella and Strayer including, but not limited to, costs associated
with the indemnification of directors and officers. Any such injunction or delay in the merger being completed may adversely affect
Capella's and Strayer's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Table of Contents

Capella and Strayer directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the
interests of Capella shareholders and Strayer stockholders.

        Certain of the directors and executive officers of Capella and Strayer negotiated the terms of the merger agreement and the Capella
and Strayer directors and executive officers have interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of Capella
shareholders and Strayer stockholders, respectively. These interests include, but are not limited to, the continued service of certain
directors and officers of Capella and Strayer as directors and officers of the combined company, the treatment in the merger of Capella
stock options and Capella RSUs and certain other executive compensation arrangements with the Capella directors and officers, and
provisions in the merger agreement regarding continued indemnification of and advancement of expenses to Capella and Strayer directors
and officers. Capella shareholders and Strayer stockholders should be aware of these interests when they consider their respective boards
of directors' recommendation that they vote in favor of the merger-related proposals.

        The members of the Capella board of directors were aware of and considered these interests relating to Capella, among other matters,
in evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending that Capella shareholders approve the Capella Proposals. The
interests of Capella directors and executive officers are described under "The Merger—Interests of Capella's Directors and Executive
Officers in the Merger."

        The members of the Strayer board of directors were aware of and considered these interests relating to Strayer, among other matters,
in evaluating the merger agreement and the merger, and in recommending that Strayer stockholders approve the Strayer Proposals. The
interests of Strayer directors and executive officers are described in more detail under "The Merger—Interests of Strayer's Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger."

Strayer stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in the combined company after the merger and will exercise
less influence over management.

        Strayer stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the Strayer board of directors and on other matters affecting
Strayer. Upon consummation of the merger, each Strayer stockholder will be a stockholder of the combined company with a percentage
ownership of the combined company that is smaller than the stockholder's prior percentage ownership of Strayer. After consummation of
the merger, Strayer stockholders are expected to own approximately 52% of the issued and outstanding combined company shares on a
fully diluted basis. Because of this, Strayer stockholders will have less influence on the management and policies of the combined
company than they now have on the management and policies of Strayer.

Capella shareholders will receive combined company shares as a result of the merger, which have different rights from shares of
Capella common stock.

        Upon consummation of the merger, the rights of former Capella shareholders who receive combined company shares will be
governed by Maryland law (including the Maryland General Corporation Law, the "MGCL"), the amended and restated Strayer charter
and the Strayer bylaws, which differ from Minnesota law (including the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, the "MBCA") and the
Capella articles of incorporation and the Capella bylaws. The rights associated with shares of Capella common stock are different from the
rights associated with combined company shares. For a discussion of the different rights associated with shares of Capella common stock
and combined company shares, see "Comparison of Stockholder Rights."

Table of Contents

Following the consummation of the merger, the composition of the combined company board of directors and the management team
will be different from the composition of the current board of directors and management teams of Strayer and Capella, which may
affect the strategy and operations of the combined company.

        Following the consummation of the merger, the board of directors of the combined company will consist of (a) nine directors
designated by Strayer, (b) J. Kevin Gilligan, Chief Executive Officer of Capella, and (c) two additional designees who are currently
members of the Capella board of directors and are recommended by Mr. Gilligan. In addition, one of the two additional Capella designees
will be appointed to serve on the Compensation Committee of the combined company.

        Robert Silberman will continue as Executive Chairman of the board of directors of the combined company and Mr. Gilligan will be
appointed as Vice Chairman at the effective time. Karl McDonnell, Strayer's current President and Chief Executive Officer, and Daniel W.
Jackson, Strayer's current Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will continue in their respective positions at the combined
company following the effective time. Steven L. Polacek, Capella's current Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will be
appointed as the Chief Integration/Transition Officer of the combined company.

        This new composition of the board of directors and management team may affect the combined company's business strategy and
operating decisions following the consummation of the merger, as compared to those of Strayer and Capella prior to the merger. In
addition, there can be no assurances that the new board of directors and management team will function effectively as a team and that any
differences or difficulties, should they arise, will not have an adverse effect on the combined company's business or results.

The opinions of Capella's and Strayer's financial advisors do not reflect changes in circumstances that may have occurred or that may
occur between the signing of the merger agreement and the consummation of the merger.

        The opinion rendered to the Capella board of directors by Morgan Stanley and the opinion rendered to the Strayer board of directors
by Perella Weinberg were provided in connection with, and at the time of, the boards of directors' respective evaluation of the merger.
These opinions were based on the respective financial analyses performed, which considered market and other conditions then in effect,
and financial forecasts and other information made available to them, as of the date of their respective opinions, which may have changed,
or may change, after the date of the opinions. Neither the Capella board of directors nor the Strayer board of directors has obtained
updated opinions from their respective financial advisors as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus or as of any other date, nor
will either receive updated, revised or reaffirmed opinions prior to the consummation of the merger. Changes in the operations and
prospects of Capella or Strayer, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of Capella or
Strayer, and which changes were not taken into account by Capella's and Strayer's financial advisors in rendering their opinions, may
significantly alter the value of Capella or Strayer or the prices of the Capella common stock or the Strayer common stock by the time the
merger is consummated. The opinions do not speak as of the time the merger will be consummated or as of any date other than the date of
such opinions. Because Capella's and Strayer's financial advisors will not be updating their opinions, the opinions do not address the
fairness of the merger consideration, from a financial point of view, at any time other than the time such opinions were issued, even though
the Capella board of directors' recommendation that Capella shareholders vote "FOR" the Capella Proposals and the Strayer board of
directors' recommendation that Strayer stockholders vote "FOR" the Strayer Proposals are made as of the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. For a description of the opinions that the Capella board of directors and the Strayer board of directors received from
their respective financial advisors, see "The Merger—Opinion of Capella's Financial Advisor" and "The Merger—Opinion of Strayer's
Financial Advisor."

Failure to consummate the merger could negatively impact respective future stock prices, operations and financial results of Capella
and Strayer.

        If the merger is not consummated for any reason, Capella and Strayer may be subjected to a number of material risks, including the
following:

• a possible decline in the market prices of Capella common stock or Strayer common stock to the extent that their current
market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be consummated and will be beneficial to the value of the
business of the combined company; 

• having to pay certain costs related to the proposed merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, printing and
mailing fees, which must be paid regardless of whether the merger is consummated; 

• addressing any loss of personnel and/or students that may have occurred since the announcement of the signing of the
merger agreement, as a result of uncertainty regarding the employee or student relationship with the combined company; 

• addressing the consequences of operational decisions made since the signing of the merger agreement either because of
restrictions on Capella's or Strayer's operations imposed by the terms of the merger agreement, including decisions to delay
or defer capital expenditures; 

• returning the focus of management and personnel to operating Capella or Strayer, as applicable, on a stand-alone basis,
without any of the benefits expected to have been provided by the consummation of the merger; and 

• negative reactions from their respective stockholders, students, suppliers and employees.

        In addition to the above risks, Capella or Strayer may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay a termination fee of up to
$25 million to the other party, and in some cases reimburse the other party's expenses up to $8 million, which may materially adversely
affect Capella's or Strayer's financial condition, as applicable.

        If the merger is not consummated, we cannot assure the Strayer stockholders or the Capella shareholders that these risks will not
materialize and will not materially adversely affect the business, financial results and stock price of the respective companies. Failure to
consummate the merger could also materially adversely affect the stock prices of Capella and Strayer to the extent the current market
prices reflect a market premium based on the assumption that the merger will be consummated and will be beneficial to the value of the
business of the combined company.

Capella shareholders and Strayer stockholders will not be entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights in the merger.

        Dissenters' or appraisal rights are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable shareholders and stockholders to dissent from a
transaction, such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial
proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to stockholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction.

        Under the MBCA, shareholders do not have dissenters' rights if the shares of stock they hold at the record date for determination of
shareholders entitled to notice of the shareholders meeting at which shareholders are to vote on the proposed corporate action are listed on
the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ Global Market, or the NASDAQ Global Select Market,
except if the shareholders are required to accept for such shares anything other than shares, or cash in lieu of fractional shares, of any class
or any series of shares, or any other ownership interest, of any other organization which is similarly listed on the abovementioned national
securities markets at the time the corporate action becomes effective. As the shares of Capella common stock are listed on the NASDAQ
Global Select Market and are expected to continue to be so listed on the Capella record date, and as the Capella shareholders will receive
as merger consideration combined company shares that will be listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and cash in lieu of fractional
shares, Capella

shareholders will not be entitled to dissenters' rights in the merger with respect to their shares of Capella common stock.

        None of the merger of Merger Sub with and into Capella, the issuance of Strayer common stock in the merger or the amendment and
restatement of the Strayer charter gives rise to appraisal rights for the Strayer stockholders under Maryland law. Strayer stockholders will
not be entitled to dissenters' or appraisal rights in the merger with respect to their shares of Strayer common stock.

Financial projections regarding Capella and Strayer may not prove accurate.

        In connection with the merger, Capella and Strayer prepared and considered internal financial forecasts for Capella and Strayer. These
financial projections include assumptions regarding future operating cash flows, expenditures and income of Capella and Strayer. These
financial projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure, are subject to significant economic, competitive, industry and
other uncertainties and may not be achieved in full, at all, or within projected timeframes. The failure of Capella or Strayer to achieve
projected results could have a material adverse effect on the price of the combined company shares, the combined company's financial
position, and the combined company's ability to pay dividends, and/or pay dividends at or above the rate currently paid by Strayer or
Capella, following the consummation of the merger.

The merger may disrupt attention of Capella's and Strayer's management from ongoing business operations.

        Each of Capella and Strayer has expended, and expects to continue to expend, significant management resources to consummate the
merger. The attention of each company's management may be diverted away from the day-to-day operations of the businesses of Capella
and Strayer, respectively, including implementing initiatives to improve performance and execution of existing business plans in an effort
to consummate the merger. This diversion of management resources could disrupt Capella's or Strayer's operations and may have an
adverse effect on the respective businesses, financial conditions and results of operations of the two companies or the combined company.

The consummation of the merger is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from government and regulatory entities, which
may impose conditions that could have a material adverse effect on Capella or Strayer or could cause either Capella or Strayer to
abandon the merger.

        The governmental and regulatory agencies from which Capella and Strayer will seek approvals have broad discretion in administering
the applicable government regulations. Capella and Strayer are unable to consummate the merger until after the applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act expires or terminates. On November 22, 2017, the FTC granted early termination, effective immediately, of the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.

        Regulatory approvals will also be required in connection with the merger from certain educational agencies, including approval from
the HLC. In addition, Strayer is notifying all of the educational regulatory agencies that approve Strayer University of the merger.
Although it is not expected that this merger constitutes a change of control for Strayer University, it is possible that some of those agencies
may require approval of the merger, or subject Strayer University to a review in connection with the merger.

        In addition, as a condition of the merger, Capella must receive from the DOE a written response to its preacquisition review
application that does not indicate the existence of any impediment to the issuance of the temporary provisional program participation
agreement following consummation of the merger that would reasonably be expected to result in a combined company material adverse
effect, or any terms or conditions that would reasonably be expected to result in a combined company material adverse effect, as described
in the merger agreement. See "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Consummation of the Merger" beginning on page 121.

        There can be no assurance that all of the regulatory approvals described above, or any other regulatory approvals that might be
required to consummate the merger, will be obtained and, if obtained, there can be no assurance as to the timing of any approvals, the
ability to obtain the

approvals on satisfactory terms, or that the conditions will not result in the abandonment of the merger. See the sections of this proxy
statement/prospectus entitled "The Merger—Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger" beginning on page 113 and "The Merger
Agreement—Conditions to Consummation of the Merger" beginning on page 121.

        The merger agreement may require Strayer and Capella to accept conditions from certain regulators that could limit the combined
company after the consummation of the merger without either of Strayer or Capella having the right to refuse to consummate the merger
on the basis of those regulatory conditions, except that for certain education regulators, Strayer and Capella may refuse to consummate the
merger if any such conditions individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the
combined company following the consummation of the merger.

        Any delay in the consummation of the merger for regulatory reasons could diminish the anticipated benefits of the merger or result in
additional transaction costs. Any uncertainty over the ability to consummate the merger could make it more difficult for Capella or Strayer
to maintain or pursue particular business strategies. Conditions imposed by regulatory agencies in connection with their approval of the
merger may restrict the combined company's ability to modify its operations or the combined company's ability to expend cash for other
uses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on, or delay, the anticipated benefits of the merger.

The merger may not be accretive and may cause dilution to the combined company's earnings per share, which may negatively affect
the market price of the combined company shares.

        Because shares of Strayer common stock will be issued in the merger, it is possible that, although Capella and Strayer currently
expect the merger to be accretive to earnings per share in 2019, excluding one-time charges, the merger may be dilutive to earnings per
share, which could negatively affect the market price of combined company shares.

        In connection with the consummation of the merger, Strayer expects to issue approximately 10.5 million shares of Strayer common
stock. The issuance of these new shares of Strayer common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price of shares of Strayer
common stock (referred to as combined company shares as of the consummation of and following the merger) through dilution of earnings
per share or otherwise.

        In addition, future events and conditions could increase the dilution that is currently projected, including adverse changes in market
conditions, additional transaction and integration related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of the benefits
anticipated in the merger. Any dilution of, or delay in any accretion to, earnings per share could cause the price of the combined company
shares to decline or grow at a reduced rate.

Risks Related to the Business of the Combined Company 

Combining the two companies may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the combined company may not
realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger.

        Capella and Strayer have operated and, until the consummation of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of
the merger will depend on, among other things, the combined company's ability to combine the businesses of Capella and Strayer in a
manner that does not materially disrupt the existing student relationships of either Capella or Strayer or adversely affect current revenues
and investments in future growth. Additionally, the combined company may not be able to successfully achieve the level of cost savings,
revenue enhancements and synergies that it expects. If the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the
anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.

Table of Contents

        In addition, the continued operation of two independent businesses within the combined company may be a complex, costly and time-
consuming process. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:

• the diversion of management attention to integration matters; 

• difficulties in integrating functions, personnel and systems; 

• challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and
compensation structures between the two companies; 

• difficulties in assimilating employees and in attracting and retaining key personnel; 

• challenges in keeping existing students and enrolling new students; 

• difficulties in maintaining consistency in educational programs across platforms; 

• challenges related to maintaining accreditations with multiple accreditors and working with multiple oversight bodies; 

• difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the
combination; 

• difficulties in managing multiple brands under a significantly larger and more complex company; 

• difficulties operating Strayer University and Capella University as separate legal entities; 

• contingent liabilities that are larger than expected; and 

• potential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger.

        Many of these factors are outside the control of Capella and Strayer and/or will be outside the control of the combined company, and
any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased expected revenues and diversion of management time and energy, which could
materially impact the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. In addition, even if the businesses
of Capella and Strayer are operated successfully within the combined company, the full anticipated benefits of the merger may not be
realized, including the expected synergies. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further,
additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in operating the businesses of Capella and Strayer. All of these factors could cause dilution
to the earnings per share of the combined company, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and negatively impact the
price of the combined company shares. As a result, it cannot be assured that the combined company will realize the full benefits
anticipated from the merger within the anticipated time frames, or at all.

Capella and Strayer will incur substantial direct and indirect costs as a result of the merger.

        Capella and Strayer will incur substantial expenses in connection with and as a result of consummating the merger, and over a period
of time following the consummation of the merger, the combined company also expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with
coordinating and, in certain cases, combining the businesses, operations, policies and procedures of Capella and Strayer. A portion of the
transaction costs related to the merger will be incurred regardless of whether the merger is consummated. While Capella and Strayer have
assumed that a certain level of transaction expenses will be incurred, factors beyond Capella's and Strayer's control could affect the total
amount or the timing of these expenses. Although many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate
accurately, the current estimate of the aggregate expenses that will be incurred by Capella and Strayer is approximately $38 million, which
is subject to change. These expenses may exceed the costs historically borne by Capella and Strayer. These costs could adversely affect the
financial condition and results of operations of Capella and Strayer prior to the merger and of the combined company following the
consummation of the merger.

The combined company's actual financial position and results of operations may differ materially from the unaudited pro forma
financial data included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        The pro forma financial information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is presented for informational purposes only
and may not be an indication of what the combined company's financial position or results of operations would have been had the merger
been consummated on the dates indicated. The pro forma financial information has been derived from the audited and unaudited historical
financial statements of Strayer and Capella and certain adjustments and assumptions regarding the combined company after giving effect
to the merger. The assets and liabilities of Capella have been measured at fair value based on various preliminary estimates using
assumptions that Strayer management believes are reasonable utilizing information currently available. The process for estimating the fair
value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires the use of judgment in determining the appropriate assumptions and estimates.
These estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. Differences
between preliminary estimates in the pro forma financial information and the final acquisition accounting will occur and could have a
material impact on the pro forma financial information and the combined company's financial position and future results of operations.

        In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial information may not prove to be accurate, and other factors
may affect the combined company's financial condition or results of operations following the consummation of the merger. Any material
variance from the pro forma financial information may cause significant variations in the market price of the combined company shares.
See "Strayer and Capella Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements."

The combined company is expected to record a significant amount of goodwill as a result of the merger, and such goodwill could
become impaired in the future.

        Accounting standards in the United States require that one party to the merger be identified as the acquirer. In accordance with these
standards, the merger will be accounted for as an acquisition of Capella common stock by Strayer and will follow the acquisition method
of accounting for business combinations. The Strayer assets and liabilities will be consolidated with those of Capella on Strayer's financial
statements. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of Capella's assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill.

        The combined company will be required to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually. To the extent goodwill becomes
impaired, the combined company may be required to incur material charges relating to such impairment. Such a potential impairment
charge could have a material impact on future operating results and statements of financial position of the combined company.

THE CAPELLA SPECIAL MEETING 

Date, Time and Place of the Capella Special Meeting 

        The Capella special meeting will be held at 8:00 a.m. local time, on January 19, 2018, at Capella's corporate headquarters located at
Capella Tower, 225 South Sixth Street, 3rd Floor, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402. On or about December 14, 2017, Capella commenced
mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the enclosed form of proxy card to its shareholders entitled to vote at the Capella special
meeting.

Purpose of the Capella Special Meeting 

        At the Capella special meeting, Capella shareholders will be asked to consider and vote upon the following proposals:

1. the Capella Merger Proposal; 

2. the Capella Adjournment Proposal; and 

3. the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal.

        The Capella board of directors is not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the Capella special meeting.

Recommendation of the Capella Board of Directors 

        The Capella board of directors recommends that the Capella shareholders vote "FOR" the Capella Merger Proposal, "FOR" the
Capella Adjournment Proposal and "FOR" the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal. See "The Merger—Capella's Reasons for the
Merger; Recommendation of the Capella Board of Directors."

        Consummation of the merger is conditioned on approval of the Capella Merger Proposal, but is not conditioned on the approval of the
Capella Adjournment Proposal or the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal.

Capella Record Date and Quorum 

Record Date

        The Capella board of directors has fixed the close of business on December 11, 2017 as the record date for determining the Capella
shareholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Capella special meeting.

        As of December 6, 2017, the latest practicable date before the filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, there were 11,623,793
shares of Capella common stock outstanding held by 21 holders of record. Each share of Capella common stock entitles the holder to one
vote on each proposal to be considered at the Capella special meeting.

Quorum

        The presence of the Capella shareholders representing a majority of the shares of Capella common stock issued and outstanding on
the Capella record date and entitled to vote at the Capella special meeting, in person or represented by proxy, is necessary to constitute a
quorum.

        Abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum. Because all proposals to be voted on at the Capella
special meeting will be "non-routine" matters, we do not expect to receive any broker non-votes (which are shares of Capella common
stock held by banks, brokers or other nominees that are present in person or by proxy at the Capella special meeting but

with respect to which the bank, broker or other nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares how to vote on a particular
proposal and the bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal) and, if you do not provide
voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, your shares will not be counted as present for purposes of determining a
quorum.

Required Vote 

        Approval of the Capella Merger Proposal is required for consummation of the merger. Neither the approval of the Capella
Adjournment Proposal nor the approval of the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal is required for consummation of the merger.

Required Vote to Approve the Capella Merger Proposal

        Approval of the Capella Merger Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all shares of
Capella common stock entitled to vote at the Capella special meeting.

Required Vote to Approve the Capella Adjournment Proposal

        Approval of the Capella Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of (1) a majority of the
voting power of the shares present and entitled to vote on that item of business, or (2) a majority of the voting power of the minimum
number of the shares entitled to vote that would constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the meeting.

Required Vote to Approve the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal

        Approval of the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal on a non-binding, advisory basis requires that the votes cast "FOR" the
Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal are of a number greater than the votes cast "AGAINST" the Capella Advisory Compensation
Proposal.

Treatment of Abstentions; Failure to Vote 

        For purposes of the Capella special meeting, an abstention occurs when a Capella shareholder returns a proxy marked "ABSTAIN."
An abstention also occurs when a Capella shareholder attends the Capella special meeting and does not vote.

• For the Capella Merger Proposal, an abstention or a failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote cast "AGAINST"
this proposal. 

• For the Capella Adjournment Proposal, an abstention will have the same effect as a vote cast "AGAINST" this proposal. If
a Capella shareholder fails to vote or to instruct his or her bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote and is not present
in person or by proxy at the Capella special meeting, it will have no effect on the vote count for the Capella Adjournment
Proposal. 

• For the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal, an abstention will not have any effect on the outcome of this proposal. If
a Capella shareholder fails to vote or to instruct his or her bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote and is not present
in person or by proxy at the Capella special meeting, it will also have no effect on the vote count for the Capella Advisory
Compensation Proposal.

Voting by Capella's Directors and Executive Officers 

        As of December 6, 2017, the latest practicable date before the filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, directors and executive
officers of Capella and their affiliates owned and were entitled to

vote 258,694 shares of Capella common stock, representing approximately 2.21% of the shares of Capella common stock outstanding on
that date, and directors and executive officers of Strayer did not have voting or dispositive power over any shares of Capella common
stock on that date. Capella currently expects that Capella's directors and executive officers will vote their shares of Capella common stock
in favor of the Capella Proposals, although none of them has entered into any agreement obligating him or her to do so.

Voting of Proxies; Incomplete Proxies 

        Giving a proxy means that a Capella shareholder authorizes the persons named in the enclosed proxy card to vote its shares at the
Capella special meeting in the manner it directs. A Capella shareholder may vote by proxy or in person at the Capella special meeting. If
you hold your shares of Capella common stock in your name as a shareholder of record, to submit a proxy, you, as a Capella shareholder,
may use one of the following methods:

• By Internet.  The web address and instructions for Internet proxy submission can be found on the enclosed proxy card. You
will be required to provide your assigned control number located on the proxy card. Internet proxy submission via the web
address indicated on the enclosed proxy card is available 24 hours a day. If you choose to submit your proxy by Internet,
then you do not need to return the proxy card. To be valid, your Internet proxy must be received by 11:59 p.m. (U.S.
Eastern Time) on the day preceding the Capella special meeting. 

• By Telephone.  The toll-free number for telephone proxy submission can be found on the enclosed proxy card. You will be
required to provide your assigned control number located on the proxy card. Telephone proxy submission is available
24 hours a day. If you choose to submit your proxy by telephone, then you do not need to return the proxy card. To be
valid, your telephone proxy must be received by 11:59 p.m. (U.S. Eastern Time) on the day preceding the Capella special
meeting. 

• By Mail.  Mark the enclosed proxy card, sign and date it, and return it in the postage-paid envelope you have been
provided. To be valid, your proxy by mail must be received by 11:59 p.m. (U.S. Eastern Time) on the day preceding the
Capella special meeting.

        You may also vote your shares in person at the Capella special meeting.

        Capella requests that Capella shareholders submit their proxies over the Internet, by telephone or by completing and signing the
accompanying proxy card and returning it to Capella in the enclosed postage-paid envelope as soon as possible. When the accompanying
proxy card is returned properly executed, the shares of Capella common stock represented by it will be voted at the Capella special
meeting in accordance with the instructions contained on the proxy card.

        If you sign and return your proxy or voting instruction card without indicating how to vote on any particular proposal, the shares of
Capella common stock represented by your proxy will be voted "FOR" each such proposal in accordance with the recommendation of the
Capella board of directors. Unless you check the box on your proxy card to withhold discretionary authority, the proxyholders may use
their discretion to vote on the proposals relating to the Capella special meeting.

        If your shares of Capella common stock are held in "street name" by a bank, broker or other nominee, you should check the voting
form used by that firm to determine whether you may give voting instructions by telephone or over the Internet.

        EVERY CAPELLA SHAREHOLDER'S VOTE IS IMPORTANT. ACCORDINGLY, EACH CAPELLA SHAREHOLDER
SHOULD SUBMIT ITS PROXY VIA THE INTERNET OR BY TELEPHONE, OR SIGN, DATE AND RETURN THE
ENCLOSED PROXY CARD, WHETHER OR

NOT THE CAPELLA SHAREHOLDER PLANS TO ATTEND THE CAPELLA SPECIAL MEETING IN PERSON.

Shares Held in Street Name and Broker Non-Votes 

        If your shares of Capella common stock are held in "street name" through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must instruct such
bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote the shares by following the instructions that the bank, broker or other nominee provides you
along with this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Your bank, broker or other nominee, as applicable, may have an earlier deadline by
which you must provide instructions to it as to how to vote your shares of Capella common stock, so you should read carefully the
materials provided to you by your bank, broker or other nominee.

        You are not permitted to vote shares held in "street name" by returning a proxy card directly to Capella or by voting in person at the
Capella special meeting unless you provide a "legal proxy," which you must obtain from your broker, bank or other nominee. Further,
banks, brokers or other nominees who hold shares of Capella common stock on behalf of their customers may not give a proxy to Capella
to vote those shares with respect to any of the Capella Proposals without specific instructions from their customers, as banks, brokers and
other nominees do not have discretionary voting power on any of the Capella Proposals. Therefore, if your shares of Capella common
stock are held in "street name" and you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote your shares:

1. your bank, broker or other nominee will not be permitted to vote your shares on the Capella Merger Proposal, and this non-
vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" this proposal; 

2. your bank, broker or other nominee will not be permitted to vote your shares on the Capella Adjournment Proposal, and
this non-vote will have no effect on the vote count for this proposal; and 

3. your bank, broker or other nominee will not be permitted to vote your shares on the Capella Advisory Compensation
Proposal, which will have no effect on the vote count for this proposal.

        If your shares of Capella common stock are held in "street name" and you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee on how
to vote your shares with respect to any of the Capella Proposals, your shares will not be counted toward determining whether a quorum is
present. Your shares will be counted toward determining whether a quorum is present if you instruct your bank, broker or other nominee
on how to vote your shares with respect to one or more of the Capella Proposals.

Revocability of Proxies and Changes to a Capella Shareholder's Vote 

        If you are a shareholder of record of Capella common stock, you may revoke or change your proxy at any time before it is voted at
the Capella special meeting by:

• sending a written notice of revocation to the Capella Corporate Secretary, at Capella's corporate headquarters, Capella
Tower, 225 South Sixth Street, 9th Floor, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402, that is received by Capella prior to 11:59 p.m.
(U.S. Eastern Time) on the day preceding the Capella special meeting, stating that you would like to revoke your proxy; 

• submitting a new proxy bearing a later date (by Internet, telephone or mail) that is received by Capella prior to 11:59 p.m.
(U.S. Eastern Time) on the day preceding the Capella special meeting; or 

• attending the Capella special meeting, providing a written notice of revocation and voting in person.

Table of Contents

        If you are a Capella shareholder whose shares are held in "street name" by a bank, broker or other nominee, you may revoke your
proxy or voting instructions and vote your shares in person at the Capella special meeting only in accordance with applicable rules and
procedures as employed by your bank, broker or other nominee. If your shares are held in an account at a bank, broker or other nominee,
you must follow the directions you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee in order to change or revoke your proxy or voting
instructions and should contact your bank, broker or other nominee to do so.

        Attending the Capella special meeting will NOT automatically revoke a proxy that was submitted through the Internet or by telephone
or mail. You must provide a written notice of revocation and vote by ballot at the Capella special meeting to change your vote.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        The cost of the solicitation of proxies from Capella shareholders will be borne by Capella. Capella will reimburse brokerage firms
and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable expenses incurred by them in sending proxy materials to the beneficial
owners of shares of Capella common stock. Capella has retained the professional proxy solicitation firm, Innisfree, to assist in the
solicitation of proxies for a base fee of $15,000 plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. In addition to solicitations by mail, Capella's
directors, officers and regular employees may solicit proxies personally or by telephone without additional compensation.

Attending the Capella Special Meeting 

        Subject to space availability and certain security procedures, all Capella shareholders as of the Capella record date, or their duly
appointed proxies, may attend the Capella special meeting. Admission to the Capella special meeting will be on a first-come, first-served
basis.

        Each person attending the Capella special meeting must have proof of ownership of shares of Capella common stock, as well as a
valid government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport, to be admitted to the meeting. If you hold your shares
of Capella common stock in your name as a shareholder of record, you will need proof of ownership of shares of Capella common stock.
If your shares of Capella common stock are held in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee and you plan to attend the Capella special
meeting, you must present proof of your ownership of shares Capella common stock, such as a bank or brokerage account statement, to be
admitted to the meeting.

CAPELLA PROPOSALS 

Capella Proposal 1: The Capella Merger Proposal 

        Capella shareholders are asked to approve the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. For a
summary and detailed information regarding this proposal, see the information about the merger and the merger agreement throughout this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the information set forth in sections entitled "The Merger" beginning on page 63 and "The
Merger Agreement" beginning on page 119. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, approval of this proposal is a condition to the consummation of the merger. If this proposal is not
approved, the merger will not be consummated.

        Capella is requesting that Capella shareholders approve the proposal to approve the merger and the other transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement. Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all
shares of Capella common stock entitled to vote at the Capella special meeting, assuming a quorum is present.

Recommendation of the Capella Board of Directors

        The Capella board of directors unanimously recommends that Capella shareholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the
merger.

Capella Proposal 2: The Capella Adjournment Proposal

        Capella shareholders are asked to approve the adjournment of the Capella special meeting to another time and place if necessary or
appropriate to solicit additional votes in favor of the Capella Merger Proposal. The merger agreement provides that the Capella special
meeting will not be postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than ten (10) business days after the date for which the Capella special
meeting was originally scheduled without the consent of Strayer.

        Consummation of the merger is not conditioned on the approval of the Capella Adjournment Proposal.

        Capella is requesting that Capella shareholders approve the proposal to approve the adjournment of the Capella special meeting to
another time and place if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional votes in favor of the Capella Merger Proposal. Approval of this
proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of the greater of (i) a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Capella
common stock present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the Capella Adjournment Proposal, or (ii) a majority of the voting
power of the minimum number of the shares entitled to vote that would constitute a quorum.

Recommendation of the Capella Board of Directors

        The Capella board of directors unanimously recommends that Capella shareholders vote "FOR" the proposal to approve the
adjournment of the Capella special meeting to another time and place if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional votes in
favor of the Capella Merger Proposal.

Capella Proposal 3: The Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal

        Merger-Related Compensation.    Capella is required pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act to include in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus a proposal with respect to a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation that may become payable to each of its
"named executive officers," as determined in accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, in connection with the proposed merger

Table of Contents

pursuant to arrangements entered into with Capella, and Capella is therefore asking its stockholders to approve the following resolution:

RESOLVED, that the compensation that will or may become payable to the named executive officers of Capella in
connection with the merger, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K and as set forth in this proposal titled
"The Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal," is hereby APPROVED.

        The information set forth in the table below under the heading "—Compensation Tables Required by Item 402(t)" is intended to
comply with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, which requires disclosure of information about compensation for each of the Capella named
executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger and assuming the merger is consummated on the latest practicable
date prior to the filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus (December 6, 2017). The compensation arrangements of Capella's named
executive officers that are described in "The Merger—Interests of Capella's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on
page 108 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus are incorporated herein by reference. As the merger is not expected to be consummated
until the third quarter of 2018, Capella has elected to also present a Supplemental Table disclosing expected amounts that may become
payable to a named executive officer if the merger is consummated on June 30, 2018 as certain significant events affecting the
compensation of the named executive officers, particularly their equity compensation, could change the amount of payments they will
receive in connection with the merger. We include this Supplemental Table because we believe it more accurately represents compensation
based on or otherwise related to the merger than do the Compensation Tables Required by Item 402(t) below calculated as of December 6,
2017.

Supplemental Table 

        The Supplemental Table below is provided for illustrative purposes to adjust for compensation events that Capella expects to occur
prior to June 30, 2018. You should carefully review the Compensation Tables Required by Item 402(t) below as well to inform your
voting decision on the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal.

        The information set forth in the table below under the heading "—Compensation Tables Required by Item 402(t)" provides
compensation information assuming the merger is consummated on December 6, 2017, and therefore includes (i) the value of Capella
equity awards that are not expected to accelerate vesting in connection with the merger (such as Mr. Gilligan's market stock unit award,
and any currently outstanding Capella equity awards that are expected to vest pursuant to their terms prior to the expected closing date of
the merger), and (ii) the value of pro-rata payouts under Capella's 2015 - 2017 long-term performance cash program, which are expected to
be paid in accordance with the program's terms prior to the consummation of the merger.

        If the merger instead is consummated on June 30, 2018, the merger-related compensation payments are expected to be as set forth in
the Supplemental Table immediately below (assuming compensation levels do not change, and the executive's continued employment
through June 30, 2018 for purposes of Capella's incentive programs). The Supplemental Table below does not reflect any compensation
decisions that occur after the date of this registration statement, including compensation decisions and awards that may occur in
connection with Capella's regular compensation cycle for fiscal 2018 and includes the value attributable to the accelerated vesting of
equity awards (approved on December 7, 2017 to facilitate tax planning strategies for Capella and certain of Capella's named executive
officers) which otherwise were expected to vest in the ordinary course following the merger, as described in further detail below in "The
Merger—Interests of Capella's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger" beginning on page 108 of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus. In addition, the values reflected in the Supplemental Table attributed to acceleration of equity awards for
Messrs. Gilligan and Polacek would not necessarily be triggered solely by the merger, as they are both

currently eligible to receive accelerated vesting of these awards under the retirement provisions of Capella's equity plans and awards. Any
other assumptions (except for the assumed closing date) used for purposes of calculating the amounts for this table, such as regarding
terminations of employment and the assumed price of Capella stock for purposes of valuing equity awards, are otherwise the same as
described below under the heading "—Compensation Tables Required by Item 402(t)."

Compensation Tables Required by Item 402(t) 

        As mentioned above, the information set forth in the immediately following table is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of
Regulation S-K. Please note that the amounts indicated below are estimates based on the material assumptions described in the notes to the
table below, which may or may not actually occur. Some of these assumptions are based on information currently available and, as a result,
the actual amounts, if any, that may become payable to a named executive officer may differ in material respects from the amounts set
forth below. Furthermore, for purposes of calculating such amounts, Capella has assumed:

• a closing date of the merger of December 6, 2017 (which is the latest practicable date prior to the filing of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, as required); 

• no change in compensation or benefits levels from those in effect on December 6, 2017 (which is the latest practicable date
prior to the filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, as required); 

• each named executive officer's employment is terminated by Capella without "cause" or by the named executive officer for
"good reason" on the closing date; and 

• the value of the accelerated vesting of any Capella equity award is calculated assuming a market price per share of Capella
common stock equal to $82.37 (which equals the average closing market price of a share of Capella common stock on the
NASDAQ over the first five business

Andrew E. Watt   1,242,607  829,006  38,265  2,109,878 

(1) Amounts in this column reflect cash severance that the named executive officer would be eligible to receive under
the Capella Senior Executive Severance Plan, as well as under Capella's annual management incentive program and
long-term performance cash programs. 

As described above, the amounts in this column assume the termination of employment occurs on December 6, 2017,
the assumed closing date for purposes of these calculations, and therefore the amounts do not reflect any additional
compensation an executive might receive based on continued employment following the merger (including under the
transition agreements with each of Messrs. Gilligan and Polacek or the letter agreement with Mr. Watt, each as
described in further detail below in "The Merger—Interests of Capella's Directors and Executive Officers in the
Merger" beginning on page 108 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus).

Cash severance under the Senior Executive Severance Plan would be payable upon a termination of the executive's
employment by the executive for "good reason" or by Capella without "cause," in either case, within 24 months
following a change in control (which would include the merger) (i.e., pursuant to a "double trigger" arrangement),
subject to the executive's timely execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims, which includes, among
other things, customary provisions regarding noncompetition, confidentiality and non-solicitation of clients and/or
employees for a period of time after termination. In such an event, executives would receive: (i) 24 months of base
salary and (ii) two times the executive's target bonus for the year of termination, in each case, payable bi-weekly in
accordance with Capella's standard payroll practices over the 24 month period following the executive's termination.

Under the terms of Capella's annual management incentive program, in the event an executive's employment is
terminated without cause during the performance period (regardless of the occurrence of a change in control), the
executive will be eligible to receive a prorated portion of the final calculated payment under the program in a single
lump sum cash payment when payments are made to other participants following the end of the performance period.

Under the terms of Capella's long-term performance cash programs, in the event of a change in control (i.e., pursuant
to a "single trigger" arrangement), the executive will be eligible to receive a pro-rata payment, based on actual
achieved performance for the truncated performance cycle, which will be calculated immediately prior to the closing
date. Payments under Capella's long-term performance cash programs will be made in a single lump sum cash
payment within 75 days following the closing date of the merger.

For purposes of this disclosure, Capella has assumed that performance through the current year will continue based
on the actual achievement of the performance goals through December 6, 2017.

upon a termination of employment without "cause" within two years following a change in control (which would

officers will vest in full upon a termination without "cause" or for "good reason," in either case within three years
following a change in control (which would include the merger). 

In addition, under the terms of Mr. Gilligan's market stock unit award, if a change in control (which would include
the merger) occurs and Mr. Gilligan's employment is terminated without "cause" or he resigns for "good reason," in
either case within three years following the change in control, then the award will vest in full.

The following table quantifies the value of the unvested Capella stock options and Capella RSUs (including dividend
equivalents) held by the named executive officers that would accelerate upon a qualifying termination of
employment in connection with the merger based on the assumptions described above. These numbers do not
forecast any grants, additional issuances, dividends, additional deferrals or forfeitures of equity-based awards
following the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Depending on when the closing date occurs, certain
equity-based awards shown in the table may vest in accordance with their terms.

vote on the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of the merger. Accordingly, you may vote to approve the Capella Merger
Proposal and vote not to approve the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal or vice versa. Because the vote on the Capella Advisory
Compensation Proposal is advisory only, it will not be binding on Capella. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted and the merger
is approved and completed, the compensation payments that are contractually required to be paid by Capella to its named executive
officers will or may be paid, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, regardless of the outcome of the advisory (non-binding) vote
of Capella stockholders.

        The Capella board of directors will consider the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal to be approved if the votes cast "FOR" the
Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal are of a number greater than the votes cast "AGAINST" the Capella Advisory Compensation
Proposal. An abstention or a failure to vote will have no effect on the vote count for the Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal.

"golden parachute" rules contained in Code Section 280G, the payments will be reduced if and to the extent that
doing so will result in net after-tax payments and benefits for the executive officer that are more favorable than the
net after-tax payments and benefits payable to the executive officer in the absence of such a reduction after the
imposition of the excise tax. The figures reported in this column do not reflect any such reductions as a result of
Code Section 280G limits. No executive officer is entitled to any tax gross-up payment in connection with change in
control payments (or otherwise).

THE STRAYER SPECIAL MEETING 

Date, Time and Place of the Strayer Special Meeting 

        The Strayer special meeting will be held at 9:00 a.m., local time, on January 19, 2018, at Strayer's corporate offices located at
2303 Dulles Station Boulevard, Herndon, VA 20171.

Purpose of the Strayer Special Meeting 

        At the Strayer special meeting, Strayer stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon the following proposals:

1. Share Issuance Proposal 

2. Charter Amendment Proposal 

3. Strayer Adjournment Proposal

        No other business will be acted upon at the Strayer special meeting.

Recommendation of the Strayer Board of Directors 

        The Strayer board of directors recommends that the Strayer stockholders vote "FOR" the Share Issuance Proposal, "FOR" the
Charter Amendment Proposal and "FOR" the Strayer Adjournment Proposal. See "The Merger—Strayer's Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendation of the Strayer Board of Directors."

        Consummation of the merger is conditioned on approval of the Share Issuance Proposal and the Charter Amendment Proposal, but is
not conditioned on the approval of the Strayer Adjournment Proposal.

Strayer Record Date and Quorum 

Record Date

        Only holders of record of shares of Strayer common stock at the close of business on December 11, 2017, the Strayer record date, will
be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Strayer special meeting or any postponements or adjournments thereof. Each share of Strayer
common stock entitles the holder thereof to cast one vote on each matter that comes before the Strayer special meeting.

        As of December 6, 2017, the latest practicable date before the filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, there were 11,167,425
shares of Strayer common stock outstanding.

Quorum

        The presence of the Strayer stockholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, in person or
represented by proxy, is necessary to constitute a quorum. Abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum.
Because all proposals to be voted on at the Strayer special meeting will be "non-routine" matters, we do not expect to receive any broker
non-votes (which are shares of Strayer common stock held by banks, brokers or other nominees that are present in person or by proxy at
the Strayer special meeting but with respect to which the bank, broker or other nominee is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such
shares how to vote on a particular proposal and the bank, broker or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power on such
proposal) and, if you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, your shares will not be counted as present
for purposes of determining a quorum.

Voting by Strayer's Directors and Executive Officers 

        As of December 6, 2017, the latest practicable date before the filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, directors and executive
officers of Strayer and their affiliates owned and were entitled to vote 614,027 shares of Strayer common stock, representing
approximately 5.5% of the shares of Strayer common stock outstanding on that date. Strayer currently expects that Strayer's directors and
executive officers will vote their shares of Strayer common stock in favor of the Strayer Proposals, although none of them has entered into
any agreement obligating him or her to do so.

Required Vote 

        Approval by Strayer stockholders of the Share Issuance Proposal and the Charter Amendment Proposal is a condition to the
consummation of the merger. If either of the Share Issuance Proposal or the Charter Amendment Proposal is not approved, the merger will
not be consummated.

Required Vote to Approve the Share Issuance Proposal

        Approval of the Share Issuance Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast thereon at the
Strayer special meeting, assuming a quorum is present.

Required Vote to Approve the Charter Amendment Proposal

        Approval of the Charter Amendment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the Charter
Amendment Proposal at the Strayer special meeting.

Required Vote to Approve the Strayer Adjournment Proposal

        Approval of the Strayer Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast thereon at
the Strayer special meeting.

Treatment of Abstentions; Failure to Vote 

        If you are a Strayer stockholder and you abstain with respect to a proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the
Charter Amendment Proposal, but it will have no effect on the outcome of the Strayer Adjournment Proposal or the Share Issuance
Proposal.

        If you are a Strayer stockholder and you fail to vote, it will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the Charter Amendment
Proposal, but it will have no effect on the outcome of the Share Issuance Proposal or the Strayer Adjournment Proposal, assuming a
quorum is present.

Voting of Proxies; Incomplete Proxies 

        If you are a stockholder of record of Strayer common stock as of the Strayer record date, a proxy card is enclosed for your use.
Strayer requests that you sign the accompanying proxy and return it promptly in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. You may also
authorize a proxy to vote your shares by telephone or through the Internet. Information and applicable deadlines for authorizing a proxy to
vote by telephone or through the Internet are set forth on the enclosed proxy card. When the accompanying proxy is returned properly
executed, the shares of Strayer common stock represented by it will be voted at the Strayer special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy.

        If a proxy is signed and returned without an indication as to how the shares of Strayer common stock represented by the proxy are to
be voted with regard to a particular proposal, the shares of Strayer common stock represented by the proxy will be voted in favor of each
such proposal, as

applicable. In accordance with the Strayer bylaws and the MGCL, business transacted at the Strayer special meeting will be limited to
those matters set forth in the notice of the meeting.

Your vote is important. Accordingly, please submit a proxy as soon as possible by telephone, over the Internet, or by signing and
returning the enclosed proxy card, whether or not you plan to attend the Strayer special meeting in person.

Shares Held in Street Name and Broker Non-Votes 

        If you hold your shares of Strayer common stock in a stock brokerage account or if your shares of Strayer common stock are held by
a bank or nominee (that is, in "street name"), you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your
shares of Strayer common stock. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or nominee. Please note that you are
not permitted to vote shares of Strayer common stock held in "street name" by returning a proxy card directly to Strayer or by voting in
person at the special meeting unless you provide a "legal proxy," which you must obtain from your broker, bank or nominee. Obtaining a
legal proxy may take several days. Further, brokers who hold shares of Strayer common stock on behalf of their customers may not give a
proxy to Strayer to vote those shares without specific instructions from their customers.

        If you are a Strayer stockholder and you fail to instruct your broker, bank or nominee to vote your shares of Strayer common stock,
your broker will not be permitted to vote on your behalf on the Charter Amendment Proposal, the Share Issuance Proposal or the Strayer
Adjournment Proposal. Failing to provide instructions to your broker, bank or nominee will have the same effect as a vote against the
Charter Amendment Proposal, but it will have no effect on the Share Issuance Proposal or the Strayer Adjournment Proposal, assuming a
quorum is present.

Revocability of Proxies and Changes to a Strayer Stockholder's Vote 

        If you are a holder of record of shares of Strayer common stock on the Strayer record date, you have the power to revoke your proxy
at any time before your proxy is exercised at the Strayer special meeting. You can revoke your proxy in one of three ways:

• sending a written notice of revocation that is received by Strayer prior to the time the proxy is exercised at the Strayer
special meeting, stating that you would like to revoke your proxy, to Strayer's corporate secretary at 2303 Dulles Station
Boulevard, Herndon, VA 20171; 

• submitting a new proxy bearing a later date (by Internet, telephone or mail) that is received by Strayer prior to 11:59 p.m.
(U.S. Eastern Time) on the day preceding the Strayer special meeting; or 

• attending the Strayer special meeting and voting in person.

        Attending the Strayer special meeting will NOT automatically revoke a proxy that was submitted through the Internet or by telephone
or mail. If you wish to change your vote at the Strayer special meeting, you must vote by ballot at such meeting to change your
vote. If your shares of Strayer common stock are held by a bank, broker or nominee, you should follow the instructions provided by the
bank, broker or nominee.

        If you choose to provide a new proxy bearing a later date, you must deliver your new proxy to the corporate secretary of Strayer at
2303 Dulles Station Boulevard, Herndon, VA 20171, no later than 11:59 PM (U.S. Eastern time) on the day preceding the Strayer special
meeting. Revocations may be submitted to the corporate secretary at the address listed in the prior sentence or at the Strayer special
meeting prior to the proxy holder exercising the proxy. If you have submitted a proxy by telephone or through the Internet, you may
revoke your prior telephone or Internet proxy by recording a different

proxy using the telephone or Internet, or by signing and returning a proxy card dated as of a date that is later than your last telephone or
Internet proxy.

Solicitation of Proxies 

        The cost of the solicitation of proxies from Strayer stockholders will be borne by Strayer. In addition to solicitations by mail, Strayer's
directors, officers and regular employees may solicit proxies personally, by telephone, by facsimile or otherwise, without additional
compensation. Strayer will also request brokerage firms, nominees, custodians and fiduciaries to forward proxy materials to the beneficial
owners of shares held of record on the Strayer record date and will provide customary reimbursement to such firms for the cost of
forwarding these materials. Strayer has retained Alliance to assist in the solicitation of proxies and has agreed to pay them a fee of
approximately $12,500, plus reasonable and documented expenses, for these services.

Adjournments 

        Although it is not currently expected, the Strayer special meeting may be adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if
Strayer has not received sufficient proxies to constitute a quorum or sufficient votes for approval of the Share Issuance Proposal or the
Charter Amendment Proposal. Any adjournment may be made without notice, other than by an announcement at the special meeting, to a
date no more than 120 days after the Strayer record date. Pursuant to the Strayer bylaws, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn the
meeting without the approval of the Strayer stockholders. If the Strayer special meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting
additional proxies, stockholders who have already sent in their proxies will be allowed to revoke them at any time prior to their use.

Postponements 

        At any time prior to convening the Strayer special meeting, the Strayer board of directors may postpone the meeting for any reason
without the approval of the Strayer stockholders to a date no more than 120 days after the Strayer record date. If postponed, as required by
law, Strayer will provide at least ten days' notice of the new meeting date. Although it is not currently expected, the Strayer board of
directors may postpone the special meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies if Strayer has not received sufficient proxies to
constitute a quorum or sufficient votes for approval of the Share Issuance Proposal or the Charter Amendment Proposal. If the Strayer
special meeting is postponed for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, stockholders who have already sent in their proxies will be

merger, including the Strayer share issuance, see the information about the merger and the merger agreement throughout this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, including the information set forth in sections entitled "The Merger" beginning on page 63 and "The Merger
Agreement" beginning on page 119. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        Approval of the Share Issuance Proposal is a condition to the consummation of the merger. If the Share Issuance Proposal is not
approved, the merger will not occur. For a detailed discussion of the conditions of the merger, see "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to
Consummation of the Merger."

Required Vote 

        The approval of the Share Issuance Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast thereon at the
Strayer special meeting, assuming a quorum is present.

        The Strayer board of directors unanimously recommends that Strayer stockholders vote "FOR" the Share Issuance Proposal.

Strayer Proposal 2: The Charter Amendment Proposal 

        Strayer stockholders are asked to approve certain amendments to the Strayer charter as shown in Annex B to this joint proxy

        In addition, the amendments will eliminate from the Strayer charter a previously issued series of preferred stock, of which no shares
are outstanding, and delete certain provisions related to that series of preferred stock. The amendments will also include certain
conforming changes. The provisions of the amended and restated charter were negotiated by the parties to the merger agreement and are
considered by the parties to be an integral part of the merger.

that will be in effect as of the consummation of the merger, which is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex B. We
encourage you to read carefully this entire joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes and exhibits to, and the documents
incorporated by reference in, this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the exhibits to the registration statement to which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus relates, for a more complete understanding of the merger and the documents incorporated by reference. This section

General Description of the Merger 

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, Strayer as the combined company will be the remaining corporate entity under which
Strayer University and Capella University will operate as independent and separately accredited institutions.

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Capella, with Capella surviving as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Strayer. In the merger, each share of Capella common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
(other than shares held by Strayer, Capella or Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) will be converted into the
right to receive 0.875 combined company shares.

        After consummation of the merger, Capella shareholders and Strayer stockholders are expected to own approximately 48% and 52%,
respectively, of the outstanding combined company shares on a fully diluted basis, based on the number of shares currently expected to be
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time. Shares of Capella common stock currently trade on NASDAQ under the symbol
"CPLA," and shares of Strayer common stock currently trade on NASDAQ under the symbol "STRA." Following the consummation of
the merger, the combined company shares will be listed on NASDAQ and will continue to trade under the symbol "STRA." Based on the
number of outstanding shares of Capella common stock and Strayer common stock as of December 6, 2017, the latest practicable date
before the filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and the Capella and Strayer equity awards expected to vest in connection with
the merger, a total of approximately 21.7 million combined company shares are expected to be outstanding immediately after the
consummation of the merger.

Consideration to be Received by the Capella Shareholders 

        In the merger, each share of Capella common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares
held in treasury or held by Strayer, Capella or Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) will be converted into the
right to receive 0.875 combined company shares.

        The merger consideration will be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into shares of Capella common stock or Strayer common stock, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to shares of Capella common stock or
Strayer common stock outstanding after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the effective time.

Background of the Merger 

        The Strayer board of directors and management team, in the ordinary course of business, periodically evaluate and consider a variety
of financial and strategic opportunities to enhance stockholder value. The Strayer board of directors and management team review these
opportunities as part of Strayer's long-term business plans and operating strategies in light of industry changes, regulatory developments
and economic trends. Strayer's representatives regularly engage in dialogue and, where appropriate, execute confidentiality agreements
with other participants in the education industry.

        The Capella board of directors and senior management periodically evaluate and assess Capella's financial performance, prospects
and competitive position, as well as strategies to enhance shareholder value, including opportunities to enhance program offerings, the
services it provides to its learners and its overall position in the higher education industry. In connection with these reviews and
assessments, the Capella board of directors and senior management regularly evaluate potential strategic alternatives relating to Capella
and its business, including possible acquisitions, divestitures and business combinations. One of the areas for potential growth that Capella
has considered from time to time is a business combination with another higher education company to the extent consistent with Capella's
long-term strategic goals.

        Strayer and Capella have long been familiar with each other's businesses, as they are the quality leaders among investor-funded
providers of post-secondary education and other academic programs. Certain representatives of each company have become acquainted at
industry events and have from time to time spoken regarding the state of the education industry, the regulatory landscape applicable to
investor-funded educators and other similar and related topics.

        On March 24, 2016, Mr. Robert S. Silberman, Executive Chairman of the Strayer board of directors, and Mr. J. Kevin Gilligan,
Chairman of the Capella board of directors and Chief Executive Officer of Capella, met in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Mr. Silberman had
requested and arranged the meeting. During this meeting, Messrs. Silberman and Gilligan discussed, among other things, recent
developments in the education industry and the possibility of exploring a business combination between Strayer and Capella. The
conversations were high-level, preliminary, and based on publicly available information. At the conclusion of the meeting, Mr. Silberman
encouraged Mr. Gilligan to take time to consider a business combination and to call him if he wished to continue discussions in the future.

        On May 11, 2017, in preparation for the Capella board of directors' annual strategic planning meeting in August, Mr. Steven L.
Polacek, Chief Financial Officer of Capella, called Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC ("Morgan Stanley"), to discuss the higher education
market in general and Strayer in particular. On June 14, 2017, telephonically, and July 14, 2017, in person, Mr. Gilligan, Mr. Polacek, and
Ms. Renee L. Jackson, General Counsel of Capella, met with representatives of Morgan Stanley to discuss further Morgan Stanley's
qualifications, reputation and experience, the higher education marketplace and the development of presentation materials for the Capella
board of directors.

        On August 2 and 3, 2017, the Capella board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting with representatives of Capella senior
management in attendance. At the meeting, among other topics discussed, Mr. Gilligan led a discussion with the Capella board of directors
related to the changing landscape in the higher education market, the growing advantages to achieving greater scale, and various organic
and strategic alternatives. As part of this discussion, he presented a general overview of the higher education market and of Strayer based
on publicly available information provided by representatives of Morgan Stanley at the request of Capella. At the conclusion of the
discussion, the Capella board of directors determined that Mr. Gilligan should reach out to Mr. Silberman to see if there was interest in
restarting a discussion regarding the possibility of exploring a potential business combination between Strayer and Capella. The Capella
board of directors also agreed to consult with Latham & Watkins LLP ("Latham"), which had served as counsel to Capella in previous
transactions,

about advising Capella in connection with such potential business combination. Ms. Jackson subsequently spoke with Latham
representatives about advising Capella related to a potential business combination with Strayer.

        On August 9, 2017, Mr. Gilligan called Mr. Silberman to inquire about his interest in having a further general discussion about recent
industry developments and the possibility of a potential business combination between Strayer and Capella. Mr. Silberman agreed to an in-
person discussion, which was thereafter set for August 22, 2017. Following the call, Mr. Gilligan informed Mr. David W. Smith, Lead
Director of the Capella board of directors, of his conversation with Mr. Silberman and discussed the process for preparing for the
scheduled meeting between Messrs. Gilligan and Silberman. Later that day, Mr. Silberman informed Mr. Karl McDonnell, Chief Executive
Officer of Strayer, Mr. Daniel W. Jackson, Chief Financial Officer of Strayer, and Mr. Viet D. Dinh, General Counsel of Strayer, of
Mr. Gilligan's call, and they discussed a process for evaluating a potential business combination with Capella. They agreed to consult with
Kirkland & Ellis LLP ("Kirkland"), which served as regular outside counsel to Strayer, about advising Strayer in connection with the
exploration of a potential business combination. Mr. Dinh subsequently spoke with representatives of Kirkland about a potential business
combination with Capella.

        On August 22, 2017, the scheduled meeting between Messrs. Silberman and Gilligan occurred in Omaha, Nebraska. At the meeting,
Mr. Gilligan and Mr. Silberman discussed the possibility of a potential business combination between Strayer and Capella.
Messrs. Silberman and Gilligan discussed the possible strategic rationale for such potential business combination and discussed the
potential go-forward strategy of the combined company, including the anticipated benefits to student affordability, academic quality and
student outcomes of such potential business combination. Messrs. Silberman and Gilligan then discussed the structure of a potential
business combination between Strayer and Capella, which was contemplated as a stock-for-stock "merger of equals" with an agreed-upon
exchange ratio. Messrs. Silberman and Gilligan also discussed the anticipated potential future performance of the combined company and
the benefits such future performance would have to each company's respective students, stockholders and shareholders. Messrs. Silberman
and Gilligan agreed to continue their discussion of a potential business combination between the two companies, with structure, price and
other terms to be further discussed.

        Beginning on August 22, 2017 and continuing through the signing of the merger agreement, Mr. Gilligan had periodic discussions
with Mr. Smith and other members of the Capella board of directors regarding his conversations with Mr. Silberman and to provide
updates regarding the status of the exploration of the potential business combination with Strayer.

        Between August 23, 2017 and August 29, 2017, Messrs. Silberman and Gilligan had several telephone conversations during which
they discussed a number of additional preliminary matters relating to the potential business combination. Messrs. Silberman and Gilligan
also agreed to meet together with members of senior management of each company after the Labor Day holiday to exchange more detailed
information regarding their respective companies and to begin to explore potential synergies that could result from a potential business
combination.

        Beginning on August 23, 2017 and continuing through the signing of the merger agreement, Mr. Silberman had periodic discussions
with individual members of the Strayer board of directors about his conversations with Mr. Gilligan. Following the Labor Day holiday, on
September 5 and September 6, 2017, Mr. Silberman informed each member of the Strayer board of directors of his preliminary discussions
with Mr. Gilligan, the upcoming management meetings and his view that Strayer should allocate management resources to explore a
potential business combination with Capella.

        On August 31, 2017, Ms. Jackson sent Mr. Dinh a draft of a mutual confidentiality agreement, which was executed on September 1,
2017. The mutual confidentiality agreement contained reciprocal and customary non-disclosure, non-use, and standstill provisions.

        On September 7, 2017, Messrs. Silberman and Dinh met in New York City, with a representative of Perella Weinberg Partners LP
("Perella Weinberg"), to discuss the investment bank's qualifications, reputation and experience and the possibility of engaging Perella
Weinberg as financial advisor to Strayer. A potential business combination with Capella was not discussed at that time.

        On September 7 and 8, 2017, representatives of Strayer and Capella met in New York City, to exchange overviews of their respective
businesses and to discuss potential synergies that could result from a potential business combination between the companies.
Representatives of Strayer and Capella also discussed operational and integration matters, as well as preliminary regulatory considerations,
and there was a high-level discussion of a potential timing for a business combination, should each company want to proceed with
discussions. They also identified a list of key potential business combination terms, which were not negotiated, including deal structure
and composition of board of directors and senior leadership of the combined company.

        On September 11, 2017, the Strayer board of directors held a meeting, with representatives of Strayer senior management in
attendance. At the meeting, the Strayer board of directors received an update on discussions with Capella and discussed the rationale for
and potential strategic merits of a business combination between Strayer and Capella. Mr. Dinh discussed with the Strayer board of
directors various legal matters, including process considerations. Strayer senior management also provided the Strayer board of directors
with a preliminary view of the regulatory approvals that might be required to consummate the potential business combination. At this
meeting, the Strayer board of directors concluded that none of the directors had any conflicts of interest with respect to a potential business
combination with Capella. Following discussion, the Strayer board of directors directed Mr. Silberman and representatives of Strayer
senior management to exchange due diligence information with Capella and to engage in negotiations regarding a potential business
combination between Strayer and Capella.

        On September 12, 2017, Mr. Silberman called Mr. Gilligan to discuss the Strayer board of directors' general reaction to the potential
business combination based on the discussions that had occurred to date.

        On September 13, 2017, the day before they attended the BMO Capital Markets Back to School Education Conference in New York
City, representatives of Strayer and Capella met to further discuss potential synergies that could result from a business combination
between Strayer and Capella.

        On September 15, 2017, the Capella board of directors held a meeting with representatives of each of Capella senior management and
Latham. At this meeting, Mr. Gilligan and Capella senior management provided an update on the discussions that he and other Capella
representatives had the prior week with Strayer representatives, and he reviewed with the Capella board of directors the strategic rationale
for a potential business combination with Strayer. Mr. Gilligan described the strong alignment between the companies on the learner-first
mindset, the shared beliefs in the advantages of greater scale and the likely cost synergies to be realized from a business combination and
the potential timeline and key issues of such business combination. Capella senior management noted that they placed a call to
representatives of Morgan Stanley to discuss engagement as a financial advisor related to a potential business combination with Strayer,
and the Capella board of directors was in agreement with the engagement of Morgan Stanley. Representatives of Latham reviewed with
the Capella board of directors their fiduciary duties when considering a potential business combination. The Capella board of directors
determined that Capella senior management, together with Capella's legal and financial advisors, should continue discussions and
negotiations with Strayer.

        On September 17, 2017, Mr. Polacek met by telephone with a representative of Morgan Stanley to discuss the possibility of engaging
Morgan Stanley as financial advisor to Capella in a potential business combination with Strayer.

        On September 18, 2017, Mr. Gilligan spoke with Mr. Silberman. Mr. Gilligan reported that the Capella board of directors was
positive about the possibility of a business combination with Strayer. Mr. Gilligan and Mr. Silberman discussed various governance and
structural issues related to the potential business combination, and then discussed the concept of utilizing an agreed-upon exchange ratio
based on a multi-day volume weighted average price. Mr. Gilligan said that he thought the challenge on valuation would be to agree on an
exchange ratio that would reflect the companies' historic performance and the value to be contributed to a combined company.
Mr. Silberman suggested the possibility of using a 30-day valuation period and Mr. Gilligan responded that he believed that a greater
premium to the current trading price for shares of Capella common stock would be necessary, whether accomplished as a longer period for
the volume weighted average price calculation, a special dividend, or some other form. Mr. Silberman indicated that he did not believe that
some of those suggestions would be viewed positively by the Strayer board of directors, but agreed with Mr. Gilligan to continue
discussions after consulting with their respective advisors, management and boards of directors.

        Also on September 18, 2017, Mr. Silberman met with a representative of Perella Weinberg in Herndon, Virginia, to provide him with
an update on discussions with Capella and to discuss the potential engagement of Perella Weinberg by Strayer as financial advisor to
Strayer. Following discussion, Mr. Silberman determined to recommend to the Strayer board of directors at the next board meeting that
Perella Weinberg should be engaged as the Strayer's financial advisor, should discussions with Capella advance to the point of negotiating
definitive terms of a business combination.

        Also on September 18, 2017, representatives of Strayer's and Capella's respective senior management, and representatives of Kirkland
and Latham, discussed the process to be followed in conducting business, legal and regulatory due diligence. They also discussed
regulatory considerations and a possible outline of key business combination terms that might be included in a non-binding term sheet (the
"Term Sheet") that the companies could use to advance exploratory discussions with educational regulators to gain their preliminary views
on a potential business combination between the two companies. The parties agreed that Strayer would deliver a draft Term Sheet to
Capella for review and discussion.

        Following these discussions, the companies commenced due diligence activities, and the due diligence process continued through the
following six weeks until the merger agreement was executed on October 29, 2017. The process included the exchange (primarily through
virtual data rooms), review and analysis of confidential information of each company relating to a range of financial, operational, legal,
accounting, tax and regulatory matters, as well as in-person and telephonic meetings between Strayer's and Capella's respective senior
management teams. Capella and Strayer, as applicable, were supported in their due diligence and negotiations by representatives of
Kirkland, Latham, Perella Weinberg and Morgan Stanley.

        On September 19, 2017, Mr. Polacek and Ms. Jackson held a telephone call with representatives of Morgan Stanley to provide an
update regarding the discussions with Strayer and to discuss the engagement of Morgan Stanley. On September 22, 2017, Mr. Gilligan,
Mr. Polacek and Ms. Jackson had another discussion with representatives of Morgan Stanley regarding the potential business combination
with Strayer. Following these discussions, Mr. Gilligan determined that he would recommend to the Capella board of directors at the next
board meeting that Morgan Stanley should be formally engaged as Capella's financial advisor with respect to the potential business
combination with Strayer, should discussions with Strayer advance to the point of negotiating definitive terms of a business combination.

        Also on September 19, 2017, consistent with the prior day's discussions, Kirkland delivered to Latham a draft of the Term Sheet
setting forth Strayer's preliminary outline of proposed key terms for a possible merger of equals between Strayer and Capella. The Term
Sheet contemplated (i) an all-stock merger, as a result of which each share of Capella common stock would be converted into a number of
share(s) of Strayer common stock utilizing an agreed-upon exchange ratio to be determined by the parties' board of directors and which the
Term Sheet initially proposed be based on a 30-day volume weighted average price, (ii) that the combined company's board of directors
would include both Strayer and Capella directors, (iii) a proposal for leadership of the combined company which included members of
Strayer's and Capella's respective senior management, and (iv) that each of Strayer University and Capella University would remain a
separate legal entity operating under its current name and its existing education identification number.

        On September 24, 2017, Capella senior management provided 5-year standalone projections to Strayer and Perella Weinberg for their
use in connection with their evaluation of a potential business combination between Strayer and Capella. The 5-year standalone
projections were subsequently reviewed and approved by the Capella board of directors in connection with the evaluation of the potential
business combination between Strayer and Capella.

        On September 25, 2017, Strayer senior management provided 5-year standalone projections to Capella and Morgan Stanley for their
use in connection with their evaluation of a potential business combination between Strayer and Capella. The 5-year standalone
projections had been previously reviewed by the Strayer board of directors and were again reviewed in connection with the evaluation of
the potential business combination between Strayer and Capella.

        On September 25, 2017, Messrs. Silberman and Gilligan, representatives of Strayer's and Capella's respective senior management,
and a representative of Latham, met in Chicago, Illinois. The parties identified a range of issues relevant to assessing the advisability of the
potential merger of equals, including governance, regulatory, operational and integration matters and potential synergies. The parties
agreed to continue negotiating the key issues of a final merger agreement and that they would not continue negotiating the previously
proposed Term Sheet. At the end of the meeting, Latham was instructed to prepare an initial draft merger agreement, with mutual and
reciprocal terms appropriate for a merger of equals and the potential business combination. Following the meeting, Latham began working
on the initial draft of the proposed merger agreement with the input of Capella senior management and other advisors to Capella.

        On September 28, 2017, the Capella board of directors held a meeting with representatives of each of Capella senior management,
Latham and Morgan Stanley in attendance at the request of the Capella board of directors. At this meeting, Mr. Gilligan and Capella senior
management reviewed with the Capella board of directors the strategic rationale for a potential business combination with Strayer and
provided an update regarding the due diligence efforts that had been completed to date and the discussions with Strayer senior
management. Mr. Gilligan and Capella senior management noted that these discussions included the potential post-closing ownership of
the combined company that would be determined generally utilizing an agreed-upon exchange ratio based on a volume weighted average
price, the anticipated synergies, the complementary programs and services of the two companies, the senior management of the combined
company, the structure of the potential business combination, and the composition of the board of directors of the combined company.
Representatives of Morgan Stanley reviewed with the Capella board of directors certain preliminary financial analyses. Representatives of
Latham reviewed with the Capella board of directors its fiduciary duties when considering the potential business combination. The Capella
board of directors determined that Capella senior management, together with Capella's legal and financial advisors, should continue
discussions and negotiations with Strayer and provided guidance with respect to such negotiations, including with respect to ownership
and governance of the combined company. After representatives of Morgan Stanley left the call, the Capella board of directors again
expressed its agreement with Capella senior

        On October 5, 2017, Mr. Jackson discussed with Mr. Polacek that his calculation of the exchange ratio would be 0.868 of a share of
Strayer common stock for each share of Capella common stock, based on a VWAP calculation of 90 calendar days. Mr. Polacek in turn

Capella common stock, based on a VWAP calculation of 90 trading days using calculations provided by representatives of Morgan
Stanley.

        On October 9, 2017, the Strayer board of directors held a telephonic meeting. The Strayer board, together with members of senior

approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the following:

• Learner Benefits.  Capella management's expectation that (i) the combined company will be able to leverage the processes,
support and resources of Capella University and Strayer University to benefit learner access and employment outcomes,
(ii) lower combined corporate expenses will position Capella University and Strayer University to extend the affordability
of their offerings and further invest in learner experience and academic outcomes and (iii) Capella University and Strayer
University will be able to share best practices to improve academic outcomes and service. 

• Larger Scale.  Capella management's expectation that, following the merger, the combined company would be a national
leader in education innovation—continuing to operate as independent and separately accredited institutions, but together
offering nearly 135 programs to approximately 80,000 students across all fifty states. 

• Complementary Operations and Expertise.  Capella management's view that Strayer University's degrees in business,
including the Jack Welch Management Institute, accounting, economics, and information technology, and Capella
University's competency-based flexible degree programs, healthcare offerings, and robust doctoral portfolio, are highly
complementary of Capella's existing programs.

the combined company to benefit from the skill sets and capabilities of each company to take advantage of strategic and
innovation opportunities with an enhanced platform, while operating separate brands.

familiarity with the business, operations, financial conditions and prospects of Strayer, and its knowledge of the current and
prospective environment in which Capella and Strayer operate and related industry, economic and market conditions and
trends. The Capella board of directors also relied on its discussions with Capella's management regarding the scope and
results of Capella's due diligence investigation of Strayer, which included review of historical financial results and
projections, existing agreements, contingent liabilities and legal and other matters, and the subsequent recommendation of
the merger by Capella's management. 

• Representation on Combined Company Board.  The fact that the twelve (12) member combined company board will have
three (3) representatives from the current Capella board of directors and nine representatives from the current Strayer board
of directors, which will contribute to continuity of management oversight and an understanding of best practices at both
Capella and Strayer that is expected to facilitate successful integration of the two companies.

achievable corporate-level efficiencies enabling each university to expand innovation, improve affordability and enhance
learning and career outcomes while creating greater value for shareholders.

approximately $50 million, with the combined company achieving full run rate synergies in the first eighteen (18) months

company of approximately 20-25% by 2019.

the likelihood that the merger will be approved by requisite regulatory authorities and holders of Strayer shares and
Capella shares; 

• Superior Proposals.  The right of Capella to negotiate with a third party that submits an unsolicited alternative
acquisition proposal that the Capella board of directors determines would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal for Capella and the ability to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a Superior
Proposal, subject to certain notice requirements, payment of $25 million termination fee to Strayer and a
determination that a failure to take certain actions would be inconsistent with directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable law. The Capella board of directors evaluated, in consultation with Capella's legal and financial advisors,
the amount of the termination fee payable by Capella in circumstances specified in the merger agreement, and
determined that such fee is reasonable and would not unduly impede the ability of a third party to make a Superior
Proposal; 

• Expense Reimbursement and Termination Fee.  Strayer will be reimbursing Capella's transaction expenses up to
$8 million in the event that Strayer stockholders do not adopt the merger agreement and/or paying a termination fee
of $25 million under certain

circumstances described in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses"; and

• Continuing Dividends.  The ability of Capella, between the signing and consummation of the merger, to continue
paying its regular quarterly dividend; 

• Tax-Free Merger.  The expectation that the U.S. Holders of shares of Capella common stock generally will not recognize
any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the exchange of shares of Capella common stock for shares of
Strayer common stock in the merger.

        The Capella board of directors weighed the foregoing advantages and benefits against a variety of potentially negative factors
concerning the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including:

• the challenges inherent in the operation of two businesses under the combined company, and the risk that the cost savings,
synergies and other benefits expected to be obtained as a result of the merger might not be fully or timely realized; 

• the potential for diversion of management focus for an extended period, potential employee attrition and the possible
effects of the announcement and pendency of the merger on student retention and business relationships; 

• the fact that substantial costs will be incurred by both Capella and Strayer in connection with the merger; 

• the risk that Strayer might not meet its financial projections; 

• the risk that Strayer's contingent liabilities may exceed anticipated exposure, and other risks associated with Strayer's
business; 

• the fact that Capella shareholders will be sharing participation in Capella's upside with Strayer stockholders as part of the
combined company; 

• the amount of time it could take to consummate the merger, including the fact that consummation of the merger depends on
factors outside of Capella's control, and the risk that the conditions to consummation will not be satisfied, including as a
result of (i) Capella's shareholders failing to grant the requisite approvals to consummate the merger or (ii) the required
regulatory approvals for the merger failing to be obtained; 

• the risk that educational agencies may object to, oppose or challenge the merger or may impose terms and conditions in
order to resolve those objections that could adversely affect the operational flexibility and financial results of the combined
company; 

• certain terms of the merger agreement, including: 

• the restriction on Capella's ability to solicit alternative transaction proposals; 

• the fact that Capella might be required to hold a shareholder vote on the Capella Merger Proposal, even though Capella's
board of directors might have withdrawn its recommendation prior to the shareholder vote; 

• the termination fee of $25 million and/or expense reimbursement of up to $8 million that Capella would be required
to pay to Strayer if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances described in the section entitled
"The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses"; and 

• the restrictions on the conduct of Capella's business until the effective time (or the termination of the merger
agreement), which may delay or prevent Capella from

undertaking business opportunities that may arise or negatively affect Capella's ability to attract and retain key
personnel;

• the possibility that the merger is not consummated and the potential consequences of not consummating the merger,
including the potential negative impact on Capella, its business and the trading price of the shares of Capella common
stock; 

• the fact that the merger exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted on the closing date based on the relative market
values of shares of Capella common stock or Strayer common stock, which means that the market value of the merger
consideration received by Capella shareholders could decrease prior to the consummation of the merger; and 

• the risks of the type and nature described under "Risk Factors" beginning on page 35.

        In addition to considering the factors described above, the Capella board of directors considered the fact that Capella's directors and
executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Capella shareholders. See "—
Interests of Capella's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger."

        In view of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with the merger, the Capella board of directors did not consider it
practicable to, nor did it attempt to, quantify or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific material factors it considered in reaching
its decision. In addition, individual members of the Capella board of directors may have given different weight to different factors. The
Capella board of directors viewed its position and recommendation as being based on an overall review of the totality of the information
available to it and considered these factors in the aggregate to be favorable to, and support its determination regarding the merger
agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        The Capella board of directors believed that the potential benefits of the merger to Capella and its shareholders outweighed the risks,
many of which are mentioned above. The Capella board of directors realized, however, that there can be no assurance about future results,
including results considered or expected as described in the factors listed above. This explanation of the reasoning of the Capella board of
directors and all other information in this section are forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors
discussed under "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."

        For the reasons set forth above, the Capella board of directors unanimously declared that the merger agreement, the merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Capella and its
stockholders and unanimously approved the merger agreement. The Capella board of directors unanimously recommends to Capella's
stockholders that they vote "FOR" the Capella Merger Proposal, "FOR" the Capella Adjournment Proposal and "FOR" the Capella
Advisory Compensation Proposal.

Strayer's Reasons for the Merger; Recommendation of the Strayer Board of Directors 

        After consideration, the Strayer board of directors, by a unanimous vote of all directors at its meeting on October 27, 2017, approved
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Strayer share issuance and the amendment and restatement
of the Strayer charter.

        In the course of evaluating the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Strayer share issuance and
the amendment and restatement of the Strayer charter, the Strayer board of directors consulted with Strayer's management and Strayer's
legal and financial advisors and considered a number of factors in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement

and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Strayer share issuance and the Strayer charter amendment, including the
following:

• Strategic and Financial Considerations.  The Strayer board of directors believes that the merger will provide a number of
significant strategic and financial benefits that have the potential to create additional value for Strayer stockholders,
including the following: 

• the combination of Strayer and Capella is expected to create a national leader in education innovation that improves
affordability and enhances the learning experience and career outcomes for students by offering complementary
programs, sharing academic best practices and transferability of credits through a best-in-class corporate platform
supporting two independent universities; 

• the complementary capabilities of Strayer and Capella and the expertise of two recognized industry leaders will
enable the combined company to take advantage of the benefits of increased scope and scale and to provide existing
and prospective students with a broader set of offerings and opportunities; 

• the combined company is expected to generate significant cost savings of approximately $50 million within the first
18 months following the consummation of the merger through, among other factors, the consolidation of certain
corporate functions and operations and the sharing of marketing and information technology; 

• the expectation that the merger will likely be accretive on an earnings per share basis for Strayer stockholders by
approximately 20% to 25% by 2019, the first full year following the merger, compared to Strayer on a standalone
basis; and 

• the combined company is expected to have strong cash flows of approximately $80 million in the first fiscal year
following the year in which the merger is consummated and no debt, which will provide the combined company
with an enhanced capability to invest in future growth and deliver attractive returns to its stockholders, including
the expectation to pay $2 per share dividend following the merger. 

• Participation in Future Appreciation.  The fact that, after giving effect to the merger, Strayer stockholders would continue
to own approximately 52% of the combined company on a fully-diluted basis, and, as a result, Strayer stockholders would
participate in the future growth of the combined company and share in the benefits of the expected synergies after the
merger. 

• Knowledge of Business.  The Strayer board of directors' decades of collective experience in education, its familiarity with
the business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects of Capella, and its knowledge of the current and
prospective environment in which Strayer and Capella operate and related industry, economic and market conditions and
trends. 

• Representation on Combined Company Board.  The fact that the 12-member combined company board will have nine
representatives from the current Strayer board of directors and three representatives from the current Capella board of
directors, which would contribute to continuity of management oversight and an understanding of best practices at both
Strayer and Capella that is expected to facilitate successful integration of the two companies. 

• Opinion and Analyses of Perella Weinberg.  The financial analyses of Perella Weinberg presented to the Strayer board of
directors, and the oral opinion of Perella Weinberg rendered on October 27, 2017, which was subsequently confirmed by
delivery of the written opinion, dated October 27, 2017, to the Strayer board of directors to the effect that, as of the date of
such opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors, assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the merger exchange
ratio was fair, from a financial point of view, to Strayer. Perella

Weinberg's opinion is more fully described in the section entitled "—Opinion of Strayer's Financial Advisor."

• Fixed Exchange Ratio.  The fact that the merger consideration is based on a fixed exchange ratio provides certainty as to
the number of shares of Strayer common stock that will be issued to Capella stockholders. 

• Terms of the Merger Agreement.  The Strayer board of directors reviewed and considered the terms of the merger
agreement, including the parties' respective representations, warranties and covenants, the conditions to their respective
obligations to consummate the merger and their ability to terminate the agreement. See "The Merger Agreement" for a
detailed discussion of the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. In particular, the Strayer board of directors
considered the following: 

• Reciprocity.  The terms and conditions of the merger agreement are generally reciprocal; 

• Conditions to Consummation of the Merger; Likelihood of Consummation.  The Strayer board of directors
considered the reasonable likelihood of the consummation of the merger, including Capella's obligations to
consummate the merger, Capella's obligations to take reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals and
the likelihood that the merger will be approved by requisite regulatory authorities and holders of Strayer shares and
Capella shares; 

• Superior Proposals.  The Strayer board of directors has the ability, under certain circumstances and subject to
certain conditions specified in the merger agreement, to consider and respond to unsolicited acquisition proposals
with respect to Strayer and to engage in negotiations with persons making any such acquisition proposal. The
Strayer board of directors may also withdraw or modify its recommendation to Strayer stockholders regarding the
merger under certain circumstances, and terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a Superior Proposal,
subject to certain notice requirements and the requirement that Strayer pay a $25 million termination fee to Capella.
The Strayer board of directors evaluated, in consultation with Strayer's legal advisor, the amount of the termination
fee payable by Strayer in circumstances specified in the merger agreement, and determined that such fee is
reasonable and would not unduly impede the ability of a third party to make a Superior Proposal; and 

• Expense Reimbursement.  Capella will be reimbursing Strayer's transaction expenses up to $8 million in the event
that Capella shareholders do not adopt the merger agreement. 

• Tax-Free Merger.  The expectation that the merger will be treated as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

        The Strayer board of directors also considered various risks and other potentially negative factors concerning the merger agreement,
the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the Strayer share issuance and the Strayer charter
amendment, including the following factors:

• the merger exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted at consummation of the merger based on the relative market
values of Strayer shares or Capella shares, which means that the market value of the merger consideration could increase
prior to the consummation of the merger and, as a result, the premium paid to Capella shareholders could increase; 

• the risk that educational agencies may object to, oppose or challenge the merger or may impose terms and conditions in
order to resolve those objections that could adversely affect the operational flexibility and financial results of the combined
company;

• the fact that Strayer stockholders will not have the sole opportunity to continue participating in Strayer's potential upside as
a standalone company, but rather will share with Capella shareholders participation in Strayer's upside as part of the
combined company; 

• the risk of not realizing all of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the merger within the expected time frame
or at all and that Strayer stockholders will be subject to future financial, business and operational risks associated with the
combined company, which may differ from those of Strayer as a standalone company; 

• the substantial expenses to be incurred in connection with the merger, including costs of integrating Strayer and Capella
and the transaction expenses arising from the merger; 

• the potential diversion of management focus and resources from operational matters and other strategic opportunities and
the risk of any loss or change in the relationship of Strayer with its students, employees and other business relationships
while the merger is pending; 

• the possibility that the merger may not be consummated, or that its consummation may be delayed for reasons that are
beyond the control of Strayer or Capella; 

• the restrictions on the conduct of Strayer's business that are imposed by the merger agreement between the date of the
merger agreement and the effective time of the merger; 

• the terms of the merger agreement placing certain customary limitations on the ability of Strayer to solicit alternative
transactions; 

• the ability of the Capella board of directors, under certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions specified in the
merger agreement, to consider and respond to unsolicited acquisition proposals with respect to Capella and to engage in
negotiations with persons making any such acquisition proposal, to withdraw or modify its recommendation to Capella
shareholders regarding the merger under certain circumstances, and to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into
a Superior Proposal, subject to certain notice requirements and the requirement that Capella pay a $25 million termination
fee to Strayer; 

• Strayer's obligation to pay to Capella a termination fee of $25 million and/or expense reimbursement of up to $8 million if
the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances; 

• the other factors described in the section entitled "Risk Factors."

        The above discussion of the factors considered by the Strayer board of directors is not intended to be exhaustive, but does set forth
material factors considered by the Strayer board of directors. In light of the wide variety of factors considered in connection with its
evaluation of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Strayer share issuance and the Strayer charter
amendment and the complexity of these matters, the Strayer board of directors did not consider it practicable to, and did not attempt to,
quantify or otherwise assign relative or specific weight or values to any of these factors, and individual directors may have held varied
views of the relative importance of the factors considered. The Strayer board of directors viewed its position and recommendation as being
based on an overall review of the totality of the information available to it and considered these factors in the aggregate to be favorable to,
and to support, its determination regarding the merger, the Strayer share issuance and the Strayer charter amendment.

        This explanation of Strayer's reasons for the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the
Strayer share issuance and the Strayer charter amendment, and other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and
should be read in light of the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements."

        For the reasons set forth above, the Strayer board of directors unanimously declared that the merger agreement, the merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the Strayer share issuance and the amendment and
restatement of the Strayer charter are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Strayer and its stockholders and unanimously
approved the merger agreement, the Strayer share issuance and the amendment and restatement of the Strayer charter. The Strayer
board of directors unanimously recommends to Strayer's stockholders that they vote "FOR" the Share Issuance Proposal, "FOR" the
Charter Amendment Proposal and "FOR" the Strayer Adjournment Proposal.

Opinion of Capella's Financial Advisor 

        The Capella board of directors retained Morgan Stanley to provide it with financial advisory services in connection with the proposed
merger and to provide a financial opinion. The Capella board of directors selected Morgan Stanley to act as its financial advisor based on
Morgan Stanley's qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of the business and affairs of Capella. On October 29, 2017, at
a meeting of the Capella board of directors, Morgan Stanley rendered its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written
opinion, dated October 29, 2017, that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Morgan Stanley as set forth in the written
opinion, the merger exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of
Capella common stock (other than the Excluded Shares).

        The full text of the written opinion of Morgan Stanley delivered to the Capella board of directors, dated as of October 29,
2017, is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex D and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. You
should read Morgan Stanley's opinion and this summary of Morgan Stanley's opinion carefully and in their entirety for a
discussion of the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of the
review undertaken by Morgan Stanley in rendering its opinion. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of such opinion. Morgan Stanley's opinion was directed to the Capella board of directors, in its capacity as such, and
addressed only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of Capella common stock (other than the
Excluded Shares) of the merger exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement as of the date of such opinion. Morgan Stanley's
opinion did not address any other aspects or implications of the merger. Morgan Stanley's opinion did not in any manner address
the price at which shares of Strayer common stock would trade following the merger or at any time, and Morgan Stanley
expressed no opinion or recommendation to any holder of shares of Capella common stock or Strayer common stock as to how
such holder should vote at the Capella special meeting or the Strayer special meeting, respectively, or whether to take any other
action with respect to the merger.

        For purposes of rendering its opinion, Morgan Stanley, among other things:

(1) reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of Capella and
Strayer, respectively; 

(2) reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning Capella and Strayer,
respectively; 

(3) reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the managements of Capella and Strayer, respectively; 

(4) reviewed information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the merger, prepared
by the managements of Capella and Strayer; 

(5) discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of Capella, including information
relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the merger, with senior executives of
Capella;

(6) reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for Capella common stock and the Strayer common stock; 

(7) compared the financial performance of Capella and Strayer and the prices and trading activity of Capella common stock
and Strayer common stock with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with Capella and Strayer,
respectively, and their securities; 

(8) reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions; 

(9) participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of Capella and Strayer and certain parties and
their financial and legal advisors; 

(10) reviewed the merger agreement and certain related documents; and 

(11) performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as Morgan Stanley
deemed appropriate.

        Morgan Stanley assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that
was publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to it by Capella and Strayer, and formed a substantial basis for its opinion.
Morgan Stanley assumed that the financial projections provided to it had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and judgments of the respective managements of Capella and Strayer of the future financial performance of Capella
and Strayer. Morgan Stanley assumed that information and projections relating to strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated
from the merger had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
managements of Capella and Strayer. Morgan Stanley relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment by the managements
of Capella and Strayer of: (i) the strategic, financial and other benefits expected to result from the merger; (ii) the timing and risks
associated with the integration of Capella and Strayer and (iii) their ability to retain key employees of Capella and Strayer, respectively. In
addition, Morgan Stanley assumed that the merger would be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the merger agreement
without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the merger would be treated as a
tax-free reorganization, pursuant to the Code. Morgan Stanley assumed that the definitive merger agreement would not differ in any
material respect from the draft thereof furnished to it. Morgan Stanley assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary
governmental, quasi-governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents required for the proposed merger, no delays, limitations,
conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in
the proposed merger. Morgan Stanley noted that it is not a legal, tax or regulatory advisor. Morgan Stanley is a financial advisor only and
relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of Capella and its legal, tax or regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax
or regulatory matters. Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or nature of the compensation to
any of Capella's officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the consideration to be received by the holders of
shares of Capella common stock in the merger. Morgan Stanley did not make any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or
liabilities of Capella or Strayer, nor was it furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Morgan Stanley's opinion did not address the
relative merits of the merger as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such
alternatives could be achieved or are available. Morgan Stanley's opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other
conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to it as of, the date of the opinion. Events occurring after such date may
affect Morgan Stanley's opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and Morgan Stanley did not assume any obligation to update,
revise or reaffirm its opinion.

Summary of Financial Analyses of Morgan Stanley

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Morgan Stanley in connection with the preparation of its
written opinion to the Capella board of directors, each dated as of October 29, 2017. The following summary is not a complete description
of the financial analyses performed and factors considered by Morgan Stanley in connection with its opinion, nor does the order of
analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following
quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before October 27, 2017,
the most recent trading day prior to Morgan Stanley's presentation to the Capella board of directors of its financial analysis on October 29,
2017. Some of these summaries of financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the
financial analyses used by Morgan Stanley, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. The analyses listed in the tables and described below must be considered as a
whole. Assessing any portion of such analyses and of the factors reviewed, without considering all analyses and factors, could create a
misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying Morgan Stanley's opinion. Furthermore, mathematical analysis (such as
determining the average or median) is not in itself a meaningful method of using the data referred to below.

        In performing the financial analyses summarized below and in arriving at its opinion, at the direction of the Capella board of
directors, Morgan Stanley utilized and relied upon certain financial projections relating to Capella and Strayer, provided by the
managements of Capella and Strayer, respectively, and which are described below. In addition, Morgan Stanley utilized and relied upon
the number of issued and outstanding shares of Capella and Strayer provided by the managements of Capella and Strayer, respectively.

Comparable Company Analysis

        Morgan Stanley performed a comparable public company analysis, which attempts to provide an implied value of a company by
comparing it to similar companies that are publicly traded. Morgan Stanley reviewed and compared, using publicly available information,
certain future financial information for Capella and Strayer with corresponding financial data for other companies that shared certain
similar characteristics to Capella and Strayer to derive an implied valuation range for Capella and Strayer. The companies used in this
comparison include the following: Grand Canyon Education, Inc., American Public Education, Inc., Laureate Education, Inc. and Adtalem
Global Education Inc. These companies were chosen based on Morgan Stanley's knowledge of the industry and because they have
businesses that may be considered similar to those of Strayer and Capella.

        For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley analyzed the ratio of the aggregate value (defined as fully diluted market capitalization
plus net debt and referred to as AV) for each of these companies as of October 27, 2017 to estimated calendar year 2018 EBITDA. Morgan
Stanley refers to this statistic as 2018E AV/EBITDA. Morgan Stanley also analyzed the ratio of the closing stock price per share for each
of these companies as of October 27, 2017 to estimated calendar year 2018 earnings per share ("EPS"). Morgan Stanley refers to this
statistic as 2018E Price/EPS.

        Based on this analysis and its professional judgment, Morgan Stanley selected reference ranges of AV/EBITDA of 7.0x - 10.0x and
Price/EPS of 18.0x - 24.0x and applied these ranges to estimated EBITDA and EPS for calendar year 2018 for Capella based on both Wall
Street consensus research estimates based on Institutional Brokers' Estimate System data (the "Capella Consensus Case") and the forecasts
provided by the management of Capella (the "Capella Management Case"). For 2018E AV/EBITDA, Morgan Stanley's analysis resulted in
implied share prices for Capella of $71 to $94, rounded to the nearest dollar, based on the Capella Consensus Case and $69 to $92,
rounded to the nearest dollar, based on the Capella Management Case. For 2018E Price/EPS, Morgan Stanley's analysis resulted in implied

on the Capella Consensus Case and $68 to $90, rounded to the nearest dollar, based on the Capella Management Case.

        Morgan Stanley also applied the selected reference ranges of AV/EBITDA and Price/EPS to estimated EBITDA and EPS for calendar
year 2018 for Strayer based on both Wall Street consensus research estimates based on Institutional Brokers' Estimate System data (the
"Strayer Consensus Case") and the forecasts provided by the management of Strayer (the "Strayer Management Case"). For 2018E
AV/EBITDA, Morgan Stanley's analysis resulted in implied share prices for Strayer of $68 to $91, rounded to the nearest dollar, based on
the Strayer Consensus Case and $71 to $96, rounded to the nearest dollar, based on the Strayer Management Case. For 2018E Price/EPS,
Morgan Stanley's analysis resulted in implied share prices for Strayer of $68 to $90, rounded to the nearest dollar, based on the Strayer
Consensus Case and $72 to $96, rounded to the nearest dollar, based on the Strayer Management Case.

        Morgan Stanley then calculated the exchange ratio implied by the trading multiple analysis. Morgan Stanley compared the lowest
implied share prices for Capella common stock to the highest implied share prices for Strayer common stock to derive the lowest exchange
ratio implied by the trading multiple analysis. Similarly, Morgan Stanley compared the highest implied share prices for Capella common
stock to the lowest implied share prices for Strayer common stock to derive the highest exchange ratio implied by the trading multiple
analysis. The implied exchange ratio ranges resulting from this analysis were as follows:

        Morgan Stanley noted that the merger agreement provided for an exchange ratio of 0.875x.

        No company utilized in the comparable company analysis is identical to Capella or Strayer or directly comparable in business mix,
size or other metrics. Accordingly, an analysis of the results of the foregoing necessarily involves complex considerations and judgments
concerning differences between Capella and Strayer and the companies being compared and other factors that would affect the value of the
companies to which Capella and Strayer are being compared. In selecting comparable companies, Morgan Stanley made judgments and
assumptions with regard to size, business mix, industry performance, global business, economic, market and financial conditions and other
matters, many of which are beyond the control of Capella or Strayer, such as the impact of competition on Capella and Strayer and their
business segments and the industry generally, industry growth and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial conditions
and prospects of Capella and Strayer or the industry or the financial markets in general, which could affect the public trading value of
Capella and Strayer and the companies to which they are being compared.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Morgan Stanley performed a discounted cash flow analysis, which is designed to provide an implied value of a company by
calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows and terminal value of that company. Morgan Stanley performed a
discounted cash flow analysis on both Capella and Strayer based on estimates of future cash flows from September 30, 2017 through
December 31, 2022 and calculated a terminal value at the end of such projection period. Morgan Stanley calculated a range of per share
equity values (as of September 30, 2017) for each of Capella and Strayer.

Capella Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        With respect to Capella, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied total equity values of Capella and values per share of Capella
common stock based on estimates of future cash flows for Capella from September 30, 2017 to December 31, 2022. Morgan Stanley first
calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flows, defined as earnings before interest and taxes burdened by stock-based compensation,
less taxes, plus depreciation and amortization, less capital expenditures, plus provision for bad debt expense and less increases in working
capital, based on the Capella Management Case. Morgan Stanley then calculated a terminal value range for Capella by extrapolating
EBITDA for the next twelve (12) months as of December 31, 2022 based on direction from Capella management and applying a multiple
of AV/EBITDA of 8.0x to 9.0x to such EBITDA. This multiple range was derived based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment. The
forecasted unlevered free cash flows and terminal values were discounted to September 30, 2017 using discount rates ranging from 8.1%
to 10.1%, which were selected based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment and taking into consideration a weighted average cost of
capital calculation ("WACC") and Capella's assumed cost of equity calculated using a capital asset pricing model. Morgan Stanley then
deducted Capella's estimated net debt as of September 30, 2017 from the implied aggregate value ranges.

        Based on the above-described analysis, Morgan Stanley derived a range of implied values per share for Capella as of September 30,
2017 of $78 to $90, rounded to the nearest dollar.

Strayer Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        With respect to Strayer, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of implied aggregate values, total equity values of Strayer and values per
share of Strayer common stock based on estimates of future cash flows for Strayer from September 30, 2017 to December 31, 2022.
Morgan Stanley first calculated the estimated unlevered free cash flows, defined as earnings before interest and taxes burdened by stock-
based compensation, less taxes, plus depreciation and amortization, less capital expenditures and less increases in working capital, based
on the Strayer Management Case. Morgan Stanley then calculated a terminal value range for Strayer by extrapolating EBITDA for the
next twelve (12) months as of December 31, 2022 based on direction from Capella management and applying a multiple of AV/EBITDA
of 9.0x to 10.0x to such EBITDA. This multiple range was derived based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment. The forecasted
unlevered free cash flows and terminal value were discounted to September 30, 2017 using discount rates ranging from 9.3% to 11.3%,
which were selected based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment and taking into consideration a WACC calculation for Strayer and
Strayer's assumed cost of equity calculated using a capital asset pricing model. Morgan Stanley then deducted from the implied aggregate
value ranges Strayer's estimated net debt as of September 30, 2017.

        Based on the above-described analysis, Morgan Stanley derived a range of implied values per share for Strayer as of September 30,
2017 of $91 to $105, rounded to the nearest dollar.

Exchange Ratio Implied by Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Morgan Stanley calculated the exchange ratio ranges implied by the discounted cash flow analyses. Morgan Stanley compared the
lowest implied per share value for Capella common stock to the highest implied per share value for Strayer common stock to derive the
lowest exchange ratio implied by the analyses. Similarly, Morgan Stanley compared the highest implied per share value for Capella
common stock to the lowest implied per share value for Strayer common stock to derive the highest exchange ratio implied by the
analyses. The implied exchange ratio ranges resulting from the analysis was 0.747x to 0.988x. Morgan Stanley noted that the merger
agreement provided for an exchange ratio of 0.875x.

Historical Trading Prices

        Morgan Stanley reviewed the historical trading prices of Capella common stock and Strayer common stock during the 52-week
period ended October 27, 2017, which reflected low to high closing prices for Capella common stock during such period of $65 to $99 per
share, rounded to the nearest dollar, and Strayer common stock of $56 to $96 per share, rounded to the nearest dollar, during such period.
Morgan Stanley calculated the exchange ratio implied by the share price range for Capella and Strayer during the 52-week period describe
above by dividing the Capella share price by the Strayer share price, which resulted in a range of exchange ratios of 0.683x to 1.763x.
Morgan Stanley noted that the merger agreement provided for an exchange ratio of 0.875x.

        The historical trading prices were presented for reference purposes only, and were not relied upon for valuation purposes.

Broker Price Targets

        Morgan Stanley reviewed publicly available equity research analysts' share price targets for Strayer and Capella common stock.
Morgan Stanley noted that the undiscounted price targets issued by those research analysts with publicly available price targets ranged
from $78.00 to $90.00 per share of Capella common stock, rounded to the nearest dollar, and $87.00 to $99.00 per share of Strayer
common stock, rounded to the nearest dollar.

        Morgan Stanley then calculated the range of discounted price targets for each of Capella and Strayer by discounting such targets for
one year using the midpoint of Morgan Stanley's estimate ranges of their respective costs of equity. Based on estimated cost of equity of
9.1% for Capella, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of discounted price targets for Capella of $72 to $83 per share, rounded to the nearest
dollar, of Capella common stock. Based on an estimated cost of equity of 10.3% for Strayer, Morgan Stanley calculated a range of
discounted price targets for Strayer of $79 to $90 per share of Strayer common stock.

        Morgan Stanley then calculated the exchange ratio range implied by the analyst price targets. For each of the standalone price targets
and the discounted price targets, Morgan Stanley compared the lowest analyst target per share for Capella common stock to the highest
research target per share for Strayer common stock to derive the lowest exchange ratio implied by the analyst price targets. Similarly,
Morgan Stanley compared the highest research target per share for Capella common stock to the lowest research target per share for
Strayer common stock to derive the highest exchange ratio implied by the analyst price targets. The implied exchange ratio range resulting
from this analysis was 0.788x to 1.034x for the standalone price targets 0.797x to 1.046x for the discounted price targets. Morgan Stanley
noted that the merger agreement provided for an exchange ratio of 0.875x.

        The public market trading price targets published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect the current market trading
prices for shares of Strayer common stock or Capella common stock, and these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future
financial performance of Strayer and Capella as well as future market conditions.

        The analysts' price targets were presented for reference purposes only, and were not relied upon for valuation purposes.

Contribution Analysis

        Morgan Stanley reviewed the relative contributions of each of Capella and Strayer to estimated aggregate enrollment, revenue,
EBITDA unburdened by stock-based compensation ("SBC"), EBITDA burdened by SBC and EBITDA minus capital expenditures for the
combined company for the calendar year 2018, in each case based both on Capella Consensus Case and the Strayer Consensus Case as
well as the Capella Management Case and the Strayer Management Case. Morgan Stanley also reviewed the relative contributions of each
of Capella and Strayer to discounted cash flow analysis based on forecasts

Case and the Strayer Management Case as described above in the section entitled "—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis" and the median
price targets published by equity research analysts for each of Capella and Strayer as described under "—Broker Price Targets."

        Morgan Stanley calculated the implied contributions shown below for each of Capella and Strayer. The analysis was adjusted to take
into account the impact of Capella's and Strayer's net debt as of September 30, 2017, respectively.

        The analysis indicated the following:

        Morgan Stanley noted that the exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement of 0.875x resulted in an approximate ownership
split of 48% to Capella shareholders and 52% to Strayer stockholders.

Illustrative Transaction Value Creation Analysis

        Morgan Stanley performed an illustrative transaction value creation analysis, the purpose of which is to review the implied increase in
market and intrinsic value to the Capella shareholders based on assumptions regarding synergies and pro forma ownership of the combined
company and based on the intrinsic value calculated from the discounted cash flow analysis for both Capella and Strayer, respectively. The
illustrative transaction value creation analysis was performed for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of actual trading levels and
does not take into account the timing to achieve any synergies or the timing of the consummation of the merger.

        In its illustrative analysis, Morgan Stanley first calculated the then-current equity market value of Capella as of the close of trading on
October 27, 2017, which resulted in a value of approximately $0.783 billion. Morgan Stanley then calculated the then-current equity
market value of Strayer as of the close of trading on October 27, 2017, which resulted in a value of approximately $1.051 billion. Morgan
Stanley then noted that the exchange ratio set forth in the merger agreement of 0.875x implied a pro forma ownership of approximately
48% of the combined company by Capella shareholders and

approximately 52% by Strayer stockholders, using market prices on October 27, 2017, and thus, Capella shareholders would
hypothetically receive approximately 48% of the then-current market value of Strayer and Strayer stockholders would hypothetically
receive approximately 52% of the then-current market value of Capella.

        Morgan Stanley also noted that based on the implied fully-diluted pro forma ownership, Capella shareholders would hypothetically
receive approximately 48% of any increase in market value from synergies in connection with the merger while Strayer stockholders
would hypothetically receive approximately 52% of any increase in market value from synergies in connection with the merger. For
purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley assumed run-rate synergies of $50 million, as directed by Capella management (the
"Synergies"). Morgan Stanley applied an AV divided by next twelve (12) months EBITDA ("NTM EBITDA") multiple of 8.4x to these
synergies, representing an assumed blended multiple for the pro forma company.

        Morgan Stanley also performed the illustrative value creation analysis on a discounted cash flow basis using the midpoints of the
discounted cash flow analysis in the Capella Management Case and the Strayer Management Case as described above in the section
entitled "—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis." For purposes of this analysis, Morgan Stanley applied a midpoint AV/NTM EBITDA
multiple of 9.0x, selected based on Morgan Stanley's professional judgment, to the Synergies and discounted to September 30, 2017 using
a pro forma discount rate of 9.8%.

Market Value

        The illustrative analysis based on market value indicated the following:

        Morgan Stanley noted that the illustrative analysis based on market value indicated a value to Capella shareholders that was
approximately $270 million or approximately 35% higher than Capella equity market value as of the close of trading on October 27, 2017.

Intrinsic Value

        The illustrative analysis based on discounted cash flows indicated the following:

        Morgan Stanley noted that the illustrative analysis based on discounted cash flows indicated a value to Capella shareholders that was
approximately $183 million or approximately 18% higher than Capella equity market value as of the close of trading on October 27, 2017.

Illustrative Future and Present Value Share Price Analysis

        Morgan Stanley performed an illustrative future and present value share price analysis, which is designed to provide insight into the
estimated future implied value of a company's common equity as a function of such company's estimated future EBITDA, for each of
Capella and the pro forma company.

        As part of its illustrative analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated future values for implied prices per share of Capella common stock for
the years ending December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 and discounted the resulting future values to arrive at
present value share prices as of September 30, 2017. To calculate the future values, Morgan Stanley used Capella's estimated NTM
EBITDA, as set forth in the Capella Management Case, for the years ending December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019 and December 31,
2020 and applied an aggregate value to an estimated NTM EBITDA multiple of 6.4x, based on Capella's current aggregate value to NTM
EBITDA based on the Capella Consensus Estimates. To calculate the present values, Morgan Stanley applied a discount rate of 9.1%
based on Morgan Stanley's estimate of Capella's cost of equity.

        The results of this illustrative analysis were as follows:

        Morgan Stanley also performed an illustrative analysis to calculate the pro forma company's future and present value implied price
per share. As part of this analysis, Morgan Stanley calculated future values for implied price per share of the pro forma company's
common stock for the years ending December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 and subsequently discounted such
future values to arrive at present value share prices as of September 30, 2017. To calculate the future values, Morgan Stanley used the pro
forma company's estimated NTM EBITDA, as set forth in the Capella Management Case and Strayer Management Case, including
estimated synergies, for the years ending December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 and applied an aggregate value
to estimated NTM EBITDA multiple of 8.4x, based on an assumed blended aggregate value to NTM EBITDA multiple for the pro forma
company. Morgan Stanley used the exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement of 0.875x to calculate the future value of the pro
forma company as it relates to shares of Capella common stock. To calculate the present values, Morgan Stanley applied a discount rate of
9.8% based on Morgan Stanley's estimate of the pro forma company's cost of equity.

        The results of this analysis were as follows:

        Morgan Stanley noted that the illustrative future and present value share price analysis was presented for reference purposes only and
is not predictive of actual future trading levels.

General

        In connection with the review of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby by the Capella board of directors,
Morgan Stanley performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses for purposes of rendering its opinion. The preparation of a
financial opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to a partial analysis or summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Morgan Stanley considered the results of all of its analyses as a whole and did not attribute any particular weight to any analysis
or factor it considered. Morgan Stanley believes that selecting any portion of its analyses, without considering all analyses as a whole,
would create an incomplete view of the process underlying its analyses and opinion. In addition, Morgan Stanley may have given various

analyses and factors more or less weight than other analyses and factors, and may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable
than other assumptions. As a result, the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis described above should not be taken to
be Morgan Stanley's view of the actual value of Strayer or Capella. In performing its analyses, Morgan Stanley made numerous
assumptions with regard to industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of
which are beyond the control of Strayer or Capella. These include, among other things, the impact of competition on Strayer's and
Capella's businesses and the industry generally, industry growth, and the absence of any adverse material change in the financial condition
and prospects of Strayer or Capella, or the industry, or in the financial markets in general. Any estimates contained in Morgan Stanley's
analyses are not necessarily indicative of future results or actual values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those
suggested by such estimates.

        Morgan Stanley conducted the analyses described above solely as part of its analysis of whether the merger exchange ratio pursuant
to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to the holders of shares of Capella common stock (other than Excluded
Shares) and in connection with the delivery of its opinion, dated October 29, 2017, to the Capella board of directors. These analyses do not
purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which shares of Strayer common stock or Capella common stock might actually trade.

        The merger exchange ratio was determined through arm's-length negotiations between Strayer and Capella and was approved by the
Capella board of directors. Morgan Stanley provided advice to Capella's management and the Capella board of directors during these
negotiations. Morgan Stanley did not, however, recommend any specific exchange ratio to Capella, nor that any specific exchange ratio
constituted the only appropriate exchange ratio for the merger. Morgan Stanley's opinion did not address the relative merits of the merger
as compared to any other alternative business transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are
available. In addition, Morgan Stanley's opinion was not intended to, and did not, in any manner, address the price at which the Strayer
common stock would trade following the merger or at any time, and Morgan Stanley expressed no opinion or recommendation to any
holder of shares of Capella common stock or Strayer common stock as to how such holder should vote at the Capella special meeting or
the Strayer special meeting, respectively, or whether to take any other action with respect to the merger.

        Morgan Stanley's opinion and its oral presentation to the Capella board or directors was one of many factors taken into consideration
by the Capella board of directors in deciding to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Consequently,
the analyses as described above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of the Capella board of directors with respect to the
merger exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement or of whether the Capella board of directors would have been willing to agree to a
different exchange ratio.

        Morgan Stanley's opinion was approved by a committee of Morgan Stanley investment banking and other professionals in accordance
with Morgan Stanley's customary practice. Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm engaged in the securities, investment
management and individual wealth management businesses. Its securities business is engaged in securities underwriting, trading and
brokerage activities, foreign exchange, commodities and derivatives trading, prime brokerage, as well as providing investment banking,
financing and financial advisory services. Morgan Stanley, its affiliates, directors and officers may at any time invest on a principal basis
or manage funds that invest, hold long or short positions, finance positions, and may trade or otherwise structure and effect transactions,
for its own account or the accounts of its customers, in debt or equity securities or loans of Capella, Strayer or any other company, or any
currency or commodity, that may be involved in the merger, or any related derivative instrument.

        Under the terms of its engagement letter, Morgan Stanley provided the Capella board or directors with financial advisory services and
a financial opinion described in this section and attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex D in connection with the
merger, and Capella has agreed to

pay Morgan Stanley a fee, upon rendering its fairness opinion, of $1 million payable upon delivery of the opinion and creditable against
the transaction fee, if applicable. If the merger is concluded, Capella has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley a transaction fee of $15 million,
which is payable upon and is contingent upon the consummation of the merger. In addition, Capella has agreed to indemnify Morgan
Stanley and its affiliates, their respective officers, directors, employees and agents and each person, if any, controlling Morgan Stanley or
any of its affiliates against certain liabilities and expenses, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws, relating to or
arising out of Morgan Stanley's engagement.

        In the two years prior to the date of Morgan Stanley's opinion, other than the services provided in connection with the merger and the
opinion, Morgan Stanley has not provided financial advisory or financing services to Capella or its affiliates. During the same period,
Morgan Stanley has not provided any financial advisory or financing services to Strayer or its affiliates. Morgan Stanley may seek to
provide financial advisory and financing services to Strayer, Capella and their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to
receive fees for the rendering of those services.

Capella Management's Unaudited Prospective Financial Information 

        Capella does not as a matter of course publicly disclose financial projections or forecasts as to future performances, revenues,

financial projections and forecasts. The unaudited financial projections concerning Capella set forth below were made available, except as
otherwise described below, to the board of directors of Capella in its review and evaluation of the proposed merger, to Capella's financial
advisor for its use and reliance in connection with its financial analyses and opinion to the Capella board of directors described under "—
Opinion of Capella's Financial Advisor" beginning on page 82, to Strayer and to Strayer's financial advisor. The summary of these
financial projections is not being included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus to influence the voting decision of any Capella
shareholder or Strayer stockholder with respect to the merger, but instead because these financial projections were provided to Capella,
Strayer and their respective financial advisors in connection with the proposed merger.

        You should note that the financial projections set forth below constitute forward-looking statements and were not prepared with a
view toward public disclosure or with a view toward complying with GAAP, the published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial
information. The information was prepared utilizing Capella's historical accounting policies and does not give effect to the adoption of any
new accounting pronouncements in the future, the impact of which are still being assessed. As such, the unaudited prospective financial

        The financial projections set forth below should not be relied upon as necessarily indicative of actual future results, and readers of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such financial projections. The assumptions and estimates
underlying the financial projections set forth below are inherently uncertain and, although considered reasonable by Capella management
as of the date of their use in preparing the financial projections, are subject to significant business, economic and competitive risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the financial projections set forth below, including,
among others, risks and uncertainties due to general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions, as well as changes in
Capella's or Strayer's, or the combined company's, respective businesses, financial condition or results of operations, and other risks and
uncertainties described under the heading "Risk Factors" beginning on page 35. Accordingly, the financial projections set forth below may
not necessarily be indicative of the actual future performance of Capella, or the combined company after consummation of the merger, and
actual results may differ materially from those presented. Inclusion of the financial projections set forth below should not be regarded as a
representation by any person that the results projected will necessarily be achieved. Furthermore, the financial projections set forth below
may differ from publicized analyst estimates and forecasts and do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the
date they were prepared. Neither Capella nor any other person intends to update or revise the financial projections set forth below and
assumes no obligation to do so.

        The unaudited financial projections include several measures, including EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. "EBITDA" refers to the
Capella's earnings before interest, taxes, share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization. "Free Cash Flow" refers to Capella's
cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Capella may calculate certain non-GAAP financial measures, including
EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, using different methodologies from other companies, and Capella does not provide a reconciliation of the
forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and Free Cash Flow to the comparable GAAP financial measures because it is
unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the GAAP measures, including non-recurring and infrequent items that are not
indicative of Capella's ongoing operations. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors and could have a material impact on
Capella's GAAP results for the applicable period.

        Capella's management prepared unaudited financial projections for Capella for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2017 through
2022. Capella management's standalone projections were based on numerous variables and assumptions including the following key
assumptions: (1) the year-over-year rate of growth in new enrollment improving to mid-single digit in 2018 through 2022; (2) the year-
over-year rate of growth in total enrollment increasing from low single digits in 2018 and 2019 to near the growth rate of new enrollment
by 2021 due to the lagged impact of new enrollment growth; (3) the Post-Secondary segment revenue growth slightly below total
enrollment growth due to the negative impact of degree and program mix on revenue per learner, partly offset by net price increases;
(4) the Job-Ready Skills segment having double-digit annual revenue growth through 2022 but due to continued investments this segment
was not forecast to materially contribute to consolidated net income growth; (5) marketing investments growing at a rate similar to new
enrollment growth and above the rate of revenue growth during the forecast period; (6) efficiency gains including scale benefits partly
offsetting inflation and learner growth with the annual growth rate for all expenses other than marketing forecast to be below the growth
rate of consolidated revenue. The Capella board of

Opinion of Strayer's Financial Advisor 

        Strayer retained Perella Weinberg to act as its financial advisor in connection with a potential transaction with Capella. Strayer
selected Perella Weinberg based on Perella Weinberg's qualifications, expertise and reputation and its knowledge of the business and
affairs of Strayer and the industries in which Strayer conducts its business. Perella Weinberg, as part of its investment banking business, is
continually engaged in performing financial analyses with respect to businesses and their securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, leveraged buyouts and other transactions as well as for corporate and other purposes.

        On October 27, 2017, Perella Weinberg rendered to the Strayer board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in writing
that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the merger exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement was fair from a financial
point of view to Strayer.

        The full text of Perella Weinberg's written opinion, dated October 27, 2017, which sets forth, among other things, the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by
Perella Weinberg, is attached hereto as Annex D and is incorporated by reference herein. Holders of Strayer common stock are
urged to read Perella Weinberg's opinion carefully and in its entirety. Perella Weinberg's opinion was addressed to the Strayer
board of directors for information and assistance in connection with, and for the purposes of its evaluation of, the merger. Perella
Weinberg's opinion was not intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Strayer common stock or
Capella common stock as to how such holders should vote or otherwise act with respect to the merger or any other matter and
does not in any manner address the prices at which shares of Strayer common stock or Capella common

merger agreement or the relative merits of the merger as compared with any other strategic alternative which may be available to
the Strayer. Perella Weinberg was not authorized to solicit, and did not solicit, indications of interest in a transaction with Strayer
from any party. In addition, Perella Weinberg expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the merger to, or any consideration
received in connection with the merger by, the holders of any class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Strayer. This
summary of the opinion of Perella Weinberg is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the opinion.

        In arriving at its opinion, Perella Weinberg, among other things:

• reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information with respect to
Strayer and Capella, including research analyst reports;

the information furnished, or approved for Perella Weinberg's use, by them for purposes of Perella Weinberg's analysis did not contain any
material omissions or misstatements of material fact. Perella Weinberg assumed with the consent of the Strayer board of directors that
there were no material undisclosed liabilities of Strayer or Capella for which adequate reserves or other provisions were not made. With
respect to the Strayer forecasts, Perella Weinberg was advised by the management of Strayer and assumed, with the consent of the Strayer
board of directors, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments
of the management of Strayer as to the future stand-alone financial performance of Strayer and the future financial performance of Strayer
and Capella taken together (except to the extent of inputs therein based solely on the Capella forecasts, as further addressed in the next two
sentences), as the case may be, and the other matters covered thereby and Perella Weinberg expressed no view as to the assumptions on
which they were based. With respect to the Capella forecasts, Perella Weinberg assumed, with the consent of the Strayer board of
directors, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the
management of Capella as to the future stand-alone financial performance of Capella and the other matters covered thereby and Perella
Weinberg expressed no view as to the assumptions on which they were based. Perella Weinberg relied upon the assessment by
management of Strayer that the Capella forecasts were reasonably prepared. Perella Weinberg assumed, with the consent of the Strayer
board of directors, that the anticipated synergies and potential strategic implications and operational benefits (including the amount, timing
and achievability thereof) anticipated by management of Strayer to result from the merger will be realized in the amounts and at the times
projected by management of Strayer, and Perella Weinberg expressed no view as to the assumptions on which they were based. Perella
Weinberg relied without independent verification upon the assessment by the management of Strayer of the timing and risks associated
with the integration of Strayer and Capella. In arriving at its opinion, Perella Weinberg did not make any independent valuation or
appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of Strayer or Capella,
nor was Perella Weinberg furnished with any such valuations or appraisals, nor did Perella Weinberg assume any obligation to conduct,
nor did Perella Weinberg conduct, any physical inspection of the properties or facilities of Strayer or Capella. In addition, Perella
Weinberg did not evaluate the solvency of any party to the merger agreement, including under any state, federal or other laws relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. Perella Weinberg assumed that the final merger agreement would not differ in any material
respect from the form of merger agreement reviewed by Perella Weinberg and that the merger will be consummated in accordance with the
terms set forth in the merger agreement, without material modification, waiver or delay. In addition, Perella Weinberg assumed that in
connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed
that could have an adverse effect on Strayer, Capella or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the merger. Perella Weinberg
relied as to all legal matters relevant to rendering its opinion upon the advice of counsel.

        Perella Weinberg's opinion addressed only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date thereof, of the merger exchange
ratio provided for in the merger agreement to Strayer. Perella Weinberg was not asked to, and did not, offer any opinion as to any other
term of the merger agreement or any other document contemplated by or entered into in connection with the merger agreement or the form
or structure of the merger or the likely timeframe in which the merger will be consummated. In addition, Perella Weinberg expressed no
opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be received by any officers, directors or employees of any parties
to the merger agreement, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the merger exchange ratio or otherwise. Perella Weinberg did
not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that may result from the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement
or any other related document, nor did Perella Weinberg's opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which

Summary of Financial Analyses

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses performed by Perella Weinberg, as well as certain other analyses
performed by Perella Weinberg, and reviewed by the Strayer board of directors in connection with Perella Weinberg's opinion relating to
the merger and does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Perella Weinberg. The order of
analyses described below does not represent the relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Perella Weinberg.

        Some of the summaries of the financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Perella
Weinberg's financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a
complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data below without considering the full narrative description of the
financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of
Perella Weinberg's financial analyses.

Selected Publicly-Traded Companies Analysis

        Perella Weinberg performed a selected publicly-traded companies analysis, which is a method of deriving an implied value range for
a company's equity securities based on a review of selected publicly-traded companies generally deemed relevant for comparative
purposes. Perella Weinberg reviewed and compared certain financial information for Strayer and Capella to corresponding financial
information, financial market multiples and ratios of the following selected publicly-traded companies:

• Grand Canyon Education, Inc. 

• Bridgepoint Education, Inc. 

• Laureate Education, Inc. 

• American Public Education, Inc. 

• Career Education Corporation 

• Adtalem Global Education Inc.

        Although none of the above companies is identical to Strayer or Capella, Perella Weinberg selected these companies because they had
publicly traded equity securities and were deemed to be similar to Strayer and Capella in one or more respects, including operating in the
post-secondary for-profit education sector.

        For each of the selected public-traded companies, Perella Weinberg calculated and compared financial information and financial
market multiples and ratios based on company filings for historical information and consensus third party research estimates for forecasted
information. For Strayer and Capella, Perella Weinberg made calculations based on company filings for historical information and both
consensus third party research estimates and the Strayer forecasts and the Capella forecasts for forecasted information.

Table of Contents

        For each of Strayer, Capella and the selected publicly-traded companies, Perella Weinberg reviewed (i) the ratio of enterprise value
(which represents equity value based on such company's closing share price as of October 26, 2017 plus book values of total debt and
debt-like items, including preferred stock and minority interest, and less excess cash ("EV")) to estimated calendar year 2018 earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, with stock based compensation expensed ("EBITDA") based on consensus third party
research estimates and (ii) the ratio of stock market capitalization (based on such company's closing share price as of October 26, 2017) to
estimated calendar year 2018 net income based on consensus third party research estimates. Perella Weinberg assumed that each of
Strayer, Capella and the publicly traded companies reviewed had "excess cash" only to the extent its respective cash balance exceeded
$150,000,000. The results of these analyses are summarized in the following table:

        Perella Weinberg also took into consideration the historical forward trading multiples over the last year for each of Strayer and
Capella as well as median of the selected publicly-traded companies.

        Based on the analysis of the relevant metrics described above and on professional judgments made by Perella Weinberg, Perella
Weinberg selected and applied a range of multiples of 8.0x to 11.5x to 2018E EBITDA of Strayer using consensus third party research
estimates and the Strayer forecasts and to 2018E EBITDA of Capella using consensus third party research estimates and the Capella
forecasts. Further, based on the analysis of the relevant metrics described above and on professional judgments made by Perella Weinberg,
Perella Weinberg applied a range of 17.5x to 21.5x to 2018E net income of Strayer using consensus third party research estimates and the
Strayer forecasts and to 2018E net income of Capella using consensus third party research estimates and the Capella forecasts. From these
analyses, Perella Weinberg derived ranges of implied equity values for each of Strayer and Capella. Perella Weinberg calculated implied
values per share by dividing the implied equity values by the applicable fully diluted shares (based upon the number of issued and
outstanding shares and other equity interests in each case provided by the managements of Capella and Strayer, as applicable, and

using the treasury method for calculation of option dilution). The ranges of implied values per share derived from these calculations are
summarized in the following table:

        Perella Weinberg compared these implied value ranges per share for Strayer common stock to both the October 26, 2017 trading price
per share for Strayer common stock of $90.85 and to the value per share for Strayer common stock implied in the merger of $83.03 (the
"Strayer implied merger price"). Perella Weinberg also compared these implied value ranges per share for Capella common stock to both
the October 26, 2017 trading price per share for Capella common stock of $65.50 and to the value per share for Capella common stock
implied in the merger of $72.65 (the "Capella implied merger price"). The Strayer implied merger price was calculated by Perella
Weinberg by calculating a combined company stock market capitalization equal to the sum of the stock market capitalizations of Strayer
and Capella as of October 26, 2017 and dividing this combined company stock market capitalization by the estimated number of fully
diluted pro forma shares outstanding of the combined company as of October 26, 2017 including all vested and unvested stock based
compensation (based upon the number of issued and outstanding shares and other equity interests in each case provided by the
managements of Capella and Strayer, as applicable, and using the treasury method for calculation of option dilution). The Capella implied
merger price was calculated by Perella Weinberg by applying the 0.875x merger exchange ratio to the Strayer implied merger price.

        Perella Weinberg then calculated the exchange ratio ranges implied by the selected publicly-traded companies analysis. For each of
the foregoing analyses, Perella Weinberg then calculated (i) the ratio of the highest implied value per share for Capella derived from the
selected publicly-traded companies analysis to the lowest implied value per share for Strayer derived from the selected publicly-traded
companies analysis and (ii) the ratio of the lowest implied value per share for Capella derived from the selected publicly-traded companies
analysis to the highest implied value per share for Strayer derived from the selected publicly-traded companies analysis to calculate the
following implied exchange ratio ranges:

        Perella Weinberg compared these implied exchange ratio ranges to the merger exchange ratio.

        Although the selected publicly-traded companies were used for comparison purposes, no business of any selected company was either
identical or directly comparable to Strayer's or Capella's business. Perella Weinberg's comparison of selected publicly-traded companies to

analysis of the results of such comparisons were not purely mathematical, but instead necessarily involved complex considerations and
judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the relative values of the
selected publicly-traded companies, Strayer and Capella.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Perella Weinberg performed a discounted flow analysis, which is a method of deriving an implied value range for a company's equity
securities based on the sum of the company's unlevered free cash flows over a forecast period and the terminal value at the end of the
forecast period. In performing this analysis, Perella Weinberg used the Strayer forecasts and the Capella forecasts and:

• calculated, in each case, the present value as of December 31, 2017 of the estimated standalone unlevered free cash flows
(calculated as operating income, including stock based compensation expense, after taxes, plus depreciation and
amortization, minus capital expenditures, and adjusting for changes in net working capital) that each of Strayer and Capella
could generate for fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2022 using the Strayer forecasts and the Capella forecasts,
respectively, and using discount rates ranging from 10.75% to 11.75% for Strayer and 9.50% to 10.25% for Capella, in
each case based on estimates of the weighted average cost of capital of each company; and 

• calculated, in each case, a range of terminal values for each of Strayer and Capella by applying a perpetual growth rate
ranging from 4.0% to 5.0% for each company and discounted using discount rates ranging from 10.75% to 11.75% for
Strayer and 9.50% to 10.25% for Capella. Perella Weinberg observed the implied calculated ranges of forward exit
multiples under the analysis of 6.8x to 9.1x EBITDA and 13.3x to 17.8x net income for Strayer and 7.9x to 10.9x EBITDA
and 15.9x to 21.9x net income for Capella, in each case, as of 2022.

        From the ranges of implied enterprise values generated by the foregoing analysis, Perella Weinberg derived ranges of implied equity
values for each of Stayer and Capella by subtracting debt and debt-like items and adding excess cash. Perella Weinberg assumed that each
of Strayer and Capella had "excess cash" only to the extent its respective cash balance exceeded $150,000,000. Perella Weinberg
calculated implied values per share by dividing the implied equity values by the applicable fully diluted shares (based upon the number of
issued and outstanding shares and other equity interests in each case provided by the managements of Capella and Strayer, as applicable,
and using the treasury method for calculation of option dilution). The discounted cash flow analysis did not consider estimated synergies
resulting from the proposed combination. The ranges of implied values per share derived from these calculations are summarized in the
following table:

        Perella Weinberg compared these implied value ranges per share for Strayer common stock and Capella common stock to the Strayer
implied merger price and the Capella implied merger price, respectively.

        Perella Weinberg then calculated the exchange ratio range implied by the discounted cash flow analysis, by calculating, for the
foregoing analysis, (i) the ratio of the highest implied value per share for Capella derived from the discounted cash flow analysis to the
lowest implied value per share for Strayer derived from the discounted cash flow analysis and (ii) the ratio of the lowest implied value per
share for Capella derived from the discounted cash flow analysis to the highest implied value per share for Strayer derived from the
discounted cash flow analysis to derive an implied exchange ratio range of

Exchange Ratio Over Time

        Perella Weinberg observed the ratio of the price of Capella common stock to the price of Strayer common stock for October 26, 2017
as well as each of the thirty (30) day, ninety (90) day, one year and five year periods ended October 26, 2017 and since the latest U.S.
presidential election through October 26, 2017. For each applicable period, Perella Weinberg divided the daily VWAP per share of Capella
common stock during the applicable period by the daily VWAP per share of Strayer common stock during the applicable period to
calculate the stock price ratio for that period. Perella Weinberg also calculated the percentage of the combined company that would be
owned by Strayer stockholders if each observed stock price ratio were the exchange ratio applicable to the merger, assuming fully diluted
shares outstanding of each company as of October 26, 2017 including all vested and unvested stock based compensation (based upon the
number of issued and outstanding shares and other equity interests in each case provided by the managements of Capella and Strayer, as
applicable, and using the treasury method for calculation of option dilution). The results of these calculations are summarized in the
following table:

        Perella Weinberg compared these stock price ratios to the merger exchange ratio. Perella Weinberg also compared the percentage of
Strayer stockholder ownership of the combined company generated from the foregoing illustrative calculations to the implied Strayer
stockholder ownership of the combined company of approximately 52%, based on an implied number of shares of Strayer common stock
issued to Capella shareholders based on the merger exchange ratio and fully diluted shares outstanding (based upon the number of issued
and outstanding shares and other equity interests in each case provided by the managements of Capella and Strayer, as applicable, and
using the treasury method for calculation of option dilution).

Historical Stock Trading

        Perella Weinberg reviewed the historical closing market prices for each of Strayer common stock and Capella common stock for the

        Perella Weinberg compared these value ranges per share for Strayer common stock and Capella common stock to the Strayer implied
merger price and the Capella implied merger price, respectively.

        Perella Weinberg then calculated the exchange ratio ranges implied by the historical stock trading review. Perella Weinberg calculated
the ratios of (i) the highest closing market price of Capella common stock during each period to the lowest closing market price of Strayer
common stock during each period and (ii) the ratio of the lowest closing market price of Capella common stock during each period to the
highest closing market price of Strayer common stock during each period to derive the following implied exchange ratio ranges:

        Perella Weinberg compared these implied exchange ratio ranges to the merger exchange ratio.

Equity Research Analyst Price Target Statistics

        Perella Weinberg observed the most recent publicly available research analyst price targets for Strayer common stock prepared and
published by three selected equity research analysts prior to October 26, 2017. Perella Weinberg noted that the range of these recent equity
analyst price targets for Strayer common stock was $80.31 to $89.07 per share, in each case as discounted to October 26, 2017 using an
11.25% cost of equity.

        Perella Weinberg also observed the most recent publicly available research analyst price targets for Capella common stock prepared
and published by four selected equity research analysts prior to October 26, 2017. Perella Weinberg noted that the range of these recent
equity analyst price targets for Capella common stock was $71.05 to $82.25 per share, in each case as discounted to October 26, 2017
using an 9.88% cost of equity.

        Perella Weinberg compared these value ranges per share for Strayer common stock and Capella common stock to the Strayer implied
merger price and the Capella implied merger price, respectively.

        Perella Weinberg then calculated the exchange ratio range implied by the equity research analyst price target statistics review. Perella
Weinberg calculated the ratios of (i) the highest most recently publicly available research analyst price target for Capella common stock
(discounted as detailed above) to the lowest most recently publicly available research analyst price target for Strayer common stock
(discounted as detailed above) and (ii) the lowest most recently publicly available research analyst price target for Capella common stock
(discounted as detailed above) to the highest most recently publicly available research analyst price target for Strayer common stock
(discounted as detailed above) to derive an implied exchange ratio range of 0.798x to 1.024x. Perella Weinberg compared this implied
exchange ratio range to the merger exchange ratio.

Table of Contents

        The public market trading prices published by equity research analysts do not necessarily reflect current market trading prices for
Strayer common stock or Capella common stock. Further, these estimates are subject to uncertainties, including the future financial
performance of Strayer and Capella and future market conditions, and the public market trading price targets published by equity research
analysts typically represent price targets to be achieved over a six (6) to twelve (12) month period.

Relative Contribution Analysis

        Perella Weinberg reviewed the relative contribution of Strayer and Capella to the forecasted fiscal year 2018 EBITDA and net income
(excluding transaction adjustments and synergies). Perella Weinberg also reviewed the relative contribution of Strayer and Capella to the
combined stock market capitalization as of October 26, 2017. The estimated 2018 EBITDA and net income of Strayer and Capella were
based on the Strayer forecasts and the Capella forecasts, respectively. The relative contribution analysis did not give effect to the impact of
any estimated synergies resulting from the proposed combination. The results of these analyses are summarized in the following table:

        Perella Weinberg compared these relative contributions to the implied Strayer stockholder and Capella shareholder ownership of the
combined company of approximately 52% and 48%, respectively, based on an implied number of shares of Strayer common stock issued
to Capella shareholders based on the merger exchange ratio and fully diluted shares outstanding (based upon the number of issued and
outstanding shares and other equity interests in each case provided by the managements of Capella and Strayer, as applicable, and using
the treasury method for calculation of option dilution).

Selected Transactions

        For informational purposes only, Perella Weinberg reviewed and analyzed the financial terms of selected transactions involving
companies in the post-secondary for-profit education sector that Perella Weinberg deemed relevant. However, as discussed with the Strayer
board of directors, in arriving at its opinion, Perella Weinberg did not rely on a selected transactions analysis. As the proposed combination
is not a change-of-control transaction, the precedent change-of-control transactions identified were not directly relevant and were not
relied upon by Perella Weinberg to arrive at its opinion. Perella Weinberg also did not believe that there were any recent precedent
transactions in the post-secondary for-profit education sector that were comparable to the merger due to the dramatic changes in this
industry, the regulatory environment in which this industry operates and the performance of the companies operating therein since the
dates of prior transactions in this industry.

Miscellaneous

        The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary
description. Selecting portions of the analyses or of the summary set forth herein, without considering the analyses or the summary as a
whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Perella Weinberg's opinion. In arriving at its fairness determination,
Perella Weinberg considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis
considered. Rather, Perella Weinberg made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after
considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or transaction used in the analyses described herein as a comparison is directly
comparable to Strayer, Capella or the merger.

Table of Contents

        Perella Weinberg prepared the analyses described herein for purposes of providing its opinion to the Strayer board of directors as to
the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of such opinion, of the merger exchange ratio provided in the merger agreement
to Strayer. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be
sold. Perella Weinberg's analyses were based in part upon the Strayer forecasts and the Capella forecasts and third party research analyst
estimates, which are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, and which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by Perella Weinberg's analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors
or events beyond the control of the parties to the merger agreement or their respective advisors, none of Strayer, Capella, Perella Weinberg
or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecasted by the Strayer or Capella
management or third parties.

        As described above, the opinion of Perella Weinberg to the Strayer board of directors was one of many factors taken into
consideration by the Strayer board of directors in making its determination to approve the merger. Perella Weinberg was not asked to, and
did not, recommend the merger exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement, which consideration was determined through arms-
length negotiations between Strayer and Capella. Perella Weinberg did not recommend any specific exchange ratio to the holders of
Strayer common stock or the Strayer board of directors or that any specific exchange ratio constituted the only appropriate exchange ratio
or consideration for the merger.

        Pursuant to the terms of the engagement letter between Perella Weinberg and Strayer dated October 6, 2017, Strayer paid Perella
Weinberg a retainer fee in the amount of $500,000 and further agreed to pay Perella Weinberg $2,500,000 upon the delivery of Perella
Weinberg's opinion and an additional transaction fee of $8,000,000 upon the consummation of the merger. Strayer has agreed to pay
Perella Weinberg a fee equal to 20% of any break-up, termination, topping or similar fee received by Strayer upon receipt thereof,
provided that such fee may not exceed the expected total transaction fee that would have been received if the merger had been
consummated. In addition, Strayer agreed to reimburse Perella Weinberg for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, and to indemnify
Perella Weinberg and related persons for certain liabilities and other items that may arise out of its engagement by Strayer and the
rendering of its opinion. None of these payments affected Perella Weinberg's analysis or opinion.

        During the two year period prior to the date hereof, neither Perella Weinberg nor its affiliates have had material relationships, other
than the services provided in connection with the merger and the rendering of its opinion, with Strayer, Capella or their respective affiliates
for which compensation was received or is intended to be received by Perella Weinberg or its affiliates. Perella Weinberg and its affiliates
may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to Strayer, Capella and their respective affiliates and in the
future may receive compensation for the rendering of such services. In the ordinary course of their business activities, Perella Weinberg or
its affiliates may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions, for their own accounts or the
accounts of customers or clients, in debt or equity or other securities (or related derivative securities) or financial instruments (including
bank loans or other obligations) of Strayer, Capella or any of their respective affiliates.

Strayer Management's Unaudited Prospective Financial Information 

        Although Strayer periodically may issue limited financial guidance to investors, Strayer does not as a matter of course make public
long-term projections as to future revenue, earnings or other results, due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of the underlying
assumptions and estimates. However, Strayer's management prepared and reviewed with Strayer's board of directors unaudited 5-year
standalone prospective financial information regarding Strayer's operations for fiscal years 2018 through 2022 (the "Strayer standalone
projections"), which were provided to Strayer's financial advisor, Perella Weinberg, in connection with Perella Weinberg's financial
analyses.

        The Strayer standalone projections were also provided to Capella for its use in connection with its evaluation of the merger and for
the use of Capella's financial advisor in connection with its financial analyses. For more information, see the section entitled "—
Background of the Merger."

        The below summary of the Strayer standalone projections are included for the purpose of providing stockholders access to certain
nonpublic information that was furnished to certain parties in connection with the merger, and such information may not be appropriate for
other purposes, and is not included to influence the voting decision of any Strayer stockholder or Capella shareholder.

        The below unaudited prospective financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor was it prepared
with a view toward compliance with GAAP. The information was prepared utilizing Strayer's historical accounting policies and does not
give effect to the adoption of any new accounting pronouncements in the future, the impact of which are still being assessed. As such, the
unaudited prospective financial information also was not prepared with a view toward or pending new accounting pronouncements, the
published guidelines of the SEC regarding projections and forward-looking statements, or the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentations of financial projections. The inclusion of this unaudited
prospective financial information should not be regarded as an indication that such information is predictive of actual future events or
results and such information should not be relied upon as such, and readers of this joint proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on the prospective financial information. Furthermore, the unaudited prospective financial information does not take
into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date it was prepared. The prospective financial information included in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, Strayer's management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
has neither audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the accompanying prospective
financial information and, accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with
respect thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this joint proxy statement/prospectus relates to the
Strayer's historical financial information. It does not extend to the unaudited prospective financial information and should not be read to do
so.

        While presented with numeric specificity, this unaudited prospective financial information was based on numerous variables and
assumptions (including assumptions related to industry performance and general business, economic, market and financial conditions and
additional matters specific to Strayer's business) that are inherently subjective and uncertain and are beyond the control of Strayer's
management. Important factors that may affect actual results and cause this unaudited prospective financial information not to be achieved
include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to Strayer's business (including Strayer's ability to achieve strategic goals,
objectives and targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other factors
described in the sections entitled "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors." This unaudited
prospective financial information also reflects numerous variables, expectations and assumptions available at the time they were prepared
as to certain business decisions that are subject to change and the Strayer standalone projections are based solely on the information
available to Strayer's management at the time they were prepared. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in
this unaudited prospective financial information. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized below will
be realized. Strayer stockholders and Capella shareholders are urged to review the most recent SEC filings of Strayer for a description of
the reported results of operations and financial condition and capital resources of Strayer, including in "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Strayer's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2016, and any subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        None of Strayer, Capella or their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other representatives can give you any assurance
that actual results will not differ materially from this unaudited prospective financial information. Strayer undertakes no obligation to
update or otherwise revise or reconcile this unaudited prospective financial information to reflect circumstances existing after the date this
unaudited prospective financial information was generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of
the assumptions underlying such information are shown to be in error. Since the unaudited prospective financial information covers
multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year.

        Strayer may calculate certain non-GAAP financial metrics, including EBITDA and Distributable Free Cash Flow, using different
methodologies from Capella and from other companies. Consequently, the financial metrics presented in Strayer's and Capella's
prospective financial information disclosures and in the sections of this joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the opinions of the
financial advisors to Strayer and Capella may not be directly comparable to one another. Strayer is not providing a quantitative
reconciliation of the forward looking non-GAAP financial metrics set forth below.

        Strayer has not made and makes no representation to Capella or any Strayer stockholder or Capella shareholder, in the merger
agreement or otherwise, concerning this unaudited prospective financial information or regarding Strayer's ultimate performance compared
to the unaudited prospective financial information or that the projected results will be achieved. In light of the foregoing factors and the
uncertainties inherent in the unaudited prospective financial information, Strayer urges all Strayer stockholders and Capella shareholders
not to place undue reliance on such information and to review Strayer's and Capella's most recent SEC filings for a description of Strayer's
and Capella's reported financial results.

Strayer Standalone Projections

        The following is a summary of the Strayer standalone projections. The Strayer standalone projections were based on numerous
variables and assumptions, including the following key assumptions:

• Approximately 5% new student growth in 2018 and 2019, followed by 3.75% new student growth in 2020 to 2022,
resulting from expansion of new programs such as Nursing, Digital Entrepreneurship, and Applied Sciences as well as
continued growth in our core Business and IT program offerings 

• Increases in marketing costs are expected to outpace new student enrollment by approximately 4% due to inflation in cost
per inquiry and additional marketing investment to support new program launches 

• Continued investment in course content, faculty performance, and the collection and use of data analytics will continue to
drive improvement in student retention of approximately 0.25% per year 

• New student growth combined with retention improvements result in approximately 6% total enrollment growth per year 

• Growth in tuition discounts associated with corporate partnerships as well as scholarship programs targeting highly
qualified student populations will result in continued declines in revenue per student through 2021. Declines in revenue per
student expected to be in the –1 to –3% range in 2018 to 2019, then flatten to –1% to 0% in 2020 to 2022 

• Non-marketing expense inflation of 2 to 3% per year. Ability to scale classroom experience results in operating margins
expansion to 18% in 2022 

• Assumed tax rate of 39.5%

Board and Management of the Combined Company 

Board of Directors of the Combined Company after the Merger

        At the effective time, the board of directors of the combined company will consist of (a) nine directors designated by Strayer, (b) J.
Kevin Gilligan, Chief Executive Officer of Capella, and (c) two additional designees who are currently members of the Capella board of
directors and are recommended by Mr. Gilligan. In addition, one of the two additional Capella designees will be appointed to serve on the
Compensation Committee of the combined company.

        Robert Silberman will continue as Executive Chairman of the board of directors of the combined company and at the effective time,

        As of the effective time, Robert Silberman will continue as Executive Chairman of the board of directors of the combined company
and Mr. Gilligan will be appointed as Vice Chairman at the effective time. Karl McDonnell, Strayer's current President and Chief
Executive Officer, and Daniel W. Jackson, Strayer's current Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will continue in their
respective positions at the combined company following the effective time. Steven L. Polacek, Capella's current Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer will be appointed as the Chief Integration/Transition Officer of the combined company.

        Biographical information for those executive officers named above and not included in the companies' respective annual meeting
proxy statements as described under "—Board of Directors of the Combined Company after the Merger" is incorporated by reference from
Strayer's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the SEC on February 17, 2017 (with respect
Messrs. McDonnel and Jackson), and Capella's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the SEC
on February 22, 2017 (with respect to Mr. Polacek).

Interests of Capella's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of Capella's board of directors with respect to adopting the Capella Proposals, Capella
stockholders should be aware that certain members of the Capella board of directors and executive officers may have interests in the
merger that are different from, or are in addition to, interests of Capella stockholders generally. These interests may create an appearance
of a conflict of interest. The Capella board of directors was aware of these potential conflicts of interests during its deliberations on the
merits of the merger and in making its decisions in approving the merger, the merger agreement, and the related transactions. These
potential conflicts of interests are described in more detail below, and certain potential conflicts of interest are quantified in the tables in
the section entitled "Capella Proposals—Capella Proposal 3: The Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal" beginning on page 51.

Treatment of Capella Equity Awards in the Merger

        Under the merger agreement, at the effective time, Strayer will assume all the obligations of Capella under the Capella 2005 Stock
Incentive Plan and 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, and each Capella stock option and Capella RSU will be assumed by Strayer and converted
into a comparable Strayer form of equity award based upon the merger exchange ratio but otherwise subject to the same terms and
conditions as set forth under the award prior to the conversion, except that each Capella stock option held by a Capella non-employee
director who will not be a member of the Strayer board of directors immediately following the effective time will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the merger consideration the non-employee director would have been entitled to receive if the Capella
stock option had been exercised for shares of Capella common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (net of the
applicable exercise price). In addition, unvested Capella RSUs held by Capella non-employee directors will vest in full immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger.

        The following table sets forth, for each of Capella's directors and executive officers (including two former directors who are required
by SEC rules to be included), the number of shares of Capella common stock subject to vested and unvested Capella stock options and
Capella RSUs (including Mr. Gilligan's market stock unit award) held by the director or executive officer as of December 6, 2017, the
latest practicable date to determine such amounts before the filing of this joint proxy

statement/prospectus. Depending on when the closing date occurs, certain equity-based awards shown in the table may vest prior to the
closing date.

        As mentioned above, except with respect to unvested Capella RSUs held by Capella non-employee directors (which will vest in full
in connection with the merger), Capella equity awards will be converted into Strayer equity awards. The aggregate value of Capella equity
awards, assuming a price per share of Capella common stock equal to $82.37 (which is equal to the average closing price of a share of
Capella common stock on the NASDAQ over the first five business days following October 30, 2017, the date of the first public
announcement of entering into the merger agreement), held by Capella's executive officers and directors is $19,386,402 and $2,045,000,
respectively.

Senior Executive Severance Plan

        Capella's Senior Executive Severance Plan provides severance pay and other benefits to certain eligible employees, including each of
Capella's executive officers.

        Under the Senior Executive Severance Plan, in the event there is a change in control (which would include the merger), and the
executive experiences a voluntary termination of employment for good reason or an involuntary termination other than for cause, in either
case within 24 months following the change in control, the executive will be eligible to receive the following (subject to the executive's
timely execution and non-revocation of a release of claims):

• Cash severance pay equal to the sum of 24 months of the executive's base salary and two times the executive's target bonus
for the year of termination; 

• Outplacement assistance for up to twelve (12) months; and 

• Capella-subsidized continuation coverage under Capella's health, dental and life insurance benefit plans for up to eighteen
(18) months.

        Cash severance benefits that may be due under the Senior Executive Severance Plan are calculated based on the greater of the
executive's base salary and targeted annual bonus, as applicable, in effect immediately prior to the closing of the change in control or the
date of the executive's termination of employment.

Table of Contents

        For purposes of the Senior Executive Severance Plan, "good reason" means (i) the material reduction of the executive's job
responsibilities upon or after a change in control; (ii) the material diminution of the executive's base compensation; or (iii) a reassignment
of the executive's principal place of work, without the executive's consent, to a location more than 50 miles from the executive's principal
place of work upon or after a change in control.

        For purposes of the Senior Executive Severance Plan, "cause" means the executive's (i) commission of a crime or other act that could
materially damage the reputation of Capella; (ii) theft, misappropriation or embezzlement of Capella property; (iii) falsification of records
maintained by Capella; (iv) failure substantially to comply with the written policies and procedures of Capella as they may be published or
revised from time to time (in writing, on the Faculty Center website, or on the Stella intranet); (v) misconduct directed toward learners,
employees or adjunct faculty; or (vi) failure substantially to perform the material duties of the executive's employment, which failure is not
cured within 30 days after written notice from Capella specifying the act of non-performance.

        For an estimate of the value of the payments and benefits described above that would become payable under the Senior Executive
Severance Plan to Messrs. Gilligan, Polacek, Ramstad and Watt and Ms. Jackson, see "Capella Proposals—Capella Proposal 3: The
Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal—Compensation Tables Required by Item 402(t)" above. The aggregate value of the payments
and benefits that would become payable to Dr. Senese, Capella's other executive officer, assuming that the effective time is December 6,
2017 and Dr. Senese experienced a termination without "cause" or resignation with "good reason" on such date, is $883,011. This estimate
is based on compensation and benefit levels that are in effect on December 6, 2017. Therefore, if compensation and benefit levels are
changed after such date, the actual value of Dr. Senese's severance payments and benefits may be different from those provided for above.

J. Kevin Gilligan Employment Agreement

        Under the terms of Capella's employment agreement with Mr. Gilligan, in the event of Mr. Gilligan's involuntary termination of
employment without cause, as defined in the Senior Executive Severance Plan, the severance payable to Mr. Gilligan will be not less than
an amount equal to three times Mr. Gilligan's annualized base salary in effect immediately prior to the date of termination of Mr. Gilligan's
employment.

J. Kevin Gilligan Strategic Transformation Award

        Under the terms of Mr. Gilligan's market stock unit award, in the event of a change in control (which would include the merger), if
Mr. Gilligan's employment is terminated without cause or he resigns for good reason, in either case within three years following the
change in control, then the award will vest in full. As the merger is not expected to be consummated until the third quarter of 2018, this
award is expected to vest pursuant to its terms prior to the expected closing date of the merger.

        For purposes of Mr. Gilligan's market stock award, "good reason" is defined as a material demotion or material reduction of the job
responsibilities of Mr. Gilligan or the reassignment without Mr. Gilligan's consent, of Mr. Gilligan's place of work to a location more than
50 miles from Mr. Gilligan's place of work immediately prior to the change in control, provided that none of these conditions shall
constitute "good reason" unless Mr. Gilligan first gives written notice to Capella within 90 days of the first occurrence of the condition,
delineating the claimed breach and setting forth Mr. Gilligan's intention to terminate Mr. Gilligan's employment if such breach is not duly
remedied within 30 business days, and Capella fails to cure the condition within such 30-day period. For purposes

Table of Contents

of Mr. Gilligan's market stock award, "cause" has the same meaning as set forth in Capella's 2005 Stock Incentive Plan.

Annual Management Incentive/Long-Term Performance Cash Programs

        Under the terms of Capella's annual management incentive program, in the event an executive's employment terminates due to an
involuntary termination without "cause" (as defined in the Senior Executive Severance Plan) during the performance period, the executive
will be eligible to receive a prorated portion of the final calculated payment under the program in a single lump sum cash payment when
payments are made to other participants following the end of the performance period.

        Under the terms of Capella's long-term performance cash programs, in the event of a change in control, the executive will be eligible
to receive a pro-rata lump sum cash payment, based on actual achieved performance for the truncated performance cycle, which will be
calculated immediately prior to the closing date. Payments under Capella's long-term performance cash programs will be made in a single
lump sum cash payment within 75 days following the closing date.

        For an estimate of the value of the payments described above that would become payable to Messrs. Gilligan, Polacek, Ramstad and
Watt and Ms. Jackson under Capella's annual management incentive program and long-term performance cash programs, see "Capella
Proposals—Capella Proposal 3: The Capella Advisory Compensation Proposal—Compensation Tables Required by Item 402(t)" above.
The value of the payment that would become payable to Dr. Senese under Capella's annual management incentive program, assuming that
the effective time is December 6, 2017 and Dr. Senese experienced a termination without "cause" on such date, is $93,582. The value of
the payment that would become payable to Dr. Senese under Capella's long-term performance cash programs, assuming that the effective
time is December 6, 2017 is $28,011. Both estimates assume the actual achievement of performance goals through December 6, 2017
applicable to each award.

Equity Plans

        Awards granted under the Capella 2014 Equity Incentive Plan generally will vest in full upon a termination of employment without
cause within two years following a change in control. Awards granted under the Capella 2005 Stock Incentive Plan will vest in full upon a
termination without "cause" or for "good reason" within three years following a change in control.

        For purposes of the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, "cause" means (i) the executive's failure or refusal substantially to perform the
executive's duties to the full extent of the executive's abilities for reasons other than death or disability, after written notice to the executive
of such failure or refusal providing the executive 30 days to take corrective action; (ii) conviction of a felony crime, or commission of any
act, the conviction for which would be a felony conviction; (iii) theft or misappropriation of Capella's property; or (iv) knowingly making
a material false written statement to the Capella board of directors regarding the affairs of Capella. For purposes of the agreements under
the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, "good reason" means the demotion or reduction of the job responsibilities of the executive or the
reassignment, without the executive's consent, of the executive's place of work to a location more than 50 miles from his or her place of
work immediately prior to the change in control.

        For purposes of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, "good reason" means the occurrence of one or more of the following events, so long
as the executive provided written notice to Capella of the event not later than 30 days after it occurred and the condition resulting from the
event has not been remedied by Capella within 30 days after its receipt of such notice: (i) a material reduction of the executive's job
responsibilities upon or after the change in control; (ii) a material diminution of the executive's base compensation; or (iii) a reassignment
of the executive's principal place of work, without the executive's consent, to a location more than 50 miles from the executive's principal
place of work upon or after the change in control. For purposes of the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, "cause"

means what the term is expressly defined to mean in a then-effective written agreement (including an award agreement issued pursuant to
the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan) between the executive and Capella or any affiliate, or in the absence of any such then-effective agreement
or definition means (i) the executive's failure or refusal substantially to perform the executive's duties to the full extent of the executive's
abilities for reasons other than death or disability, after written notice to the executive of such failure or refusal providing the executive
30 days to take corrective action; (ii) conviction of a felony crime, or commission of any act, the conviction for which would be a felony
conviction; (iii) theft or misappropriation of Capella's property; or (iv) knowingly making a material false written statement to the Capella
board of directors regarding the affairs of Capella.

        On December 7, 2017, the compensation committee of the Capella board of directors approved accelerated vesting of certain equity
awards held by Ms. Jackson and Messrs. Ramstad and Watt to facilitate tax planning strategies for Capella and these individuals. As part
of the same tax planning strategies, the compensation committee of the Capella board of directors also approved a payout of Ms. Jackson's
annual cash incentive award for fiscal 2017 and her long-term performance cash awards for 2015-2017 and 2016-2018, by paying out 90%
of the currently anticipated payout of her annual cash incentive award and her 2015-2017 long-term performance cash award and 80% of
her 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 long-term performance cash awards, with the anticipated performance of the long-term performance cash
awards projected as of June 30, 2018.

J. Kevin Gilligan and Steven L. Polacek Transition Agreements

        In connection with the merger, Capella entered into transition agreements with each of Messrs. Gilligan and Polacek. The agreements
set forth the compensatory terms for Messrs. Gilligan and Polacek's continued service with the combined company. The agreements
provide that Messrs. Gilligan and Polacek will continue as employees of Capella for twelve (12) months following the consummation of
the merger, which may be extended for up to an additional six (6) months upon the agreement of the parties, or an earlier mutually agreed
upon date. During this transition period, Mr. Gilligan will have the title of Vice Chairman and will serve on the combined company board
of directors and Mr. Polacek will have the title of Chief Integration Officer. The agreements provide that Mr. Gilligan's base salary and
target annual bonus amount for his continued service in such capacity will be $700,000 and 125% of base salary, respectively, and
Mr. Polacek's base salary and target annual bonus amount for his continued service in such capacity will be $400,000 and 75% of base
salary, respectively. Under the agreements, Messrs. Gilligan and Polacek also agree to provide certain ongoing transition assistance and to
comply with certain confidentiality, non-compete and non-solicitation covenants.

        The agreements also provide that upon Messrs. Gilligan and Polacek's termination of employment for any reason other than for
"cause" (as defined in the Senior Executive Severance Plan), including due to their voluntary resignation, and subject to and conditioned
upon the executive's execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims against Capella, Strayer and their subsidiaries and
affiliates, each of Messrs. Gilligan and Polacek will be entitled to receive the payments and benefits afforded to them pursuant to the
Senior Executive Severance Plan, the Capella 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (and any applicable award
agreements thereunder), and, in the case of Mr. Gilligan, his employment agreement with Capella.

Andrew E. Watt Letter Agreement

        In connection with the merger, Capella entered into a letter agreement with Andrew E. Watt, which provides that if Mr. Watt remains
employed for eighteen (18) months following the consummation of the merger, and agrees to waive any rights Mr. Watt may have to resign
for "good reason" (as defined in the Senior Executive Severance Plan) as a result of any reduction in Mr. Watt's job responsibilities, he will
have the right to terminate his employment other than for good reason,

effective at any time from the date that is eighteen (18) months following the consummation of the merger until the second annual
anniversary of the consummation of the merger, and will receive severance benefits pursuant to the Senior Executive Severance Plan equal
to the benefits Mr. Watt would have received under that plan if Mr. Watt had terminated employment for good reason immediately
following the consummation of the merger.

Employee Benefits

        The merger agreement requires Strayer (or the surviving corporation of any subsidiary thereof) to continue to provide certain
compensation and benefits for at least a period of one (1) year following the closing date, as well as take certain actions in respect of
employee benefits provided to Capella employees, including its executive officers. For a detailed description of these requirements, please
see the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Employee Matters" beginning on page 134.

Interests of Strayer's Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger 

        Strayer's directors and executive officers will not receive any special compensation the payment of which is contingent upon
consummation of the merger. Nevertheless, Strayer's directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different
from Strayer stockholders generally because Strayer's directors and executive officers may continue employment or service with Strayer
following the effective time and will be eligible to receive compensation and benefits consistent with their position and duties to Strayer.
Additionally, certain of Strayer's executive officers may receive compensation under Strayer's executive compensation programs
attributable to additional responsibilities in connection with the merger and subsequent integration process. Further, Strayer's directors and
executive officers will continue to receive indemnification and insurance under Strayer's policies currently in effect. Any compensation
and benefits that may be received by Strayer's directors and executive officers will be granted and paid pursuant to Strayer's director and
executive officer compensation programs, which are described in further detail in Strayer's Definitive Proxy Statement for its 2017 Annual
Meeting of Shareholders, filed with the SEC on March 16, 2017, portions of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Board Service Following the Merger

        Prior to the consummation of the merger, the Strayer board of directors will appoint the members of the board of directors of the
combined company, which will consist of (a) nine directors designated by Strayer, (b) J. Kevin Gilligan, Chief Executive Officer of
Capella, and (c) two additional designees who are currently members of the Capella board of directors and are recommended by
Mr. Gilligan, as described in more detail in the section entitled "The Merger Agreement—Post-Closing Governance."

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger 

United States Antitrust

        Under the HSR Act, the merger cannot be consummated until, among other things, notifications have been given and certain
information has been furnished to the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and all applicable waiting periods have expired or been
terminated.

        The Antitrust Division of the DOJ, the FTC and others may challenge the combination on antitrust grounds even after termination of
the waiting period. At any time before or after the consummation of the merger, any of the Antitrust Division of the DOJ, the FTC or
another person could take action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without
limitation, seeking to enjoin the consummation of the merger, seeking a rescission or other unwinding of the combination, or permitting
consummation subject to regulatory concessions or

Table of Contents

conditions. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the combination will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, it will not
succeed.

        On November 9, 2017, each of Capella and Strayer filed a Pre-Merger Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with
the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and the FTC, and on November 22, 2017, the FTC granted early termination, effective immediately, of
the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act.

Education Regulatory Approvals

        The merger agreement provides that the merger is conditioned upon receipt of regulatory approval from the DOE and the HLC, which
is the institutional accreditor for Capella University, and from certain state agencies. In addition, Strayer is notifying all of the educational
regulatory agencies that approve Strayer University of the merger. Although it is not expected that the merger constitutes a change of
control for Strayer University that would require approval of any such agency, it is possible that some of those agencies may require
approval of the merger or subject Strayer University to a review in connection with the merger. Capella and Strayer have begun the
process of notifying their respective regulatory agencies of the merger and, as appropriate, seeking required approvals, and will continue to
take all necessary actions required by their respective regulatory agencies prior to consummation of the merger.

        The merger agreement requires that the parties cooperate to submit a pre-acquisition review application to the DOE with respect to
Capella University no later than thirty (30) days after the date of the merger agreement, and to submit an application to the HLC no later
than December 1, 2017. On November 28, 2017, Capella submitted a pre-acquisition review application to the DOE, and on December 1,
2017, Capella filed a change of control application with the HLC. As a condition of the merger, Capella must receive from the DOE a
written response to its preacquisition review application that does not indicate the existence of any impediment to the issuance of the
temporary provisional program participation agreement following consummation of the merger that would reasonably be expected to result
in a combined company material adverse effect, or any terms or conditions that would reasonably be expected to result in a combined
company material adverse effect, as described in the merger agreement. See "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Consummation of the
Merger" beginning on page 121. In addition, required pre-closing approvals from certain other regulatory agencies may be required as a
condition of consummation of the merger, and those approvals cannot be subject to conditions that would reasonably be expected to result
in a combined company material adverse effect. Certain other regulatory agencies may require approval or notification of the merger after
the consummation of the merger, but must not provide any indication prior to consummation of the merger that either (i) such approval
will not be granted or (ii) that such approval will be granted with terms or conditions that would reasonably be expected to result in a
combined company material adverse effect.

        There can be no assurance that all of the regulatory approvals described above, or any other regulatory approvals that might be
required to consummate the merger, will be obtained and, if obtained, there can be no assurance as to the timing of any approvals, ability
to obtain the approvals on satisfactory terms, or that the conditions will not result in the abandonment of the merger. See the section of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled "The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Consummation of the Merger" beginning on page 121.

Accounting Treatment 

        The combined company will account for the merger using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with GAAP. GAAP
requires that one of Strayer or Capella be designated as the acquirer for accounting purposes based on the evidence available. Strayer will
be treated as the acquiring entity

114



9/24/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1104349/000104746917007568/a2234017zdefm14a.htm

Table of Contents

for accounting purposes. In identifying Strayer as the acquiring entity, the combined company took into account the structure of the
merger, the composition of the combined company board of directors and the designation of certain senior management positions of the
combined company. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Strayer will become the historical financial statements of the
combined company.

        The combined company will measure Capella's assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values, including net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as of the consummation of the merger. Any excess of the purchase price
over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill.

        Definite lived intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and
goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually. All intangible assets and goodwill are also tested for
impairment when certain indicators are present.

        The allocation of purchase price reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements is based on preliminary estimates
using assumptions Strayer management believes are reasonable based on currently available information. The final purchase price and fair
value assessment of assets and liabilities will be based in part on a detailed valuation that has not yet been completed.

Listing of Combined Company Shares 

        The merger agreement obligates Strayer to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the combined company shares to be issued in
connection with the merger (including combined company shares to be issued upon exercise or vesting, as applicable, of Strayer equity
awards) to be listed on NASDAQ (or such other stock exchange as may be mutually agreed upon by Capella and Strayer), subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the effective time. Approval for listing on NASDAQ of the combined company shares issuable to
Capella shareholders in connection with the merger, subject to official notice of issuance, is a condition to the obligations of Capella,
Strayer and Merger Sub to consummate the merger. It is expected that, following the merger, the combined company shares will be listed
on NASDAQ and trade under the symbol "STRA."

Delisting and Deregistration of Capella Common Stock 

        Following the merger, shares of Capella common stock will be delisted from NASDAQ, deregistered under the Exchange Act and
cease to be publicly traded.

Litigation Relating to the Merger 

        On November 30, 2017, a Capella shareholder (the "Plaintiff") filed a putative class action against Capella, Strayer, Merger Sub, and
the members of Capella's board of directors (the "Defendants") challenging the disclosures made in connection with the merger. The
lawsuit is styled Adam Franchi v. Capella Education Company, et al., No. 0:17-cv-05288-JRT-DTS, and was filed in the United States
District Court for the District of Minnesota.

        The Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that the Registration Statement filed in connection with the merger fails to disclose certain allegedly
material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 promulgated
thereunder. The alleged omissions relate to (i) certain financial projections by the companies and certain financial analyses performed by
Capella's financial advisor; and (ii) certain alleged potential conflicts of interest of Capella's officers and directors. The Plaintiff seeks to
enjoin Defendants from proceeding with the merger and seeks damages in the event the transaction is consummated. The Plaintiff also
seeks attorney's fees.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES 

        The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. Holders of shares of
Capella common stock that exchange their shares of Capella common stock for combined company shares in the merger. This discussion is
based on the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial and administrative authorities, rulings and decisions, all
as in effect as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus. These authorities may change, possibly with retroactive effect, and any
such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion. This discussion assumes that the merger will be consummated in accordance with
the merger agreement and as further described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This discussion is not a complete description of all
of the tax consequences of the merger and, in particular, does not address any tax consequences arising under the unearned income
Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, nor does it address any tax consequences
arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction, or under any U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the income
tax.

        This discussion applies only to U.S. Holders of shares of Capella common stock who hold such shares as a capital asset within the
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not purport to address all
aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to U.S. Holders of shares of Capella common stock in light of their particular
circumstances and does not apply to U.S. Holders of shares of Capella common stock subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal
income tax laws (such as, for example, banks and other financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, partnerships, S corporations or
other pass-through entities (or investors in partnerships, S corporations or other pass-through entities), regulated investment companies,
real estate investment trusts, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, insurance companies, mutual funds,
dealers or brokers in stocks and securities, commodities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to apply a mark-to-market method of
accounting, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, holders who acquired shares of Capella common stock pursuant to the exercise
of employee stock options, through a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation, holders who actually or constructively
own more than 5% of the outstanding stock of Capella, persons that are not U.S. Holders, U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not
the U.S. dollar, holders who hold shares of Capella common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other
integrated transaction, or United States expatriates).

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of shares of Capella common stock, as applicable,
that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation, or entity treated as
a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia, (iii) a trust if (a) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and
one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (b) such trust has made a valid election to be
treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (iv) an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax
regardless of its source.

        If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of Capella common stock, the
tax treatment of a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Any
entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes that holds shares of Capella common stock and any partners in such
partnership should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the merger to them.

        ALL HOLDERS OF SHARES OF CAPELLA COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS AS
TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE MERGER, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND
EFFECT OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger to U.S. Holders of Capella Common Stock 

        It is a condition to Strayer's obligation to consummate the merger that Strayer receive an opinion from its tax counsel, dated as of the
closing date, to the effect that the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. It is a
condition to Capella's obligation to consummate the merger that Capella receive an opinion from its tax counsel, dated as of the closing
date, to the effect that the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

        These opinions will be based on customary assumptions and representations from Strayer and Capella, as well as certain covenants
and undertakings by Strayer, Capella and Merger Sub (collectively, the "tax opinion representations and assumptions"). If any of the tax
opinion representations and assumptions is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or is violated, the validity of the opinions described above
may be affected and the tax consequences of the merger could differ from those described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        An opinion of counsel represents counsel's best legal judgment but is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or any
court, and there can be no certainty that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or that a court would not
sustain such a challenge. Neither Strayer nor Capella intends to obtain a ruling from the IRS with respect to the tax consequences of the
merger. If the IRS were to successfully challenge the "reorganization" status of the merger, the tax consequences would differ from those
described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

        Accordingly, on the basis of the opinions described above:

• a U.S. Holder of shares of Capella common stock generally will not recognize any gain or loss upon the exchange of shares
of Capella common stock for combined company shares in the merger, except with respect to cash received in lieu of
fractional shares (as discussed below); 

• a U.S. Holder of shares of Capella common stock will have a tax basis in the combined company shares received in the
merger (including fractional shares deemed received and redeemed as described below) equal to the tax basis of the shares
of Capella common stock surrendered in exchange therefor; 

• a U.S. Holder of shares of Capella common stock will have a holding period for the combined company shares received in
the merger (including fractional shares deemed received and redeemed as described below) that includes its holding period
for its shares of Capella common stock surrendered in exchange therefor; and 

• if a U.S. Holder of shares of Capella common stock acquired different blocks of shares of Capella common stock at
different times or at different prices, the combined company shares received in the merger (including fractional shares
deemed received and redeemed as described below) will be allocated pro rata to each block of shares of Capella common
stock, and the basis and holding period of such combined company shares will be determined on a block-for-block
approach depending on the basis and holding period of each block of shares of Capella common stock exchanged for such
combined company shares.

Table of Contents

Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares

        A U.S. Holder that receives cash in lieu of a combined company fractional share generally will be treated as having received such
fractional share and then as having received such cash in redemption of the fractional share. Gain or loss generally will be recognized
based on the difference between the amount of cash received in lieu of the combined company fractional share and the portion of the U.S.
Holder's aggregate adjusted tax basis in the combined company shares surrendered which is allocable to the combined company fractional
share. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's holding period for its shares of Capella
common stock exceeds one (1) year at the effective time.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

        A U.S. Holder (other than certain exempt U.S. Holders) that receives cash in lieu of a combined company fractional share may be
subject to backup withholding (currently at a 28% rate) unless such U.S. Holder provides its correct taxpayer identification number and
certifies as to exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding
rules. A U.S. Holder that does not provide its correct taxpayer identification number may also be subject to penalties imposed by the IRS.
Amounts withheld, if any, under the backup withholding rules are generally not an additional tax and may be refunded or credited against
the U.S. Holder's federal income tax liability, provided the U.S. Holder timely furnishes the required information to the IRS.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT 

        The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the merger agreement. This summary may not contain all the
information about the merger agreement that is important to you. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger
agreement attached as Annex A to, and incorporated by reference into, this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You are encouraged to read
the merger agreement in its entirety because it is the legal document that governs the merger.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement and the Summary of the Merger Agreement 

        The merger agreement and the summary of its terms in this joint proxy statement/prospectus have been included to provide
information about the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. The terms and information in the merger agreement are not intended
to provide any other public disclosure of factual information about Capella, Strayer or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. The
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the merger agreement are made by Strayer, Capella and Merger Sub
only for the purposes of the merger agreement and are qualified and subject to certain limitations and exceptions agreed to by Strayer,
Capella and Merger Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger agreement, including being qualified by reference to
confidential disclosures. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and
described in this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were made solely for the benefit of the
parties to the merger agreement and were negotiated for the purpose of allocating contractual risk among the parties to the merger
agreement rather than to establish matters as facts. The representations and warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of
materiality or material adverse effect different from those generally applicable to stockholders and reports and documents filed with the
SEC including being qualified by reference to confidential disclosures. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations and warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, may have
changed since the date of the merger agreement.

        For the foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements and any descriptions of those provisions should
not be read alone or relied upon as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Strayer, Capella or any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates. Instead, such provisions or descriptions should be read only in conjunction with the other information provided
elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Structure of the Merger 

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Capella, with Capella surviving as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Strayer.

Consummation and Effectiveness of the Merger 

        Unless the parties agree otherwise, the consummation of the merger will occur within three (3) business days after all conditions to
the consummation of the merger described under "—Conditions to Consummation of the Merger" have been satisfied or waived; provided
that if such date would make it reasonably unlikely for the parties to either (a) comply with any laws applicable on a post-closing basis in
order to obtain any Educational Consent or (b) satisfy conditions under applicable DOE regulations for continuing the effectiveness of any
TPPPA, the consummation of the merger will take place on the first (1st) business day of the immediately following month, without regard
to the outside date. The merger will be consummated and become effective at the time the articles of merger are duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota, or such later time as agreed to by Strayer and Capella and specified in the articles of merger.

Post-Closing Governance 

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, effective at the effective time, unless otherwise agreed by Strayer and Capella in writing, the
Strayer board of directors is required to take all necessary action to increase the size of the combined company board of directors to twelve
(12) directors in order to appoint, as of the effective time, nine (9) directors to be designated by Strayer and three (3) directors to be
designated by Capella (such designees of Capella, the "Additional Board Designees"). The Additional Board Designees will consist of
(i) the chief executive officer of Capella as of the date of the merger agreement and (ii) two (2) additional designees (or, if item (i) is not
applicable, three (3) designees) who are currently members of the Capella board of directors and recommended by the chief executive
officer of Capella or the Capella board of directors (if item (i) is not applicable) to the Strayer board of directors and the nominating and
corporate governance committee of the Strayer board of directors for approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.

        Effective at the effective time, unless otherwise agreed by Strayer and Capella in writing, Strayer will take all necessary action to
cause (i) Robert S. Silberman to continue as executive chairman of the combined company board of directors, (ii) J. Kevin Gilligan to be
appointed to act as the vice chairman of the combined company board of directors, (iii) Karl McDonnell to continue as President and Chief
Executive Officer of the combined company, (iv) Steven L. Polacek to be appointed as the Chief Integration/Transition Officer of the
combined company and (v) one Additional Board Designee to be appointed to the compensation committee of the combined company
board of directors. The Strayer board of directors will nominate the Additional Board Designees for election at (i) if the effective time is
prior to the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, then the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders or (ii) if the effective time is after the 2018
annual meeting of stockholders, then the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.

Merger Consideration 

        At the effective time, each Capella share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares held in
treasury or held by Strayer, Capella or Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to
receive 0.875 of a newly-issued combined company share. No fractional combined company shares will be issued in the merger, and
Capella shareholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares as part of the merger consideration, as specified in the merger agreement.

No Dissenters' Rights; No Appraisal Rights 

        Under Minnesota law and the Capella articles of incorporation, Capella shareholders will not be entitled to exercise any dissenters'
rights in connection with the merger.

        Under Maryland law, Strayer stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger or the Strayer
Required Proposals.

Procedures for Surrendering Capella Stock Certificates 

        Prior to the dissemination of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to the Capella shareholders and Strayer stockholders, Strayer has
agreed to appoint its transfer agent to act as exchange agent to handle the exchange of Capella stock certificates or Capella book-entry
shares for the merger consideration. At or prior to the effective time, Strayer will deposit the combined company shares comprising the
aggregate merger consideration for the benefit of Capella shareholders. As promptly as practicable after the effective time (but in no event
later than five (5) business days thereafter), Strayer will cause the exchange agent to mail to each holder of record of Capella shares at the
effective time a letter of transmittal for the exchange and instructions explaining how to surrender Capella stock certificates or Capella
book-entry shares to the exchange agent.

Table of Contents

        Upon surrender of Capella stock certificates and Capella book-entry shares for cancellation to the exchange agent, and upon delivery
of a properly completed letter of transmittal with respect to such Capella stock certificates or Capella book-entry shares, Capella
shareholders will be entitled to receive the merger consideration for each Capella share formerly represented by such Capella stock
certificates and for each Capella book-entry share.

Treatment of Capella Equity Awards 

Capella Stock Options

        Each Capella stock option that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (whether vested or unvested) and held by a
continuing employee or director of Capella will automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be assumed by
Strayer and be converted into a Strayer stock option to acquire shares of Strayer common stock on the same terms and conditions as the
Capella stock option to which it relates, equal to the product of the merger exchange ratio of 0.875 multiplied by the number of shares of
Capella common stock subject to the option (rounded down to the nearest whole share), and will have an exercise price per share equal to
the quotient obtained by dividing the exercise price per share of Capella common stock by the merger exchange ratio of 0.875 (rounded up
to the nearest whole cent). Capella stock options that are outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the consummation of the
merger and held by former employees, directors or consultants of Capella will automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the product of (i) the amount of merger
consideration (if any) that the holder of such Capella stock option would have received had the Capella stock option been exercised
immediately prior to the effective time for shares of Capella common stock (net of the applicable exercise price), and (ii) the VWAP of
Strayer common stock for the ten (10) trading day period ending on the second to last trading day prior to the effective time. Capella stock
options that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time and held by current Capella directors who will not continue as
members of the Strayer board of directors following effective time will automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration that the holder of such Capella stock option would
have been entitled to receive if the Capella stock option had been exercised for shares of Capella common stock immediately prior to the
effective time (net of the applicable exercise price).

Capella Restricted Stock Unit Awards

        All Capella RSUs that are outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the merger will be assumed by Strayer and will be
converted into awards of Strayer RSUs and will continue to have, and will be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the
Capella RSUs immediately prior to the effective time, with appropriate adjustments in the number of shares of Strayer common stock
subject to the Strayer RSU to reflect the merger exchange ratio. In addition, outstanding Capella RSUs granted to Capella directors under
the Capella equity plans will become fully and immediately vested upon the effective time.

Conditions to Consummation of the Merger 

        Mutual Conditions to Consummation.    The obligations of Capella, Strayer and Merger Sub to consummate the merger are subject

Definition of "Material Adverse Effect" 

        Many of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by "material adverse effect" on the party making
such representations and warranties.

        For purposes of the merger agreement, "material adverse effect" means, with respect to Strayer or Capella, as the case may be, any
change, event, development, condition, occurrence or effect that is, or would reasonably be expected to (x) be, materially adverse to the
business, condition (financial or otherwise), assets, liabilities or results of operations of that party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or
(y) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; provided, however, that, in
the case of clause (x), none of the following shall be deemed in themselves, either alone or in combination, to constitute, and none of the
following shall be taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a material adverse effect: (i) any changes resulting
from general market, economic, financial, capital markets or political or regulatory conditions in the United States, (ii) any changes of law
or GAAP (or, in each case, any authoritative interpretations thereof), (iii) any changes resulting from any act of terrorism, war, national or
international calamity, or any worsening thereof, (iv) any changes generally affecting the industries in which that party and its subsidiaries
conduct their businesses, including the post-secondary or proprietary education industry, (v) any changes resulting from the execution of
the merger agreement or the announcement or the pendency of the merger, including any loss of employees or customers, any cancellation
of or delay in customer orders or any disruption in or termination of (or loss of or other negative effect or change with respect to)
customer, supplier, distributor or similar business relationships or partnerships resulting from the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement (provided that the exception in this clause (v) shall not apply to certain representations and warranties of the merger
agreement), (vi) changes in that party's stock price or the trading volume of that party's stock or any change in the credit rating of that
party (but not, in each case, the underlying cause of any such changes, unless such underlying cause would otherwise be excepted from
this definition), (vii) any changes or effects resulting from any action required to be taken by the terms of the merger agreement, (viii) the
failure to meet internal or analysts' expectations, projections or results of operations (but not, in each case, the underlying cause of any
such changes, unless such underlying cause would otherwise be excepted from this definition) or (ix) any litigation relating to the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; provided, that in the case of items (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), if and only to the extent such
changes do not have a disproportionate impact on that party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other participants in the
industries in which that party and its subsidiaries conduct their businesses.

Definition of "Combined Company Material Adverse Effect" 

        Certain conditions to consummation of the merger are qualified by "combined company material adverse effect."

        For purposes of the merger agreement "combined company material adverse effect" means any change, event, development,
condition, occurrence or effect that is, or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the business, condition (financial or
otherwise), assets, liabilities or results of operations of Capella and Strayer and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided,
however that, none of the following shall be deemed in themselves, either alone or in combination, to constitute, and none of the following
shall be taken into account in determining whether there has been or will be, a combined company material adverse effect: (i) any changes
resulting from general market, economic, financial, capital markets or political or regulatory (other than educational regulatory) conditions
in the United States, (ii) any changes of GAAP (or, in each case, any authoritative interpretations thereof) or (iii) any non-regulatory
changes generally affecting the industries in which Capella or Strayer and their respective subsidiaries conduct their businesses, including
the post-secondary or proprietary education industry; provided, that in the case of items (i), (ii) and (iii), if and only to the extent such
changes do not have a disproportionate impact on Capella or Strayer and their respective subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to
other participants in the industries in which Capella or Strayer and their respective subsidiaries conduct their businesses.

Conduct of Business Pending the Merger 

        In general, except as may be required by applicable law, stock exchange requirement or any educational agency and except as set
forth in the confidential disclosure letter delivered to the other party concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement of each party
or as otherwise expressly contemplated by the merger agreement, unless the other party otherwise consents in writing (which consent may
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Strayer, Capella and their respective subsidiaries are required to (i) conduct their
operations only in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) use their reasonable best efforts to keep available the
services of their respective current officers, employees and consultants and to preserve the goodwill and current relationships with their
respective students, customers, suppliers and other persons with which they have material business relations, and (iii) use their reasonable
best efforts to preserve intact their respective business organization (including their respective material assets and properties) and comply
with all applicable laws.

        Without limiting the foregoing, except as may be required by applicable law, stock exchange requirement or any educational agency,
set forth in Strayer's or Capella's confidential disclosure letter or as otherwise expressly contemplated in the merger agreement, each of
Strayer and Capella and each of their respective subsidiaries is not permitted to, between the date of the merger agreement and the
effective time, take any of the following actions without the prior written consent of Capella, in the case of actions taken by Strayer, or

organizational documents;

Obligations to Recommend the Approval of the Merger Agreement and the Approval of the Strayer Charter Amendment and the
Strayer Share Issuance 

        As discussed under "The Capella Special Meeting," Capella's board of directors recommends that Capella shareholders vote "FOR"
the Capella Merger Proposal ("Capella recommendation"). Capella's board of directors, however, may effect a Capella Adverse
Recommendation Change within the meaning of items (x), (y) and (z)(2) of the definition thereof, in each case under specified
circumstances as discussed under "—No Solicitation."

        Similarly, as discussed under "The Strayer Special Meeting," Strayer's board of directors recommends that Strayer stockholders vote
"FOR" the Share Issuance Proposal and the Charter Amendment Proposal ("Strayer recommendation"). Strayer's board of directors,
however, may effect a Strayer Adverse Recommendation Change within the meaning of items (x), (y) and (z)(2) of the definition thereof,
in each case under specified circumstances as discussed under "—No Solicitation."

No Solicitation 

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, subject to certain exceptions described below, each of Strayer and Capella has agreed, from
the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the effective time or the date, if any, of the termination of the merger agreement in
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, it shall not, and shall cause its respective subsidiaries and representatives not to,
directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or induce (including by way of furnishing information which has not been
previously publicly disseminated), or take any other action that could reasonably be expected to facilitate, any inquiries or
the making of any proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing Proposal; or 

• engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to obtaining the Strayer stockholder approval (in the case of Strayer) or the Capella
shareholder approval (in the case of Capella) and following the receipt of a bona fide written unsolicited Competing Proposal made after
the date of the merger agreement and the Strayer board of directors or the Capella board of directors, as applicable, determines in good
faith (after receiving advice of its financial advisor and of its outside legal counsel) is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal and that was not, directly or indirectly, solicited, initiated or knowingly encouraged in violation of the non-solicitation obligations
under the merger agreement, the Strayer board of directors or the Capella board of directors, as applicable, determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that a failure to take action with respect to such Competing Proposal, as applicable, would be
inconsistent with the directors' duties to Strayer under applicable law (in the case of the Strayer board of directors) or the directors'
fiduciary duties to Capella's shareholders under applicable law (in the case of the Capella board of directors), then Strayer or Capella may,
in response to such Competing Proposal, as applicable, and subject to compliance with the non-solicitation obligations under the merger
agreement, (A) furnish information with respect to Strayer or Capella, as applicable, to the person making such Competing Proposal
pursuant to an acceptable confidentiality agreement, and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with such person regarding such
Competing Proposal.

        Each of Capella and Strayer has agreed that it shall not, and shall cause its respective subsidiaries and representatives not to, from and
after the date of the merger agreement until the earlier of the effective time or the date, if any, on which the merger agreement is
terminated pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, directly or indirectly:

Competing Proposal; 

• terminate, amend, release, modify or knowingly fail to enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or request
under, any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by the applicable party in respect of or in
contemplation of a Competing Proposal (other than to the extent the Capella board or the Strayer board, as applicable,
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take any of such actions would be
inconsistent with the directors' duties under applicable law); or 

• propose to do any of the foregoing.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to obtaining the Strayer stockholder approval (in the case of Strayer) or the Capella shareholder
approval (in the case of Capella) and following the receipt of a bona fide written Competing Proposal made after the date of the merger
agreement that was not, directly or indirectly, solicited, initiated or knowingly encouraged in violation of the non-solicitation obligations
under the merger agreement, the Strayer board or the Capella board, as applicable, may effect a Strayer Adverse Recommendation Change
within the meaning of items (x), (y) and (z)(2) of the definition thereof or a Capella Adverse Recommendation Change within the meaning
of items (x), (y) and (z)(2) of the definition thereof, as applicable or terminate the merger agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, but if and only if:

• the Strayer board of directors or the Capella board of directors, as applicable, concludes in good faith, after consultation
with Strayer's or Capella's outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal; 

• the Capella board of directors or the Strayer board of directors, as applicable, provides the other party five (5) business
days prior written notice of its intention to take such action (a "Competing Proposal Notice"); 

• during the five (5) business days following such written notice (the "Negotiation Period"), if requested by the other party,
the board of directors of the applicable party proposing to effect the recommendation change and its representatives have
negotiated in good faith with the other party regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions proposed by the other
party in response to such Competing Proposal; and 

• at the end of the Negotiation Period, the Strayer board of directors or Capella board of directors, as applicable, concludes in
good faith, after consultation with Strayer's or Capella's outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into
account any adjustment or modification of the terms of the merger agreement to which the other party has agreed in writing
to make to the terms of the transactions), that the Competing Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and, after
consultation with Strayer's or Capella's outside legal counsel, as applicable, that the failure to make such a Strayer Adverse
Recommendation Change or Capella Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, would be inconsistent with the
exercise, in the case of the Strayer board of directors, of the directors' duties to Strayer under applicable law or, in the case
of the Capella board of directors, of the directors' fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Capella under applicable law.

        Any material amendment or modification to any Competing Proposal shall require a new Competing Proposal Notice and the
Negotiation Period shall be extended by an additional three (3) business days from the date of receipt of such new Competing Proposal

financial and legal advisors, taking into account the various legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the Competing Proposal, including
the financing terms thereof, and the third party making such Competing Proposal in addition to such other factors as the Capella board of
directors or the Strayer board of directors, as applicable, considers to be appropriate, (A) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be

waivers from third parties, including under any contract to which Capella or Strayer or any of their respective subsidiaries is party or by
which such person or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, (ii) obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from governmental entities (including, without limitation, those in connection with the HSR
Act), make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with and take all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver
from, or to avoid any proceeding by, any governmental entity or educational agency (including, the pre-closing Educational Consents

with the HSR Act), and (iii) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the

arbitral or administrative) by or against any governmental entity or any educational agency. Each of the parties shall furnish to each other
party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

Indemnification Covenant 

        From and after the effective time, Strayer shall, and shall cause the surviving corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of Capella, Strayer and any of their respective subsidiaries (each, an "indemnitee" and,
collectively, the "indemnitees") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the effective time, including in connection with the
merger agreement or the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        For a period of no less than six (6) years from the effective time, Strayer shall cause the surviving corporation to, and the surviving
corporation shall, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the organizational
documents of Capella, Strayer or any of their respective subsidiaries in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, and shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who
immediately before the effective time were current or former directors or officers of Capella, Strayer or any of their respective
subsidiaries.

Employee Matters 

        To the extent permitted by applicable laws, Strayer shall credit each employee of Strayer, Capella or any of their respective
subsidiaries as of the consummation of the merger who continues employment with Strayer or the surviving corporation following the
closing date (each a "continuing employee") with his or her years of service with Strayer, Capella or any of their respective subsidiaries
and predecessor entities, under any employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements in which such continuing employee participates
following the consummation of the merger (the "post-closing plan"), to the same extent as such continuing employee was entitled
immediately prior to the consummation of the merger to credit for such service under any similar Strayer benefit plan or Capella benefit
plan, for purposes of eligibility for participation and vesting (but not accrual of benefits, other than for purposes of determining the level of
vacation, travel and/or severance benefits), except to the extent such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits.

        In addition, for purposes of each post-closing plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or other health benefits to
any continuing employee and his or her dependents, Strayer shall

(i) cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work requirements of
such post-closing plan to be waived for such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such waiting
periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work requirements were waived or were
inapplicable under the comparable Strayer benefit plan or Capella benefit plan, (ii) fully credit each continuing employee with all
deductible payments, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such continuing employee and his or her covered
dependents under the medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plans of Strayer or Capella (or their respective subsidiaries), as
applicable, prior to the consummation of the merger during the plan year in which the consummation of the merger occurs for the purpose
of determining the extent to which such continuing employee has satisfied the deductible, co-payments, or maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such continuing employee and his or her covered dependents for such plan year under any pre-closing plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or health benefits, as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such plan, and
(iii) credit the accounts of such continuing employees under any post-closing plan that is a flexible spending plan with any unused balance
in the account of such continuing employee under the applicable Strayer benefit plan or Capella benefit plan.

        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each continuing employee who satisfies the eligibility requirements of a Strayer
benefit plan or a Capella benefit plan that is a 401(k) plan shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan maintained by Strayer or the
surviving corporation following the consummation of the merger (each a "post-closing 401(k) plan") and shall be credited with eligibility
service and vesting service for all periods of service with Strayer and Capella, and their respective subsidiaries to the extent so credited
with such service under the applicable 401(k) plan as of the closing date. Additionally, in the event Strayer or any of its subsidiaries
freezes a 401(k) plan after the closing date, each continuing employee who participates in such frozen plan shall, following such action,
become eligible to participate in a post-closing 401(k) plan.

STRAYER AND CAPELLA UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements of the combined company (the "pro forma financial
statements") include the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet (the "pro forma balance sheet") as of September 30,
2017, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the nine months
ended September 30, 2017 (the "pro forma statements of income"), after giving effect to the merger.

        The pro forma statements of income combine the historical consolidated statements of income of Strayer and Capella, giving effect to
the merger as if it had occurred on January 1, 2016, the first (1st) day of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The pro forma balance
sheet as of September 30, 2017 combines the balance sheets of Strayer and Capella, giving effect to the merger as if it had occurred on
September 30, 2017.

        The pro forma financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. This historical financial
information has been adjusted in the pro forma financial statements to give effect to pro forma events that are (i) directly attributable to the
merger, (ii) factually supportable and (iii) with respect to the pro forma statements of income, expected to have a continuing impact on the
consolidated results of the combined company.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the
pro forma financial statements. In addition, the pro forma financial statements are based on, and should be read in conjunction with, the
following historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which are incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus:

• Separate historical consolidated financial statements of Strayer as of, and for the year ended and nine months ended,
December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively, and the related notes included in Strayer's Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and Strayer's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2016; and 

• Separate historical consolidated financial statements of Capella as of, and for the year ended and nine months ended,
December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively, and the related notes included in Capella's Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and Capella's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2016.

        The pro forma financial statements were prepared by Strayer using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, which are referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as GAAP. Strayer has been treated
as the acquirer in the merger for accounting purposes. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to the
underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, with any excess purchase
price allocated to goodwill.

        The pro forma purchase price allocation of Capella's assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed is based on preliminary
estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the pro forma financial statements are based upon currently
available information and certain assumptions that management of Strayer believes are factually supportable as of the date of this
registration statement. Before consummation of the merger, there are significant limitations under applicable law regarding what Strayer
can learn about Capella. A final determination of the fair value of Capella's assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including goodwill and
intangible assets, will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Capella that exist as of the closing date,
and this analysis is not yet finalized. As a result of the foregoing, the pro forma

adjustments are preliminary and are subject to change as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are
performed. These potential changes to the purchase price allocation and related pro forma adjustments could be material.

        The pro forma combined financial statements do not reflect any cost savings that may be realized as a result of the merger and also
does not reflect any restructuring or integration-related costs to achieve those potential cost savings. At this time, no material
intercompany transactions between Strayer and Capella during the periods presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial statements have been identified.

        The adjustments included in the pro forma financial statements are based upon currently available information and assumptions that
management of Strayer believes to be reasonable. These adjustments and related assumptions are described in the accompanying notes
presented on the following pages.

        The pro forma financial statements are not intended to represent or to be indicative of the actual results of operations or financial
position that the combined company would have reported had the merger been consummated as of the dates set forth in the pro forma
financial statements, and should not be taken as being indicative of the combined company's future consolidated results of operations or
financial position. The actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in the pro forma financial statements for a number of
reasons, including differences between the assumptions used to prepare the pro forma financial statements and actual amounts.

Table of Contents

1. Description of Transaction 

        On October 29, 2017, Strayer and Capella entered into the merger agreement. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Merger Sub will
merge with and into Capella, with Capella becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Strayer. In the merger, each share of common stock of
Capella will be converted into the right to receive 0.875 newly issued shares of common stock of Strayer (referred to as "combined
company shares" as of the consummation of and following the merger).

        Based on the closing price per share of Strayer common stock on NASDAQ on November 30, 2017, the latest practicable date before
the date of filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for the purposes of calculating the pro forma financial statements, the 0.875
combined company shares that the Capella shareholders will receive in respect of each share of Capella common stock would have an
aggregate value of approximately $1,009.3 million.

2. Basis of Presentation 

        The accompanying pro forma financial statements were prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X and present the pro
forma balance sheet and pro forma statements of income of Strayer based upon the historical financial statements of each of Strayer and
Capella, after giving effect to the merger, and are intended to reflect the impact of the merger on Strayer's consolidated financial
statements. The historical financial statements of Strayer and Capella have been adjusted in the accompanying pro forma financial
statements to give effect to pro forma events that are (i) directly attributable to the merger, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) with respect
to the statement of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results of operations of the combined company.

        The pro forma financial statements combine the statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the nine months
ended September 30, 2017 and the balance sheets as of September 30, 2017 of Strayer and Capella. The presentation of the pro forma
financial statements is consistent with how it is currently expected that the combined company will present its financial statements going
forward. The pro forma financial statements are consistent with Strayer's accounting policies disclosed in its quarterly and annual reports.
The process of conforming the accounting policies of Capella to those of Strayer is ongoing and, at the time of preparing the pro forma
financial statements, management is not aware of any material policy differences or necessary financial statement reclassifications other
than those identified below. Strayer management is currently conducting an in-depth review of Capella's accounting policies in an effort to
determine if additional differences in accounting policies and/or financial statement classification exist that may require additional
adjustments to or reclassification of Capella's results of operations, assets or liabilities to conform to Strayer's accounting policies and
classifications. As a result of that review, Strayer management may identify differences that, when conformed, could have a material
impact on the pro forma financial statements.

        For the purpose of preparing the pro forma financial statements, certain reclassifications were made relative to Strayer's and Capella's
historical financial statement line item presentations in order to conform with Regulation S-X, and to conform with that expected of the
combined company.

3. Estimation of Consideration Transferred and Assets to be Acquired and Liabilities to be Assumed 

        The following is a preliminary estimate of the consideration expected to be deemed to be transferred, assets to be deemed to be
acquired, and liabilities to be deemed assumed in the merger, reconciled to the estimate of total consideration expected to be transferred.
These preliminary amounts are based on Capella's balance sheet as of September 30, 2017 adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value of the
assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date.

(the closing share price of Strayer common stock on November 30, 2017). If the closing price is within ten percent of
the price used in the unaudited pro forma balance sheet, the value assigned to goodwill would be between
$587.3 million and $789.2 million.

At the effective time, any stock option or unvested restricted stock unit held by a Capella employee who remained
employed by Capella as of immediately prior to the merger will be converted into a stock-based compensation award
(the "Replacement Award") of the combined company and will be subject to the same terms and conditions after the
merger as the terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding Capella stock-based compensation award.
Accordingly, included in this balance is the estimated fair value of the Replacement Award issued to Capella
employees as of September 30, 2017. The estimated fair value of stock options was calculated using the Black-
Scholes-Merton model. In calculating the estimated fair value of such options, management used the following
weighted-average assumptions with respect to Strayer common stock:

As a result of the Transition Agreements entered into by two named executive officers of Capella, all outstanding
equity awards held by such executive officers are deemed to vest at closing and converted into merger consideration.
The value of the merger consideration to be issued in connection with such accelerated vesting has been included in
the total value to allocate.

(2) Goodwill has been calculated as the difference between the estimated acquisition date fair value of the total
consideration transferred and the aggregate values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill
is not amortized. 

(3) Identifiable intangible assets are required to be measured at fair value, and these acquired assets could include assets
that are not intended to be used or sold or that are intended to be used in a manner other than their highest and best
use. For purposes of these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and consistent with the
ASC 820 requirements for fair value measurements, it is assumed that all assets will be used, and that all acquired
assets will be used in a manner that represents the highest and best use of those acquired assets. 

The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is determined primarily using variations of the "income approach,"
which is based on the present value of the future after-tax cash flows attributable to each identifiable intangible asset.
Other valuation methods, including the market approach and cost approach, were also considered in estimating the
fair value.

DESCRIPTION OF COMBINED COMPANY SHARES 

        As a result of the merger and the other transactions described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Capella shareholders will
become stockholders of Strayer, which we refer to as the combined company after the merger. The rights of former Capella shareholders
and the rights of Strayer stockholders as stockholders of the combined company following the consummation of the merger will be
governed by the Strayer charter, as amended and restated in connection with the merger, and the Strayer bylaws. For more information
about the proposed amendments to the Strayer charter, see "Strayer Proposals." The following description of combined company shares is
a summary. This summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Strayer bylaws and to the
form of the amended and restated charter of the combined company that will become effective upon consummation of the merger, which is
attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and
to the applicable provisions of the MGCL. See also "Comparison of Stockholder Rights."

Authorized Shares of Stock of the Combined Company 

        The charter of the combined company will authorize the combined company to issue 32 million shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, which are referred to as the "combined company shares," and 8 million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
share.

        As of the close of business on December 6, 2017, the latest practicable date before the filing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
there were 11,167,425 shares of Strayer common stock outstanding (the holders of which are entitled to one vote per share on matters
voted on by Strayer stockholders).

        Upon the effective time, each Capella share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than shares held in
treasury or held by Strayer, Capella or Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) will be converted into the right to
receive 0.875 combined company shares (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares).

        We expect a total of approximately 10.5 million combined company shares to be issued to Capella shareholders in connection with
the merger. We expect that, immediately following the consummation of the merger, there will be a total of approximately 21.7 million
combined company shares outstanding.

Common Stock 

        The holders of combined company shares will have and possess all rights pertaining to the stock of the combined company, subject to
the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications or
terms and conditions of redemption of any class or series of preferred stock of the combined company that may in the future be issued with
any preference or priority over the common stock.

Voting

        Except as may be provided for under the terms of any class or series of preferred stock that may in the future be issued, the holders of
the combined company shares will have the sole power to vote for the election of directors and for all other purposes.

        No holder of combined company shares will have the right to cumulative voting in the election of directors of the combined company,
which means that holders of a majority of the combined company shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors can elect all
of the directors then standing for election and the holders of the remaining combined company shares will not be able to elect any
directors.

Table of Contents

        Under Maryland law, a corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, convert into another form of entity, sell all or
substantially all of its assets or engage in a statutory share exchange, unless declared advisable by the board of directors and approved by
stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. However, a Maryland corporation may provide
in its charter for approval of such matters by a lesser percentage, but not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the
matter. The charter of the combined company provides for approval of such matters by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast
a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.

Dividends

        Except as otherwise provided by law or under the terms of any class or series of preferred stock that may in the future be issued by
the combined company, the holders of combined company shares will be entitled to receive such dividends as from time to time may be
authorized by the board of directors of the combined company and declared by the combined company.

Liquidation

        In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the combined company, whether voluntary or involuntary, subject to the
rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding class or series of preferred stock, the holders of combined company shares will be entitled
to share ratably according to the number of shares held by them in all assets of the combined company available for distribution to its
stockholders.

Preemptive or Similar Rights

        Holders of combined company shares will not have preemptive rights, which means that they will not have an automatic option to
purchase any shares that the combined company may issue, or preference, conversion, sinking fund or redemption rights.

Preferred Stock 

        The amended and restated charter of the combined company authorizes the board of directors, without stockholder approval, to
classify (or reclassify) and issue one or more series of preferred stock and to set the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers,
restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of such shares. Because
the board of directors of the combined company has the power to establish the preferences and rights of each series of preferred stock, it
may afford the holders of any such series of preferred stock preferences, powers and rights that are senior to the rights of holders of
combined company shares. Holders of preferred stock are normally entitled to receive a preference payment, if the combined company
were to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, before any payment is made to holders of combined company shares.

Takeover Defense 

        Certain provisions of the charter and bylaws of the combined company and of the MGCL will have anti-takeover effects and could
delay, discourage, defer or prevent a tender offer or other takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in the stockholder's best
interests, including attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the combined company shares held by stockholders,
and may make removal of the incumbent management and directors more difficult.

Table of Contents

Authorized Shares

        The authorized but unissued combined company shares and preferred stock will be available for future issuance without stockholder
approval. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional
capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued combined company shares and
preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the combined company by means of a proxy
contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise.

        The board of directors of the combined company will have the sole authority to determine the terms of any one or more class or series
of preferred stock, including voting rights, dividend rates, conversion and redemption rights and liquidation preferences. As a result of the
ability to fix voting rights for a class or series of preferred stock, the board of directors of the combined company will have the power to
issue a class or series of preferred stock to persons friendly to management in order to attempt to block a tender offer, merger or other
transaction by which a third-party seeks control of the combined company, and thereby assist members of management to retain their
positions.

Requirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations

        The bylaws of the combined company establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination
of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors of the combined
company or a committee of the board of directors of the combined company.

Stockholder Meetings

        The bylaws of the combined company provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called for any purpose or purposes at
any time by the Chief Executive Officer of the combined company or the board of directors of the combined company. In addition, the
secretary of the combined company is required to call a special meeting upon the written request of a holder, or a group of holders, entitled
to cast at least 25% of the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting, subject to certain restrictions.

Action by Stockholders Without a Meeting

        Under Maryland law, in order for any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders of the combined
company to be taken without a meeting, a consent in writing or by electronic transmission setting forth the action so taken, must be given
by all of the stockholders of the combined company entitled to vote with respect to the matter thereof. The bylaws of the combined
company also require a waiver of any right to dissent from any stockholder would be entitled to notice of a stockholder meeting but is not
entitled to vote on the matter.

Other Matters 

Number of Directors

        The bylaws of the combined company provide that the size of the combined company's board of directors shall be up to 12 directors
or such other number as may be determined from time to time by a majority of the board of directors of the combined company. Prior to
the merger, the merger agreement requires the Strayer board of directors to take all action necessary to increase the number of directors to
12 so that, as of the effective time, the board of directors of the combined company will consist of (a) nine directors designated by Strayer,
(b) J. Kevin Gilligan, Chief Executive Officer of Capella, and (c) two additional designees who are currently members of the Capella
board of directors

and are recommended by Mr. Gilligan. In addition, one of the two additional Capella designees will be appointed to serve on the
Compensation Committee of the combined company.

Limitation on Director's Liability

        The charter of the combined company provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law, the liability of any director or
officer to the combined company or its stockholders for money damages shall be limited to the sum of $10.00, provided that nothing
contained in such provision of the charter shall limit the liability of a director or officer (i) to the extent that it is proved that the person
actually received an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services, for the amount of the benefit or profit in money, property or
services actually received, or (ii) to the extent that a judgment or other final adjudication adverse to the person is entered in a proceeding
based on a finding in the proceeding that the person's action, or failure to act, was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty and was
material to the cause of action adjudicated in the proceeding.

Business Combinations 

        Under Maryland law, "business combinations" between a Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an
interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested
stockholder. These business combinations include a merger, consolidation, share exchange, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, an
asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities. An interested stockholder is defined as:

• any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's outstanding
voting stock; or 

• an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the
beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the
corporation.

        A person is not an interested stockholder under the statute if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which he,
she or it otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. However, in approving a transaction, the board of directors may provide
that its approval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board of
directors.

        After the five-year prohibition, any business combination between the Maryland corporation and an interested stockholder generally
must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:

• 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation; and 

• two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the
interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate
or associate of the interested stockholder.

        These super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the corporation's common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined
under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested
stockholder for his, her or its shares.

        The statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations involving a corporation whose original
charter has a provision electing not to be subject to the statute. The charter of the combined company includes such an election.
Consequently, the five-year

Table of Contents

prohibition and the super-majority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations to which the combined company may be
party.

        There can be no assurance that the combined company's charter will not be amended in the future to eliminate that election, in which
case the business combination statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of the combined company and delay or prevent
a transaction or change in control which might involve a premium price for the combined company shares or otherwise be in the best
interest of the stockholders. However, any such amendment to the combined company's charter will require the affirmative vote of a
majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by stockholders on the matter.

Control Share Acquisitions 

        Maryland law provides that control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights
except to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on
the matter, excluding shares:

• owned by the acquiring person or an affiliate/associate of the acquiring person; 

• owned by our officers; and 

• owned by our employees who are also directors.

        "Control shares" mean voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquirer in respect of
which the acquirer can exercise or direct the exercise of voting power, would entitle the acquiring person to exercise voting power in
electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power:

• one-tenth or more, but less than one-third of all voting power; 

• one-third or more, but less than a majority of all voting power; or 

• a majority or more of all voting power.

        Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder
approval or shares acquired directly from the corporation. A control share acquisition occurs when, subject to some exceptions, a person
directly or indirectly acquires ownership or the power to direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy)
of issued and outstanding control shares. A person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition, upon satisfaction of
some specific conditions, including an undertaking to pay expenses, may compel the board of directors to call a meeting of the
stockholders to be held within fifty (50) days of a request to consider the voting rights of the control shares. If no request for a meeting is
made, we may present the question at any stockholders' meeting.

        If voting rights are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement on or before
the tenth (10th) day after the control share acquisition as required by the statute, then, subject to some conditions and limitations, we may
acquire any or all of the control shares (except those for which voting rights have been previously approved) for fair value determined,
without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquirer or if
a meeting of stockholders at which the voting rights of such shares are considered and not approved is held, as of the date of such meeting.
If voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares
entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of such
appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquirer in the control share acquisition. The control share
acquisition

Table of Contents

statute does not apply to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation, or share exchange if we are a party to the transaction or to acquisitions
approved or exempted by our charter or bylaws.

        As permitted by the MGCL, the charter of the combined company contains a provision exempting from the control share acquisition
statute any and all acquisitions of combined company shares by any person. There can be no assurance that the combined company's
charter will not be amended in the future to eliminate that provision, in which case the control share acquisition statute may discourage
others from trying to acquire control of the combined company and may delay or prevent a transaction or change in control which might
involve a premium price for the combined company shares or otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders. However, any such
amendment to the combined company's charter will require the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by
stockholders on the matter.

Additional Provisions of Maryland Law 

        Maryland law provides that a Maryland corporation that is subject to the Exchange Act and has at least three independent directors
can elect by resolution of the board of directors to be subject to some corporate governance provisions that may be inconsistent with the
corporation's charter and bylaws. Under the applicable statute, a board of directors may classify itself without the vote of stockholders.
A board of directors classified in that manner cannot be declassified by amendment to the charter of the corporation. Further, the board of
directors may, by electing into applicable statutory provisions and notwithstanding the charter or bylaws:

• provide that a special meeting of stockholders will be called only at the request of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of
the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting; 

• reserve for itself the right to fix the number of directors; 

• provide that a director may be removed only by the vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the stock entitled to vote; 

• retain for itself sole authority to fill vacancies created by the death, removal or resignation of a director; and 

• provide that all vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
remaining directors in office, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum.

        In addition, if the board of directors is classified, a director elected to fill a vacancy under this provision will serve for the balance of
the unexpired term instead of until the next annual meeting of stockholders. A board of directors may implement all or any of these
provisions without amending the charter or bylaws and without stockholder approval. A corporation may be prohibited by its charter or by
resolution of its board of directors from electing any of the provisions of the statute. The combined company is not prohibited from
implementing any or all of the possible statutory elections.

Amendment of the Organizational Documents 

        Except for those amendments permitted to be made without stockholder approval, such as changing the name of the combined
company, the combined company charter may be amended, after approval by the board of directors, by the affirmative vote of a majority
of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. The combined company bylaws may be amended in any manner not inconsistent with the
charter by a majority vote of the board of directors or by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding a majority of the combined company
shares entitled to vote on the matter.

COMPARISON OF STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS 

        The rights of Capella shareholders are governed by the Capella articles of incorporation and the Capella bylaws, as well as the
MBCA. The rights of Strayer stockholders are governed by the Strayer charter and the Strayer bylaws, as well as the MGCL. Upon
consummation of the merger, the rights of the stockholders of the combined company will be governed by the amended and restated
charter of the combined company, which is attached as Annex B to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the bylaws of the combined
company, which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement to which this joint proxy statement/prospectus relates, both of which are
incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, as well as the MGCL.

        The following is a summary discussion of the material differences, as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, between the
current rights of Capella shareholders and the current rights of the Strayer stockholders and the rights of stockholders in the combined
company following the merger. The rights described with respect to Strayer stockholders and combined company stockholders are the
same unless otherwise indicated. Please consult the MGCL and the respective articles of incorporation and bylaws of Strayer and the
combined company for a more complete understanding of these differences.

        The following description does not purport to be a complete statement of all the differences, or a complete description of the specific
provisions referred to in this summary. The identification of specific differences is not intended to indicate that other equally or more
significant differences do not exist. Stockholders should read carefully the relevant provisions of the MGCL, the Strayer charter and the
Strayer bylaws (including the proposed amendment and restatement of the Strayer charter), the MBCA, the Capella articles of
incorporation and the Capella bylaws and the charter and bylaws of the combined company. Capella and Strayer have filed with the SEC
their respective governing documents referenced in this summary of stockholder rights and will send copies to you without charge, upon
your request. See "Where You Can Find More Information."

Strayer/Combined Company

        Under the MGCL, stockholders of a Maryland corporation are granted appraisal rights in certain circumstances, including if: (i) the
corporation consolidates or merges with another corporation; (ii) a stockholder's stock is to be acquired in a share exchange, or (iii) the
corporation amends its charter in a way which alters the contract rights of any outstanding stock and substantially adversely affects the
stockholder's rights. The stockholders can seek appraisal of fair value for their shares as of a date to be determined by the MGCL,
depending on the type of transaction involved. A stockholder seeking appraisal rights must follow certain procedures specified in the
MGCL, including, filing a written objection to the proposed transaction with the corporation.

        Subject to the MGCL, stockholders are not permitted appraisal rights in a number of circumstances, including if any shares of the
class or series of the stock are listed on a national securities exchange, on the date notice is given of a merger or on the record date,
depending on the kind of transaction or the stock is not entitled to be voted on the transaction. As long as Strayer's shares are listed on the
NASDAQ, Strayer stockholders will not have appraisal rights if they object to such a transaction.

Number and Election of Directors 

Capella

        The Capella bylaws provide for a board of directors consisting of a number of directors determined by the board of directors, but in
no event may the number of directors be fewer than one (1). Capella currently has nine (9) directors. In accordance with the MBCA and
the Capella articles of incorporation, Capella directors are elected by a majority of the voting power of the shares present and entitled to
vote on the election of directors, provided a quorum is present. In addition, under the current articles of incorporation of Capella,
shareholders do not have any cumulative voting rights.

Strayer/Combined Company

        The Strayer bylaws provide for a board of directors consisting of up to twelve (12) directors or any other number as shall be
determined by a majority of the board of directors. Strayer currently has ten directors. Under the MGCL, because the Strayer charter does
not provide for cumulative voting, no stockholder has the right to cumulate votes. In addition, in accordance with the Strayer bylaws, each
director shall be elected by a majority of votes cast with respect to such director at any meeting for the election of directors at which a
quorum is present. If, as of a date that is fourteen (14) days in advance of the date Strayer files its definitive proxy statement with the SEC
(regardless of whether or not the proxy statement is thereafter revised or supplemented), the number of director nominees exceeds the
number of directors to be elected, then each director shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in person or by proxy at such meeting.

Term of Directors 

Capella

        In accordance with the Capella bylaws, the Capella board of directors shall serve for an indefinite term that expires at the next regular
meeting of the shareholders. A director of Capella shall hold office until a successor is elected and has qualified or until the earlier death,

Removal or Resignation of Directors

power of all Capella shares entitled to vote at an election of directors. Under the MBCA, Capella directors may also be removed with or
without cause at any time: (i) if the director was named by the board of directors to fill a vacancy, (ii) if the Capella shareholders have not

the remaining directors present affirmatively vote to remove the director.

Strayer/Combined Company

        Strayer directors may be removed at any time by Strayer stockholders, with or without cause, by the affirmative vote of a majority of

electronic transmission may provide that such resignation will be effective at a later time or on the occurrence of an event, that such
resignation is irrevocable on the occurrence of the event, and that if the resignation will be effective on the failure of the director to receive
a specified vote for reelection, the resignation is irrevocable.

Vacancies on the Board of Directors 

Capella

addition, vacancies on the board of directors resulting from newly created directorships may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority
of the directors serving at the time such directorships are created.

Table of Contents

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT OF CAPELLA 

        The following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of Capella common stock as of December 6, 2017
by:

• each person or entity, including any "group" as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, who is known to
own beneficially more than 5% of the outstanding shares of Capella common stock; 

• each current director of Capella; 

• each of the Named Executive Officers of Capella; and 

• all directors and executive officers of Capella as a group.

        Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the SEC's rules. The SEC has defined "beneficial" ownership of a security to
mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of voting power and/or investment power. In computing percentage ownership of each person,
shares of common stock subject to options, warrants or rights held by that person that are currently exercisable, or exercisable within
60 days of December 6, 2017, are deemed to be outstanding and beneficially owned by that person. These shares, however, are not deemed
outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

        To Capella's knowledge and except as indicated in the notes to this table and pursuant to applicable community property laws, each
shareholder named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares set forth opposite such shareholder's name.
Percentage of ownership is based on 11,623,793 shares of Capella common stock outstanding on December 6, 2017. All fractional
common share amounts have been rounded to the nearest whole number. The address

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

        THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is dated as of October 29, 2017, by and among Capella
Education Company, a Minnesota corporation ("Cardinal"), Strayer Education, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Sarg"), and Sarg Sub Inc., a
Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Sarg ("Merger Sub").

RECITALS 

        WHEREAS, each of Cardinal, Sarg and Merger Sub desire, following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article 6, to effect the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement pursuant to which Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into Cardinal, with Cardinal as the surviving entity in the Merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Sarg;

        WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of each of Cardinal, Sarg and Merger Sub have approved and declared advisable this
Agreement, the plan of merger (as such term is used in Section 302A.611 of the MBCA) contained in this Agreement (the "Plan of
Merger") and the Transactions, including the Merger, and determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of their respective
companies and shareholders to consummate the Merger and the Transactions on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and
the Plan of Merger;

        WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Sarg has, subject to Section 5.4, resolved to recommend the approval of the Sarg Share
Issuance and the amendment and restatement of the Sarg Charter as set forth in the Amended Sarg Charter to the Sarg stockholders, and,
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Sarg shall approve this Agreement and the Merger as the sole shareholder of
Merger Sub;

        WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Cardinal has, subject to Section 5.4, resolved to recommend the approval of the Merger, this
Agreement and the adoption of the Plan of Merger by the Cardinal shareholders;

        WHEREAS, Cardinal, Sarg and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and

        WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, the parties hereto intend that the Merger qualifies as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Treasury Regulations"), and that this
Agreement shall be, and hereby is, adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code.

AGREEMENT 

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises contained in this Agreement and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1
THE MERGER 

        1.1    The Merger.     

        (a)   At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Cardinal (the "Merger") in accordance with the MBCA,
and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and
Cardinal shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). As a result of the Merger, the Surviving
Corporation shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of Sarg. The Merger and other transactions

contemplated by this Agreement are referred to herein as the "Transactions." References herein to "Cardinal" with respect to the
period from and after the Effective Time shall be deemed to be references to the Surviving Corporation.

        (b)   The Merger shall have the effects specified in the applicable provisions of the MBCA. From and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations,
liabilities and duties of Cardinal and Merger Sub, all as provided under the MBCA.

        1.2    Closing.     The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Latham & Watkins LLP, 885 Third
Avenue, New York, New York 10022-4834, at 9:00 a.m. local time, as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within three (3) Business
Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all applicable conditions set forth in Article 6 (except for any
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions or waiver by the party
entitled to waive such conditions) or at such other time and place as Cardinal and Sarg shall agree; provided that if such date would make
it reasonably unlikely for the parties to either (a) comply with any Educational Laws applicable on a post-Closing basis in order to obtain
any Educational Consent or (b) satisfy conditions under applicable DOE regulations for continuing the effectiveness of any TPPPA, the
Closing will take place on the first (1st) Business Day of the immediately following month, without regard to the Outside Date (unless
Cardinal and Merger Sub mutually agree to an earlier date in writing). The date and time at which the Closing occurs is referred to herein
as the "Closing Date."

        1.3    Effective Time.     

        (a)   On the Closing Date, Cardinal and Merger Sub shall file articles of merger relating to the Merger (the "Articles of
Merger") with the Secretary of State of Minnesota, executed and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
MBCA.

        (b)   The Merger shall become effective at the time the Articles of Merger shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Minnesota, or such later time as Sarg and Cardinal shall agree and specify in the Articles of Merger (such time
as the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

        1.4    Charters and Bylaws.     

        (a)    Surviving Corporation Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.    At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated pursuant to the Merger in their entirety as set forth on Exhibit A, until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The name of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be "Capella Education Company". At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in their entirety so as to be identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except that the name of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be "Capella
Education Company") until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

        (b)    Sarg Charter and Bylaws; Name.    Subject to the receipt of the Sarg Stockholder Approval, at the Effective Time, the
Sarg Charter (as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall be amended and restated in its entirety as set forth on
Exhibit B (the "Amended Sarg Charter"), until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The Sarg
Board will take such action as is necessary in order that, as set forth in the Amended Sarg Charter, the name of Sarg from and after
the Effective Time shall be "Strategic Education, Inc.".

        1.5    Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.     From and after the Effective Time, until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with applicable Law, (i) the directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
designated by Sarg and (ii) the officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be designated by Sarg.

        1.6    Directors and Officers of Sarg.     Effective at the Effective Time, unless otherwise agreed by Sarg and Cardinal in writing, the
Sarg Board shall take all necessary action to cause the size of the Sarg Board to be increased to twelve (12) directors in order to appoint, as
of the Effective Time, nine (9) directors to be designated, prior to the consummation of the Merger, by Sarg and three (3) directors to be
designated, prior to the consummation of the Merger, by Cardinal pursuant to the procedure set forth in the following sentence (such
designees of Cardinal, the "Additional Board Designees"). The Additional Board Designees shall consist of (i) the chief executive officer
of Cardinal as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) two (2) additional designees (or, if clause (i) is not applicable, three (3) designees)
who are currently members of the Cardinal Board recommended by the chief executive officer of Cardinal or the Cardinal Board (if
clause (i) is not applicable) to the Sarg Board and the nominating and corporate governance committee of the Sarg Board for approval,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Prior to the 2019 annual meeting of Sarg stockholders, Sarg and the Sarg Board shall not
take any actions to increase the size of the Sarg Board to more than twelve (12) directors without the consent of a majority of the
Additional Board Designees. Effective at the Effective Time, unless otherwise agreed by Sarg and Cardinal in writing, Sarg shall take all
necessary action to cause (i) Robert S. Silberman to continue as executive chairman of the Sarg Board, (ii) J. Kevin Gilligan to be
appointed to act as the vice chairman of the Sarg Board, (iii) Karl McDonnell to continue as the President and Chief Executive Officer of
Sarg, (iv) Steven L. Polacek to be appointed as the Chief Integration/Transition Officer of Sarg and (v) one Additional Board Designee to
be appointed to the compensation committee of the Sarg Board. The Sarg Board shall nominate the Additional Board Designees for
election at (i) if the Effective Time is prior to the 2018 annual meeting of Sarg stockholders, then the 2018 annual meeting of Sarg
stockholders or (ii) if the Effective Time is after the 2018 annual meeting of Sarg stockholders, then the 2019 annual meeting of Sarg
stockholders. In the event that any of the Additional Board Designees becomes unable to serve as a member of the Sarg Board and resigns
therefrom due to such person's death or disability prior to the 2019 annual meeting of Sarg stockholders, then a replacement to fill the
resulting vacancy on the Sarg Board shall be recommended by the remaining Additional Board Designees to the Sarg Board and the
nominating and corporate governance committee of the Sarg Board for approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.

ARTICLE 2
CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER 

        2.1    Effect on Capital Stock of Cardinal and Merger Sub.     At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Cardinal, Sarg, Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of Cardinal common stock, $0.01 par value per share ("Cardinal
Common Stock"):

        (a)   All shares of Cardinal Common Stock that are owned by Cardinal, Sarg, Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary of
Cardinal, Sarg or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

        (b)   Subject to Section 2.1(a), Section 2.3, Section 2.4 and Section 2.6, each share of Cardinal Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and thereafter represent the right to receive that
number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Sarg common stock, $0.01 par value per share ("Sarg Common
Stock"), equal to the Exchange Ratio and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Sarg Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.4.
The shares of Sarg Common Stock to be issued upon the conversion

Table of Contents

of shares of Cardinal Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.1, and the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Sarg Common
Stock as contemplated by Section 2.4, are referred to collectively as the "Merger Consideration." For purposes of this Agreement,
"Exchange Ratio" means 0.875.

        (c)   All of the outstanding shares of Cardinal Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1 and shall cease to be outstanding and shall cease to exist and, as of the Effective Time,
each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Cardinal Common Stock (a "Cardinal Certificate") or shares of
Cardinal Common Stock held in book entry form ("Cardinal Book-Entry Shares") shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive, in accordance with Section 2.1(b), the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this Agreement, upon surrender of such Cardinal Certificate or Cardinal Book-Entry Share in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

        (d)   Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Surviving Corporation.

        2.2    Effect on Sarg Common Stock.     At the Effective Time, each share of Sarg Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding. Immediately following the Effective Time, shares of Sarg Common Stock owned by
Surviving Corporation or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Surviving Corporation shall be surrendered to Sarg and cancelled without
payment therefor.

        2.3    Certain Adjustments.     Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Cardinal Common Stock or Sarg Common Stock shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution thereon shall be
declared with a record date within said period, the Merger Consideration and the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items,
as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of Cardinal Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

        2.4    Fractional Shares.     No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Sarg Common Stock shall be issued upon the
conversion of Cardinal Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, no dividend or distribution with respect to Sarg Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any such fractional share and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of
a shareholder of Sarg. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Cardinal Common Stock that are
converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Sarg Common Stock (after
taking into account all shares of Cardinal Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest)
in an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the VWAP of Sarg Common Stock. The parties acknowledge that payment of
cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Sarg of issuing fractional
shares and does not represent separately bargained-for consideration.

        2.5    Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares     

        (a)   Prior to the dissemination of the Joint Proxy Statement to the shareholders of Cardinal and the stockholders of Sarg, Sarg
shall appoint its transfer agent to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment and delivery of the Merger
Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, Sarg shall deposit or shall cause to be deposited, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Cardinal Common Stock, with the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this

Article 2, (i) a number of shares of Sarg Common Stock equal to the total number of shares of Sarg Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 2.1 and (ii) cash sufficient to make payments (x) of any dividends or other distributions declared or made prior
to the Effective Time with a record date after the Effective Time to such holders and (y) in lieu of any fractional shares of Sarg
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.4 (collectively, the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the shares of Sarg Common Stock contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.1 out of the Exchange
Fund. Except as contemplated by Section 2.4 hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

        (b)    Exchange Procedures.    As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) Business
Days thereafter), Sarg shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Cardinal Certificate or Cardinal Book-
Entry Share, in each case which shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time
pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Cardinal Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Cardinal Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall otherwise be
in such form and have such other provisions as Cardinal, Sarg and the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify, and
(ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Cardinal Certificates or Cardinal Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, as applicable. With respect to holders of Cardinal Book-Entry Shares, the parties shall cooperate to establish
procedures with the Exchange Agent to allow the Exchange Agent to transmit, following the Effective Time, to such holders or
their nominees, upon surrender of Cardinal Common Stock, the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions, in each
case, to which such holders are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Upon surrender of Cardinal Certificates and
Cardinal Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Sarg
and Cardinal, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form with all required enclosures and
attachments, with respect to such Cardinal Certificates or Cardinal Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Cardinal Certificates or
Cardinal Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Cardinal Common Stock
formerly represented by such Cardinal Certificates and for each Cardinal Book-Entry Share. Any Cardinal Certificates and
Cardinal Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Cardinal Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent to
payment that the Cardinal Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer,
and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the delivery of
the Merger Consideration, as applicable, to a Person other than the registered holder of the Cardinal Certificate so surrendered and
shall have established to the satisfaction of Sarg that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid. Delivery of
the Merger Consideration, as applicable, with respect to Cardinal Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Cardinal Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Cardinal Certificate or
Cardinal Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Agreement.

        (c)    Transfer Books.    At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Cardinal shall be closed and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers of shares of Cardinal Common Stock on the records of Cardinal. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Cardinal Certificates and Cardinal Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Cardinal Common Stock

to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in
this Agreement.

        (d)    Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property.    At any time following twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, Sarg
shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any shares of Sarg Common Stock or cash remaining in the
Exchange Fund made available to the Exchange Agent and not delivered to holders of Cardinal Certificates or Cardinal Book-
Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Sarg (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Cardinal Certificates or Cardinal Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in Section 2.5. If, prior to six years after
the Closing Date (or otherwise immediately prior to such time on which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), any holder of
Cardinal Certificates or Cardinal Book-Entry Shares has not complied with the procedures in Section 2.5 to receive the Merger
Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise
be entitled in respect of such Cardinal Certificates or Cardinal Book-Entry Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Sarg, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Sarg nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Cardinal Certificate or Cardinal Book-Entry
Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

        (e)    Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.    In the event that any Cardinal Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Cardinal Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1(b)
hereof; provided, however, that Sarg or the Exchange Agent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the
payment of the Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Cardinal Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Sarg, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent with respect to the Cardinal Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

        (f)    Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Cardinal Common Stock.    No dividends or other distributions declared or
made after the Effective Time with respect to Sarg Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Cardinal Certificate or Cardinal Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of Sarg Common Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.4,
unless and until the holder of such Cardinal Certificate or Cardinal Book-Entry Share shall surrender such Cardinal Certificate or
Cardinal Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Agreement. Subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Cardinal Certificate, there shall be paid by Sarg to the holder of the certificates representing whole
shares of Sarg Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any cash payable with
respect to a fractional share of Sarg Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.4 and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Sarg Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole
shares of Sarg Common Stock.

        2.6    Cardinal Stock Options and Stock-Based Awards     .

        (a)    Treatment of Cardinal Stock Options.    

          (i)  As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
option to purchase shares of Cardinal Common Stock (a "Cardinal Stock Option") granted under (i) the Cardinal 2005
Stock Incentive Plan (the "Cardinal 2005 Stock Plan") or (ii) the Cardinal 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Cardinal 2014
Equity Plan" and together with the Cardinal 2005 Stock Plan, the "Cardinal Stock Plans") to a Cardinal non-employee
director who will not be a member of the Board of Directors of Sarg immediately following the Effective Time (a
"Cardinal Director Stock Option") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration that would have been payable in respect of each
Net Company Share in respect of such Cardinal Director Stock Options had such Net Company Share been outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that (A) any holder who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Sarg Common Stock in respect of a Cardinal Director Stock Option shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Sarg Common Stock multiplied by
the VWAP of Sarg Common Stock and (B) any Cardinal Director Stock Option that has an exercise price that is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration Value shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration. Any delivery of
shares of Sarg Common Stock or cash in lieu thereof pursuant to this Section 2.6(a)(i) shall be subject to the same
procedures, requirements and conditions as applicable to the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.

         (ii)  As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
Cardinal Stock Option granted under the Cardinal Stock Plans to a former Cardinal employee, director or consultant (a
"Cardinal Non-Employee Stock Option") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the
number of Net Company Shares in respect of the applicable Cardinal Non-Employee Stock Option had such Net Company
Shares been outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) the VWAP of Sarg Common Stock; provided,
however, that any Cardinal Non-Employee Stock Option that has an exercise price that is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration Value shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration. Any delivery of cash pursuant to
this Section 2.6(a)(i) shall be subject to the same procedures, requirements and conditions as applicable to the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Agreement.

        (iii)  As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
Cardinal Stock Option other than a Cardinal Director Stock Option and a Cardinal Non-Employee Stock Option (each, a
"Cardinal Employee Stock Option") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
or not then vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by Sarg and shall be converted into an option (a "Sarg Stock Option") to
acquire shares of Sarg Common Stock in accordance with this Section 2.6(a)(iii). Each such Sarg Stock Option as so
assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the
Cardinal Employee Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto by
reason of this Agreement or the Transactions). As of the Effective Time, each such Sarg Stock Option as so assumed and
converted shall be an option to acquire that number of whole shares of Sarg Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Cardinal Common Stock subject to such Cardinal
Employee Stock Option and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise

price per share of Sarg Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
(x) the exercise price per share of Cardinal Common Stock of such Cardinal Employee Stock Option by (y) the Exchange
Ratio; provided, that the exercise price and the number of shares of Sarg Common Stock subject to the Sarg Stock Option
shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case of Cardinal
Employee Stock Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Code, consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code.

        (b)    Treatment of Cardinal Restricted Stock Units.    

          (i)  As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each
restricted stock unit (including "market stock unit" and "performance stock unit") award granted under the applicable
Cardinal Stock Plan covering Cardinal Common Stock, including any such awards subject to vesting based on the
achievement of any performance goals or market-based conditions, (each, a "Cardinal RSU") to a Cardinal non-employee
director (a "Cardinal Director RSU") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become vested in
full.

         (ii)  Subject to Section 2.6(b)(iii) below, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each Cardinal RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
assumed by Sarg and shall be converted into a restricted stock unit award (a "Sarg RSU") to acquire Sarg Common Stock in
accordance with this Section 2.6. Each such Sarg RSU as so assumed and converted shall continue to have, and shall be
subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to the Cardinal RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (but
taking into account any changes thereto by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions), including, without limitation, to
the extent applicable, the requirement to deliver shares of Sarg Common Stock in respect thereof to the extent that the
holder of such Sarg RSU made a valid deferral election to defer settlement of such Sarg RSU upon the occurrence of a
"change in control event" or a "separation from service", as applicable. As of the Effective Time, each such Sarg RSU as so
assumed and converted shall be a restricted stock unit award for that number of shares of Sarg Common Stock (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Cardinal Common Stock underlying
such Cardinal RSU multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio.

        (c)   Prior to the Effective Time, Cardinal shall take all necessary action for the adjustment of Cardinal Employee Stock
Options and Cardinal RSUs under this Section 2.6.

        (d)   At the Effective Time, Sarg shall assume all the obligations of Cardinal under the Cardinal Stock Plans, each Sarg Stock
Option and Sarg RSU that is assumed and converted in accordance with this Section 2.6, and the agreements evidencing the grants
thereof, and the number and kind of shares available for issuance under each Cardinal Stock Plan shall be adjusted to reflect shares
of Sarg Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Cardinal Stock Plan. Sarg shall reserve for future
issuance a number of shares of Sarg Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Sarg Common Stock that will be
subject to Sarg Stock Options and Sarg RSUs as a result of the actions contemplated by this Section 2.6. Not later than the Closing
Date, Sarg shall file an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) with respect to the Sarg Common
Stock subject to such Sarg Stock Options and Sarg RSUs and shall, as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, distribute a
prospectus relating to such Form S-8, and Sarg shall use reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such Sarg Stock Options and Sarg RSUs remain outstanding.

        (e)   As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Cardinal shall take all actions with respect to the Cardinal
ESPP that are necessary to provide that, subject to the consummation of the Merger, the Cardinal ESPP shall terminate, effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        2.7    Withholding.    

        The parties shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, including any payments made pursuant to Section 2.6 hereof, any amounts as are required
to be withheld or deducted with respect to such consideration under the Code, or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. The parties or the Exchange Agent, as appropriate, shall provide commercially reasonable notice to Cardinal upon becoming aware
of any such withholding obligation and shall cooperate with Cardinal to the extent reasonable to obtain reduction of or relief from such
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Cardinal Common Stock, Cardinal Stock
Option and/or Cardinal RSU in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

ARTICLE 3
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SARG AND MERGER SUB 

        Except (a) as set forth in the Sarg Disclosure Schedule and (b) as otherwise disclosed or identified in the Sarg SEC Documents
publicly filed or furnished after January 1, 2017 and prior to the date hereof (other than (i) any forward-looking disclosures contained in
the "Forward Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" sections of the Sarg SEC Documents and any other disclosures included therein to
the extent they are primarily predictive, cautionary or forward looking in nature and (ii) information included in, or incorporated by

        3.1    Corporate Organization.     Sarg is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Maryland and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate all of its properties and assets and to carry

Material Adverse Effect. Each of Sarg and its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by
it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Sarg Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the charter of Sarg (the
"Sarg Charter"), and Amended and Restated Bylaws of Sarg (the "Sarg Bylaws"), as most recently filed with the Sarg SEC Documents,
and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub previously provided to Cardinal, are true, complete and correct copies of such
documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Sarg is not in material violation of any of the provisions of the Sarg Charter or
Sarg Bylaws.

free of preemptive rights and is owned, beneficially and of record, by Sarg or one or more of its wholly owned Subsidiaries free
and clear of all Liens. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of Sarg or any of its Subsidiaries to provide funds to, or
make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary of Sarg or any other Person, other

Approval, to consummate the Transactions applicable to such party. The execution and delivery by each of Sarg and Merger Sub of
this Agreement, the performance and compliance by Sarg and Merger Sub with each of its obligations herein and the
consummation by Sarg and Merger Sub of the Transactions applicable to it have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of Sarg and Merger Sub, subject to receipt of the Sarg Stockholder Approval and to the adoption of this
Agreement by Sarg as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Sarg or Merger Sub
and no shareholder votes are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the consummation by Sarg and Merger Sub of the
Transactions to which it is a party. Each of Sarg and Merger Sub has duly and validly executed and delivered this Agreement and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Cardinal of this Agreement, this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid
and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally, by general equitable principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Entity before which any
Proceeding seeking enforcement may be brought.

restatement of the Sarg Charter as set forth in the Amended Sarg Charter be submitted to the stockholders of Sarg for approval, and

takeover, business combination, control share acquisition or similar Law (collectively, "Takeover Laws") applies to the Merger or
the other Transactions. The only vote of holders of any class or series of Sarg Common Stock or other Equity Interests of Sarg
necessary to consummate the Transactions is (i) the approval of the Sarg Share Issuance by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast thereon at the Sarg Stockholders Meeting, and (ii) the approval of the amendment and restatement of the Sarg Charter as
set forth in the Amended Sarg Charter by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast thereon by the holders of
Sarg Common Stock at the Sarg Stockholders Meeting (the "Sarg

nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any charge, complaint, claim, demand, or notice in writing since January 1, 2013 (or
earlier, if presently not resolved) alleging any such infringement, misappropriation, dilution, or violation (including any claim that
Sarg or any of its Subsidiaries must license or refrain from using any Intellectual Property rights of any Person), in each case that

Property that is material to their business ("Sarg Material Intellectual Property"). All Sarg Material Intellectual Property that
derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who can
obtain economic value from its disclosure or use has been maintained in confidence in accordance with protection procedures that
are adequate for protection, and in accordance with procedures customarily used in the industry to protect rights of like
importance. To the Knowledge of Sarg, there has been no unauthorized use or disclosure of any confidential Sarg Material
Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of Sarg, all former and current officers, directors, employees, consultants, advisors, and
independent contractors of Sarg and its Subsidiaries, and each of their predecessors, who have contributed to or participated in the
conception and development of Sarg Material Intellectual Property for such entities have entered into valid and binding proprietary
rights agreements with Sarg or one of its Subsidiaries or predecessors, vesting ownership of such Sarg Material Intellectual
Property in Sarg or one of its Subsidiaries, without any restrictions or obligations on Sarg or its Subsidiaries' use, ownership,
disposition or other exploitation of such Sarg Material Intellectual Property. No such Person has asserted, and to the Knowledge of
Sarg, no such Person has, any right, title, interest or other claim in, or the right to receive any royalties or other consideration with
respect to, any such Sarg Material Intellectual Property.

implemented commercially reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality and security of such IT Assets and information
stored or contained therein against any unauthorized use, access, interruption or corruption. Sarg and its Subsidiaries have
implemented commercially reasonable data backup, data storage, system redundancy and disaster avoidance procedures with
respect to their IT Assets. To the Knowledge of Sarg, there have not been any incidents of security breaches to, or other material
unauthorized access to or use of, (i) any of its IT Assets (including with respect to any data or other information stored or
contained therein or accessed, transmitted or processed thereby), or (ii) any data, trade secrets or other confidential information of
Sarg or any of its Subsidiaries, including any business information and/or personally-identifying information or data of any Person.

        Except (a) as set forth in the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule and (b) as otherwise disclosed or identified in the Cardinal SEC
Documents publicly filed or furnished after January 1, 2017 and prior to the date hereof (other than (i) any forward-looking disclosures
contained in the "Forward Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" sections of the Cardinal SEC Documents and any other disclosures
included therein to the extent they are primarily predictive, cautionary or forward looking in nature and (ii) information included in, or
incorporated by reference as, exhibits and schedules to any Cardinal SEC Document), Cardinal hereby represents and warrants to Sarg as

the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Cardinal Material Adverse Effect. The copies of the articles of incorporation (the "Cardinal Charter")
and bylaws (the "Cardinal Bylaws") of Cardinal, as most recently filed with the Cardinal SEC Documents are true, complete and correct
copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement. Cardinal is not in material violation of any of the provisions of the
Cardinal Charter or the Cardinal Bylaws.

        4.2    Cardinal Capitalization.     

        (a)   The authorized capital stock of Cardinal consists of two hundred million (200,000,000) shares of Cardinal Common
Stock and two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share ("Cardinal Preferred Stock").

October 26, 2017 (x) Cardinal does not have any capital stock or other Equity Interests authorized, issued or outstanding and
(y) except for Cardinal Stock Options and Cardinal RSUs to purchase not more than 733,619 shares of Cardinal Common Stock,
there are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character to which Cardinal or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries is bound relating to the issued or unissued capital stock
or other Equity Interests of Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
such capital stock or other Equity Interests, or obligating Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, sell, repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock or other Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or

shares of its capital stock or other Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such capital
stock or other Equity Interests, other than those shares of capital stock reserved for issuance described in the second sentence of
this Section 4.2(a) or as expressly permitted pursuant to Section 5.2(b). Cardinal has previously provided Sarg with a true and
complete list, as of the date hereof, of the prices at which each outstanding Cardinal Stock Option and Cardinal RSU may be
exercised under the applicable Cardinal Stock Plan, the number of Cardinal Stock Options and Cardinal RSUs outstanding at each
such price, the number of shares underlying each award of Cardinal Stock Options and Cardinal RSUs, and the vesting schedule of
the Cardinal Stock Options and Cardinal RSUs (including performance-vesting goals). None of the Cardinal Stock Options are
"incentive stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. All shares of Cardinal Common Stock subject to issuance
under the applicable Cardinal Stock Plan, upon issuance prior to the Effective Time on the terms and conditions specified in the
instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Cardinal having the right to vote on any matters

        (c)   Section 4.2(c) of the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all of the Subsidiaries of Cardinal
and the authorized, issued and outstanding Equity Interests and the jurisdiction of organization of each such Subsidiary. Except as
set forth in Section 4.2(c) of the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule, none of Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries holds an Equity Interest
in any other Person. Each outstanding share of capital stock of or other Equity Interest in each Subsidiary of Cardinal is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and is owned, beneficially and of record, by
Cardinal or one or more of its wholly owned Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens. There are no outstanding contractual
obligations of Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries to provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary of Cardinal or any other Person, other than guarantees by Cardinal of any
indebtedness or other obligations of any wholly owned Subsidiary of Cardinal.

        4.3    Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability.     

        (a)   Cardinal has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform and comply with each

Transactions applicable to Cardinal. The execution and delivery by Cardinal of this Agreement, the performance and compliance
by Cardinal with each of its obligations herein and the consummation by it of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Cardinal, subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of the Cardinal Shareholder
Approval, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Cardinal and no other shareholder votes are necessary to authorize this

delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Sarg and Merger Sub of this Agreement,
this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as

other Equity Interests of Cardinal necessary to adopt this Agreement is the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority
of the shares of Cardinal Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon at the Cardinal Shareholders Meeting (the
"Cardinal Shareholder Approval"). No other vote of the holders of Cardinal Common Stock or any other Equity Interests of
Cardinal is necessary to consummate the Transactions.

        4.4    No Conflicts.     

        (a)   The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Cardinal does not and will not, and the performance of this Agreement
by Cardinal and the consummation of the Transactions will not, (i) assuming the Cardinal Shareholder Approval is obtained,

of any Subsidiary of Cardinal, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and permits described in Section 4.4(b)
have been obtained and all filings and notifications described in Section 4.4(b) have been made and any waiting periods thereunder

pursuant to, any Contract or Permit, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Cardinal
Material Adverse Effect.

        (b)   The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Cardinal does not and will not, and the consummation by Cardinal of
the Transactions to which it is a party and compliance by Cardinal with any of the terms or provisions hereof or thereof will not,

Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Cardinal's disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Cardinal in the reports that it

rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to Cardinal's management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302

involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Cardinal's internal control over financial reporting. Since

received any written (or to the Knowledge of Cardinal, oral) complaint, allegation, assertion or claim regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Cardinal or its Subsidiaries, or their respective internal accounting
controls or any other matter set forth in the immediately preceding sentence.

reflected in Cardinal's financial statements in accordance with GAAP), except (i) as disclosed, reflected or reserved against in the

would not reasonably be expected to have, a Cardinal Material Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in all material respects only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past

        (b)   Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Cardinal
Material Adverse Effect, each of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries owns and possesses all right, title and interest in and to (or has the
right pursuant to a valid and enforceable license) all Intellectual Property that is necessary for or used or held for use in the conduct
of the business of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries in substantially the same manner as presently conducted and currently proposed to
be conducted. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Cardinal, nor the performance of this Agreement by
Cardinal, will result in the loss, forfeiture, termination, or impairment of, or give rise to a right of any Person to limit, terminate, or
consent to the continued use of, any rights of Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries in any Cardinal Material Intellectual Property. No
Cardinal Material Intellectual Property owned by Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding consent,
settlement, or Order prohibiting or restricting Cardinal's or any of its Subsidiaries' use, ownership, disposition or other exploitation
thereof.

        (c)   Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Cardinal Material
Adverse Effect, neither Cardinal nor any of its Subsidiaries nor the conduct of their businesses is, or was during the past three

Cardinal nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any charge, complaint, claim, demand, or notice in writing since January 1, 2013
(or earlier, if presently not resolved) alleging any such infringement, misappropriation, dilution, or violation (including any claim
that Cardinal or any of its Subsidiaries must license or refrain from using any Intellectual Property rights of any Person), in each
case that would be material and adverse to Cardinal and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of Cardinal, no
Person is infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property owned by Cardinal or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither Cardinal nor any of its Subsidiaries has made or asserted any charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice
since January 1, 2013 (or earlier, if presently not resolved) alleging any such infringement, misappropriation, dilution, or violation
with respect to any Cardinal Material Intellectual Property.

        (d)   Cardinal and its Subsidiaries have taken commercially reasonable steps to maintain, police and protect the Intellectual
Property that is material to their business ("Cardinal Material Intellectual Property"). All Cardinal Material Intellectual Property
that derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to the public or to other persons who
can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use has been maintained in confidence in accordance with protection procedures
that are adequate for protection, and in accordance with procedures customarily used in the industry to protect rights of like
importance. To the Knowledge of Cardinal, there has been no unauthorized use or disclosure of any confidential Cardinal Material
Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of Cardinal, all former and current officers, directors, employees, consultants, advisors,
and independent contractors of Cardinal and its Subsidiaries, and each of their predecessors, who have contributed to or
participated in the conception and development of Cardinal Material Intellectual Property for such entities have entered into valid
and binding proprietary rights agreements with Cardinal or one of its Subsidiaries or predecessors, vesting ownership of such
Intellectual Property in Cardinal or one of its Subsidiaries, without any restrictions or obligations on Cardinal or its Subsidiaries'
use, ownership, disposition or other exploitation of such Cardinal Material Intellectual Property. No such Person has asserted, and
to the Knowledge of Cardinal, no such Person has, any right, title, interest or other claim in, or the right to receive any royalties or
other consideration with respect to, any such Cardinal Material Intellectual Property.

procedures with respect to their IT Assets. To the Knowledge of Cardinal, there have not been any incidents of security breaches
to, or other material unauthorized access to or use of, (i) any of its IT Assets (including with respect to any data or other

marketing, licensing, and distributing such applications; or (iii) allows a customer or requires that a customer have the right to
decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the software by its terms and not by operation of law. With respect to each
item of software included in the Cardinal Material Intellectual Property, either Cardinal or one of its Subsidiaries is (or will be at
Closing) in actual possession and control of the applicable source code, object code, code writes, notes, documentation,
programmers' source code annotations, user manuals and know-how to the extent required for use, distribution, development,
enhancement, maintenance and support of such software, subject to any licenses granted to third parties therein.

sale in any jurisdiction. In addition, each party agrees to provide the other party and their respective counsel with copies of any
written comments, and shall inform the other party of any oral comments, that such party or its counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of such comments,

established; (C) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure
which the Cardinal Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel is necessary under

Competing Proposal or (2) fail to reaffirm the Cardinal Recommendation, in either case within ten (10) Business Days after
such Competing Proposal is made public or after any reasonable, written request by Sarg to do so (the actions specified in
the foregoing clauses (x), (y) and (z) being referred to as a "Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change").

        (iii)  Notwithstanding any Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, this Agreement and the

        (a)   Each of Sarg and Cardinal shall immediately cease, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to
immediately cease, any discussions or negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to a Competing Proposal, or
that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal, and shall request to have promptly returned or destroyed, as
applicable, any information that has been provided to any Person in connection with any such discussions or negotiations that
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal. From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
date, if any, of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 7, each of Sarg and Cardinal shall not, and shall cause
its respective Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or induce
(including by way of furnishing information which has not been previously publicly disseminated), or take any other action that
could reasonably be expected to facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Competing Proposal, or (ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal;
provided, however, that if, prior to obtaining the Sarg Stockholder Approval (in the case of Sarg) or the Cardinal Shareholder
Approval (in the case of Cardinal) and following the receipt of a bona fide written unsolicited Competing Proposal made after the
date hereof and the Sarg Board or the Cardinal Board, as applicable, determines in good faith (after receiving advice of its financial
advisor and of its outside legal counsel) is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that was not, directly
or indirectly, solicited, initiated or knowingly encouraged in violation of this Section 5.4, the Sarg Board or the Cardinal Board, as
applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that a failure to take action with respect to such
Competing Proposal, as applicable, would be inconsistent with the directors' duties to Sarg under applicable Law (in the case of the
Sarg Board) or the directors' fiduciary duties to Cardinal's shareholders under applicable Law (in the case of the Cardinal Board),
then Sarg or Cardinal may, in response to such Competing Proposal, as applicable, and subject to compliance with Section 5.4(c),
(A) furnish information with respect to Sarg or Cardinal, as applicable, to the Person making such Competing Proposal pursuant to
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person regarding such
Competing Proposal. Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.4, each of Cardinal and Sarg shall not, and shall cause their

endorse, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to
any Competing Proposal or any proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing Proposal (an
"Alternative Acquisition Agreement"); (2) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Statute inapplicable to any
transactions contemplated by a Competing Proposal; or (3) terminate, amend, release, modify or knowingly fail to enforce any
provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or request under, any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by
the applicable party in respect of or in contemplation of a Competing Proposal (other than to the extent the Cardinal Board or the
Sarg Board, as applicable, determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take any of such
actions under clause (3) would be inconsistent with the directors' duties under applicable Law), or (4) propose to do any of the
foregoing. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 5.4(a) shall relieve any party from its obligations under Section 5.6.

        (b)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, including Section 5.3, but subject to compliance with this
Section 5.4, prior to obtaining the Sarg Stockholder Approval (in the case of Sarg) or the Cardinal Shareholder Approval (in the
case of Cardinal) and following the receipt of a bona fide written Competing Proposal made after the date hereof that was not,
directly or indirectly, solicited, initiated or knowingly encouraged in violation of this Section 5.4, the Sarg Board or the Cardinal
Board, as applicable, may effect a Sarg Adverse Recommendation Change within the meaning of clauses (x), (y) and (z)(2) of the
definition thereof or a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change within the meaning of clauses (x), (y) and (z)(2) of the
definition thereof, as applicable or terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(c)(iv) or Section 7.1(d)(iv) , as applicable, or both, but in each case if and only if (i) the Sarg Board or the Cardinal
Board, as applicable, concludes in good faith, after consultation with Sarg's or Cardinal's outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (ii) the Cardinal Board or the Sarg Board, as
applicable, provides the other party five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action (a "Competing
Proposal Notice"), which notice shall include the information with respect to such Competing Proposal that is specified in
Section 5.4(c), as well as a copy of such Competing Proposal (it being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by a party nor
any public announcement thereof that such party determines it is required to make under applicable Law shall constitute a Sarg
Adverse Recommendation Change or a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, unless and until such party shall
have failed at or prior to the end of the period referred to in clause (iii) below (and, upon the occurrence of such failure, such notice
and such public announcement shall constitute a Sarg Adverse Recommendation Change or a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable) to publicly announce that it (A) is recommending the Transactions and (B) has determined that such other
Competing Proposal (taking into account (x) any modifications or adjustments made to the Transactions agreed to by the other
party in writing and (y) any modifications or adjustments made to such other Competing Proposal) is not a Superior Proposal and
has publicly rejected such Competing Proposal); (iii) during the five (5) Business Days following such written notice (the
"Negotiation Period"), if requested by the other party, the Board of Directors of the applicable Party proposing to effect the
recommendation change and its Representatives have negotiated in good faith with the other party regarding any revisions to the
terms of the Transactions proposed by the other party in response to such Competing Proposal; and (iv) at the end of the
Negotiation Period, the Sarg Board or Cardinal Board, as applicable, concludes in good faith, after consultation with Sarg's or
Cardinal's outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this
Agreement to which the other party has agreed in

consultation with Sarg's or Cardinal's outside legal counsel, as applicable, that the failure to make such a Sarg Adverse
Recommendation Change or Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, would be inconsistent with the exercise, in
the case of the Sarg Board, of the directors' duties to Sarg under applicable Law or, in the case of the Cardinal Board, of the
directors' fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Cardinal under applicable Law. Any material amendment or modification to any
Competing Proposal shall require a new Competing Proposal Notice and the Negotiation Period shall be extended by an additional
three (3) Business Days from the date of receipt of such new Competing Proposal Notice.

        (c)   In addition to the obligations of Cardinal and Sarg set forth in Section 5.4(a) and Section 5.4(b), Cardinal or Sarg, as
applicable, shall promptly, and in any event no later than 24 hours, after it (x) receives (i) any Competing Proposal, (ii) any request
for non-public information relating to Cardinal or Sarg or their respective Subsidiaries other than requests for information in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and unrelated to a Competing Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or request for
discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal or (y) responds thereto, notify the other party orally and in writing
of any of the foregoing occurrences, the identity of the Person making such request, inquiry or Competing Proposal and a copy of
such request, inquiry, response or Competing Proposal (or where no such copy is available, a reasonably detailed description of
such request, inquiry, response or Competing Proposal), including any modifications thereto. Each party shall keep the other party
reasonably informed (orally and in writing) on a current basis (and in any event at the other party's request and otherwise no later
than 24 hours after the occurrence of any material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of any request,
inquiry, response or Competing Proposal (including the terms and conditions thereof and of any modification thereto), and any
material developments, discussions and negotiations, including furnishing copies of any written inquiries, material correspondence
and draft documentation, and written summaries of any material oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting the foregoing, each
party shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify the other party orally and in writing if it determines to begin
providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Competing Proposal pursuant to Section 5.4. Each
of Cardinal and Sarg agrees that, subject to applicable restrictions under applicable Law, it shall, prior to or concurrent with the
time it is provided to any third parties, provide to the other party any non-public information concerning Cardinal or Sarg and their
respective Subsidiaries that Cardinal or Sarg provided to any third party in connection with any Competing Proposal which was not
previously provided to the other party.

        (d)   Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.4 to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Cardinal Shareholder
Approval or the Sarg Stockholder Approval, as applicable, the Cardinal Board or the Sarg Board, as applicable, may make a
Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change or a Sarg Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, if (i) such board
determines that an Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing and (ii) such board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel) that the failure to make a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change or a Sarg Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable, in response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with the directors' duties to Sarg under
applicable Law (in the case of the Sarg Board) or the directors' fiduciary duties to its shareholders under applicable Law (in the
case of the Cardinal Board), as applicable; provided that (x) the Cardinal Board or the Sarg Board, as applicable, has given the
other party at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action and specifying in reasonable
detail the circumstances related to such determination and (y) prior to effecting a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change or a
Sarg Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, the applicable party has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to

enable such party to revise the terms of this Agreement, such that the failure to make such a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation
Change or a Sarg Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, would not be inconsistent with the directors' duties under
applicable Law.

        (e)   Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Cardinal Board or the Sarg Board from (i) taking and disclosing to
their shareholders, as applicable, a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any
disclosure to their shareholders, as applicable, if the Sarg Board or Cardinal Board, as applicable, determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the directors' duties to
shareholders under, or would violate applicable Law; or (iii) making accurate disclosure to their shareholders, as applicable, of
factual information regarding the business, financial condition or results of operations of Cardinal or Sarg or the fact that a
Competing Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal (and
such disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change or a Sarg Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable), so long as (A) any such disclosure includes the Cardinal Recommendation or the Sarg Recommendation, as
applicable, without any modification or qualification thereof and continues the prior recommendation of the Cardinal Board or
Sarg Board, as the case may be, and (B) does not contain either an express Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change or an
express Sarg Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, or any other statements by or on behalf of the Board of Directors of
such party which would reasonably be expected to have the same effect as a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change or a Sarg
Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable.

        (f)    Any failure of Cardinal's or Sarg's respective Subsidiaries or its and their respective Representatives to fully comply with
this Section 5.4 (as if such Subsidiaries or Representatives were directly subject to this Section 5.4) shall be deemed a breach of
this Section 5.4 by Cardinal or Sarg, as applicable.

        (g)   For purposes of this Agreement:

          (i)  "Competing Proposal" shall mean, other than the Transactions, any proposal, offer or inquiry from a third party
relating to (A) a merger, reorganization, sale or license of assets, share exchange, tender offer, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving Cardinal or Sarg, as
applicable, or any of their respective Subsidiaries; (B) the acquisition (whether by merger, consolidation, equity
investment, joint venture or otherwise) by any Person of twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets of
Cardinal or Sarg, as applicable, and their respective Subsidiaries, as determined on a book-value or fair-market-value basis;
(C) the purchase or acquisition, in any manner, directly or indirectly, by any Person of twenty percent (20%) or more of the
issued and outstanding shares of the Cardinal Common Stock or the Sarg Common Stock, as applicable, or any other
Equity Interests in Cardinal or Sarg, as applicable, (D) any purchase, acquisition, tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any Person or "group" (as defined pursuant to Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of the shares of Cardinal Common Stock or Sarg Common Stock, as
applicable or any other Equity Interests of Cardinal, Sarg or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (E) any combination of
the foregoing.

         (ii)  "Intervening Event" means any positive material event, development or change in circumstances that first occurs,
arises or becomes known to Cardinal or Sarg, as applicable, or its respective Board of Directors after the date of this
Agreement, to the extent that such event, development or change in circumstances was not known or reasonably
foreseeable as of

the date of this Agreement (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the probability of magnitude of consequences of which
were not known or reasonably foreseeable); provided, however, that in no event shall the following events, developments
or changes in circumstances constitute an Intervening Event: (1) the receipt, existence or terms of a Competing Proposal or
any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof; (2) any change in the price, or change in trading volume, of Cardinal
Common Stock or Sarg Common Stock, as applicable (provided, however, that the exception set forth in this clause (2)
shall not apply to the underlying causes giving rise to or contributing to such change or prevent any of such underlying
causes from being taken into account in determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred); (3) meeting or exceeding
internal or analysts' expectations, projections or results of operations (provided, however, that the exception set forth in this
clause (3) shall not apply to the underlying causes giving rise to or contributing to such circumstances or prevent any of
such underlying causes from being taken into account in determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred); and
(4) any action taken by either party pursuant to and in compliance with the affirmative covenants set forth in Section 5.6,
and the consequences of any such action.

        (iii)  "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Competing Proposal (except the references therein to "20%" shall
be replaced by "80%") made by a third party which was not solicited by Cardinal or Sarg or any of their respective
Representatives and which, in the good faith judgment of the Cardinal Board or the Sarg Board, as applicable, and after
consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, taking into account the various legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of the Competing Proposal, including the financing terms thereof, and the third party making such Competing
Proposal in addition to such other factors as the Cardinal Board or the Sarg Board, as applicable, considers to be
appropriate, (A) if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, and (B) if consummated, would result in a transaction
that is more favorable to Cardinal's shareholders or Sarg stockholders, as applicable, from a financial point of view, than
the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated hereby (after giving effect to all adjustments or modifications to the
terms thereof which may be agreed in writing to be made by the other party (including pursuant to Section 5.4(b))) and
(C) if a cash transaction (in whole or in part), financing for which is then fully committed or reasonably determined to be
available.

        5.5    Access to Information; Confidentiality.     

        (a)   Upon reasonable notice, each of Cardinal and Sarg shall (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and
Representatives to) afford to the other party and its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, Contracts and records and its officers, employees and
Representatives and, during such period, each of Cardinal and Sarg shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to)
furnish promptly to the other party (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed, published,
announced or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of applicable securities Laws (other than reports or

applicable Law, all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably request;
provided, however, none of Cardinal or Sarg or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be required to provide
access to or disclose information where such information or access would, in the reasonable judgment of such party, (x) breach any
agreement with any third party, (y) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by such party or (z) otherwise
violate any applicable Law. In the event any of the restrictions in clauses (x) through (z) of the foregoing sentence shall apply, the

additional specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive material and to ensure compliance with applicable Laws.
Any such information provided pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall be held in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance
with, the provisions of that certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated September 1, 2017 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"),
between Cardinal and Sarg, which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

        (b)   No investigation by any of the parties or their respective Representatives shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of any other party set forth herein.

        5.6    Appropriate Action.     

        (a)   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to cooperate and use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and
applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) obtain all necessary consents,

as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any Proceeding by, any Governmental Entity or Educational
Agency (including, the Cardinal Pre-Closing Educational Consents and the Sarg Pre-Closing Educational Consents (if any) and in
connection with the HSR Act), and (iii) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions
and fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement; provided that in no event shall the "reasonable best efforts" of any party include
the obligation to defend or prosecute any suit, arbitration or other adversarial proceeding (in each case, whether judicial, arbitral or
administrative) by or against any Governmental Entity or any Educational Agency. Each of the parties shall furnish to each other
party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing. Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, Cardinal and Sarg shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each party shall consult with the other party in connection with, all of the information
relating to Cardinal or Sarg, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity or Educational Agency in connection with the
Merger and the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that materials may be redacted (i) to remove

Change or a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, and otherwise not in violation of Section 5.4. Cardinal and Sarg
agree that the press release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release in the form heretofore agreed
by the parties. In addition, subject to the right of the Cardinal Board to make a Cardinal Adverse Recommendation Change or the Sarg
Board to make a Sarg Adverse Recommendation Change, in each case in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of
Section 5.4, Cardinal and Sarg agree to cause their respective directors and officers to refrain from taking any position in any public
statement that is (a) contrary to the positions previously taken by Sarg and Cardinal with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Merger, or (b) reasonably likely to have an material adverse impact on the ability of the parties hereto to consummate the

        5.9    Indemnification.

harmless, and shall advance expenses as incurred, to the fullest extent permitted under (i) applicable Law, (ii) Cardinal's and Sarg's
organizational documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (iii) any Contract of Cardinal, Sarg or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement, each present and former director and officer of Cardinal, Sarg
and any of their respective Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (each, an "Indemnitee" and, collectively, the
"Indemnitees") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in connection
with this Agreement or the Transactions.

        (b)   Sarg agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or
otherwise in respect of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions) now existing in favor of an Indemnitee as provided in its articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
documents shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of no
less than six (6) years from the Effective Time, Sarg shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall,
maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the organizational documents of
Cardinal, Sarg or any of their respective Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who
immediately before the Effective Time were current or former directors or officers of Cardinal, Sarg or any of their respective
Subsidiaries; provided, however, that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any
Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

        (c)   Prior to the Effective Time, Cardinal shall purchase a "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance policy with
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable to the
insured Persons in the aggregate with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events that occurred before or at the Effective
Time (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the other Transactions) than the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by Cardinal if the cost thereof does not exceed 300% of the last
annual premium paid by Cardinal for the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by Cardinal
before the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that if Cardinal is unable to so

acquire such a "tail" policy then Sarg shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for at least six (6) years after the
Effective Time the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by Cardinal or policies with coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous insured Persons with respect to claims arising out of or
relating to events that occurred before or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and the other Transactions) so long as Cardinal or the Surviving Corporation are not required to pay an aggregate
premium in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by Sarg for such insurance before the date of this Agreement (such
300% amount being the "Maximum Premium"). If Cardinal is unable to obtain the "tail" policy and Sarg or the Surviving
Corporation are unable to obtain the insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less than or equal to the Maximum
Premium, then Sarg shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium.

        (d)   In the event that either Sarg or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each case, Sarg shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper provision to be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

        (e)   The provisions of this Section 5.9 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee,
his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such individual may have under Cardinal's, Sarg's or any of their respective Subsidiaries' organizational
documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any Contract of Cardinal, Sarg or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
effect as of the date of this Agreement. The obligations of Sarg and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.9 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 5.9 applies unless
(x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to
such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.9 applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9).

        (f)    Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors'
and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to Cardinal, Sarg or any of their
respective Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors or officers, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this Section 5.9 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

        5.10    Stock Exchange Listing.     Sarg shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Sarg Common Stock to be issued in
connection with the Merger (including shares of Sarg Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of Sarg Stock Options or vesting of Sarg
Restricted Stock Awards, Sarg Performance Restricted Stock Awards, Sarg RSUs or Sarg Performance Units), to be listed on the
NASDAQ (or such other stock exchange as may be mutually agreed upon by Cardinal and Sarg), subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the respective Effective Time.

        5.11    Section 16 Matters.     Prior to the Effective Time, Cardinal and Sarg shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Cardinal Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Cardinal Common Stock) or acquisitions of Sarg
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Sarg Common Stock) resulting from the Transactions by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Cardinal, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

of any litigation brought by shareholders of Cardinal or stockholders of Sarg or in the name of Cardinal or Sarg against Cardinal or Sarg,
as applicable, and/or their respective directors relating to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger
("Transaction Litigation"); provided, however, that no party shall compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to
compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any litigation arising or resulting from the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or consent to the same, without the prior written consent of the other party (not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned of

        5.13    Tax Matters.     

        (a)   Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. None of the parties shall (and each of the parties shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
not to) take any action, or fail to take any action, that could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties shall consider in good faith such amendments to
this Agreement as may be reasonably required to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code (it being understood that no party will be required to agree to any such amendment).

        (b)   Each of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Tax opinions to be attached as exhibits to the Joint
Proxy Statement and the Form S-4 and the Tax opinions described in Sections 6.2(d) and 6.3(d), including by (i) delivering to
Kirkland & Ellis LLP and Latham & Watkins LLP, prior to the filing of the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, tax
representation letters in substantially the forms set forth in Section 5.13(b)(i) of the Sarg Disclosure Schedule and Section 5.13(b)

dated and executed as of the dates of such Tax opinions, tax representation letters in substantially the forms set forth in
Section 5.13(b)(ii) of the Sarg Disclosure Schedule and Section 5.13(b)(ii) of the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule, respectively. Each
of the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts not to, and not permit any affiliate to, take or cause to be taken any action that
would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which inaction would cause to be untrue) any of the
representations and covenants made to counsel in the tax representation letters described in this Section 5.13(b).

        (c)   This Agreement is intended to constitute, and the parties hereto adopt this Agreement as, a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Sections 354, 361 and 368 of the Code. The parties shall treat the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code for United States federal, state and other relevant Tax purposes, unless otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

        5.14    Employee Matters.    

        (a)   Sarg and Cardinal agree to the general terms set forth on Section 5.14(a) of the Cardinal Disclosure Schedule. To the
extent permitted by applicable Laws, Sarg shall credit, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to credit, each
employee of Sarg, Cardinal or any of their respective Subsidiaries as of the Closing (including any employee who is full-time, part-
time, temporary, on vacation or on a medical or disability or any other paid or unpaid approved leave of absence) who continues
employment with Sarg or the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date (each, a "Continuing Employee") with his or her
years of service with Sarg, Cardinal or any of their respective Subsidiaries and predecessor entities, under any employee benefit
plans, programs and arrangements in which such Continuing Employee participates following the Closing (the "Post-Closing
Plan"), to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such service
under any similar Sarg Benefit Plan or Cardinal

Benefit Plan, for purposes of eligibility for participation and vesting (but not accrual of benefits, other than for purposes of
determining the level of vacation, travel and/or severance benefits), except to the extent such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no service prior to the Closing Date shall be required to be credited for the
purpose of benefit accrual or eligibility for any defined benefit pension plan, early retirement benefits or subsidies or participation
under any defined benefit pension plan, nor for purposes of eligibility or participation under any retiree medical plan.

        (b)   In addition, and without limiting the generality of Section 5.14(a), this Section 5.14(b) or any other provisions herein,
(i) for purposes of each Post-Closing Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or other health benefits to any
Continuing Employee and his or her dependents, Sarg shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
(i) cause all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work
requirements of such Post-Closing Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the
extent any such waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work
requirements were waived or were inapplicable under the comparable Sarg Benefit Plan or Cardinal Benefit Plan, (ii) fully credit
each Continuing Employee with all deductible payments, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under the medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefit plans of Sarg
or Cardinal (or their respective Subsidiaries), as applicable, prior to the Closing during the plan year in which the Closing occurs
for the purpose of determining the extent to which such Continuing Employee has satisfied the deductible, co-payments, or
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for such plan
year under any Pre-Closing Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision or health benefits, as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such plan, and (iii) credit the accounts of such Continuing Employees under any Post-Closing Plan that is
a flexible spending plan with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under the applicable Sarg Benefit
Plan or Cardinal Benefit Plan.

        (c)   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Continuing Employee who satisfies the eligibility requirements of a
Sarg Benefit Plan or a Cardinal Benefit Plan that is a 401(k) plan shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan maintained by
Sarg or the Surviving Corporation following the Closing (each, a "Post-Closing 401(k) Plan") and shall be credited with eligibility
service and vesting service for all periods of service with Sarg and Cardinal, and their respective Subsidiaries to the extent so
credited with such service under the applicable 401(k) plan as of the Closing Date. Additionally, in the event Sarg or any of its
Subsidiaries freezes a 401(k) plan after the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee who participates in such frozen plan shall,
following such action, become eligible to participate in a Post-Closing 401(k) Plan.

        (d)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5.14 or otherwise in this Agreement, no provision of
this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Sarg or the
Surviving Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason in their sole business discretion, (ii) to establish,
amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement (including any Sarg Benefit Plan or Cardinal Benefit
Plan), or (iii) require Sarg or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to continue any Sarg Benefit Plan or Cardinal
Benefit Plan or prevent or interfere with the rights of Sarg, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries with respect to
the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time. The provisions of this Section 5.14 are solely for the
benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be
regarded for any purpose as a

in a judgment against such party for such amounts, such party shall pay interest on such amounts from the date payment of such
amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the rate equal to the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal for the
relevant period, together with the costs and expenses of the other party (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event that the Cardinal Termination
Fee or the Sarg Termination Fee is payable and actually paid to Cardinal or Sarg in accordance with this Section 7.3, payment of
such Cardinal Termination Fee or Sarg Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the non-
terminating party and its affiliates against any other party or such other party's shareholders, directors, officers, affiliates and other
Representatives, for any loss or damage based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance hereof or the Transactions contemplated hereby, except in the case of Willful Breach or fraud. Solely for purposes of
establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and without in any way increasing the amount of the Cardinal Termination Fee or the
Sarg Termination Fee, expanding the circumstances in which the Cardinal Termination Fee or the Sarg Termination Fee, as
applicable, is to be paid or restricting or modifying the other rights of any party hereunder, in the event of the valid termination of
this Agreement under circumstances in which the Cardinal Termination Fee or the Sarg Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this
Section 7.3, it is agreed that each of the Cardinal Termination Fee and the Sarg Termination Fee is liquidated damages, and not a
penalty, and the payment thereof in such circumstances is supported by due and sufficient consideration; provided, that no payment
of a Cardinal Termination Fee or a Sarg Termination Fee shall be considered in lieu of, or a replacement or substitution for,
damages incurred in the event of any Willful Breach or fraud.

        7.4    Amendment or Supplement.     This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented by the parties by action taken or
authorized by their respective Boards of Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Cardinal Shareholder
Approval or the Sarg Stockholder Approval has been obtained; provided, that after the Cardinal Shareholder Approval or the Sarg
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment shall be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or
adoption by the shareholders of Cardinal or stockholders of Sarg without such further approval or adoption. This Agreement may not be
amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing
specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the time of the amendment.

        7.5    Extension of Time; Waiver.     At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties may, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties set forth in this Agreement
or any document delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties
contained herein; provided, that after the Cardinal Shareholder Approval or the Sarg Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no waiver
may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by the shareholders of Cardinal or stockholders of
Sarg, as applicable, without such further approval or adoption. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any
party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and
are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder.

meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

        8.6    Severability.     If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of
Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions
are fulfilled to the extent possible.

        8.7    Entire Agreement.     This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, the Cardinal Disclosure Schedules, the Sarg Disclosure
Schedules and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the
parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly provided herein or therein, are not intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder. Each of Cardinal and Sarg acknowledge and agree that each such party, as applicable, has not
relied upon or otherwise been induced by any express or implied representations or warranties other than those set forth in Article 3 (in the
case of Cardinal) and Article 4 (in the case of Sarg).

        8.8    Assignment.     Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other parties, and
any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

        8.9    Parties in Interest.     This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties and their respective
successors and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other than pursuant to Section 5.9, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

        8.10    Mutual Drafting; Interpretation.     Each party has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each party
acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring
any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the singular number
shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement,
the words "include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." As used in this Agreement, references to a "party" or the "parties" are intended to refer to a
party to this Agreement or the parties to this Agreement. Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to "Sections,"

hereunder, to the extent signed and delivered by facsimile or by email with scan attachment, shall be treated in all manner and respects as
an original contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered
in person. At the request of any party, each other party shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No
party shall raise the use of facsimile or email to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or Contract was transmitted or
communicated by facsimile or email with scan attachment as a defense to the formation of a legally binding contract, and each such party
forever waives any such defense.

performance or injunctive relief, the defense of adequacy of remedies at Law and any requirement under Law to post a bond or other
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

October 29, 2017 

Board of Directors
Capella Education Company
Capella Tower
225 South 6th Street, 9th Floor
Minneapolis, MN 55402

Members of the Board:

        We understand that Capella Education Company (the "Company"), Strayer Education, Inc. ("Strayer") and Sarg Sub Inc., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Strayer ("Merger Sub"), propose to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, substantially in the form of the draft
dated October 27, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), which provides, among other things, for the merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub with
and into the Company. Pursuant to the Merger, the Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Strayer, and each outstanding
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), other than shares held in treasury or
held by Strayer, the Company or Merger Sub, or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries (the "Excluded Shares"), will be
converted into the right to receive 0.875 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Strayer (the
"Strayer Common Stock"), subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The terms and conditions of the Merger are more fully set forth
in the Merger Agreement.

        You have asked for our opinion as to whether the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of
view to the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the Excluded Shares).

        For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have:

1) Reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information of the Company and
Strayer, respectively; 

2) Reviewed certain internal financial statements and other financial and operating data concerning the Company and Strayer,
respectively; 

3) Reviewed certain financial projections prepared by the managements of the Company and Strayer, respectively; 

4) Reviewed information relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the Merger, prepared
by the managements of the Company and Strayer; 

5) Discussed the past and current operations and financial condition and the prospects of the Company, including information
relating to certain strategic, financial and operational benefits anticipated from the Merger, with senior executives of the
Company; 

6) Reviewed the reported prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock and the Strayer Common Stock; 

7) Compared the financial performance of the Company and Strayer and the prices and trading activity of the Company
Common Stock and Strayer Common Stock with that of certain other publicly-traded companies comparable with the
Company and Strayer, respectively, and their securities;

8) Reviewed the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain comparable acquisition transactions; 

9) Participated in certain discussions and negotiations among representatives of the Company and Strayer and certain parties
and their financial and legal advisors; 

10) Reviewed the Merger Agreement and certain related documents; and 

11) Performed such other analyses, reviewed such other information and considered such other factors as we have deemed
appropriate.

        We have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the information that was
publicly available or supplied or otherwise made available to us by the Company and Strayer, and formed a substantial basis for this
opinion. We have assumed that the financial projections provided to us have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best
currently available estimates and judgments of the respective managements of the Company and Strayer of the future financial
performance of the Company and Strayer. We have assumed that information and projections relating to strategic, financial and operational
benefits anticipated from the Merger have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and
judgments of the managements of the Company and Strayer. We have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment by the
managements of the Company and Strayer of: (i) the strategic, financial and other benefits expected to result from the Merger; (ii) the
timing and risks associated with the integration of the Company and Strayer and (iii) their ability to retain key employees of the Company
and Strayer, respectively. In addition, we have assumed that the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the terms set forth in the
Merger Agreement without any waiver, amendment or delay of any terms or conditions, including, among other things, that the Merger
will be treated as a tax-free reorganization, pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We have assumed that the
definitive Merger Agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft thereof furnished to us. Morgan Stanley has assumed
that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary governmental, quasi-governmental, regulatory or other approvals and consents
required for the proposed Merger, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed that would have a material adverse
effect on the contemplated benefits expected to be derived in the proposed Merger. We are not legal, tax or regulatory advisors. We are
financial advisors only and have relied upon, without independent verification, the assessment of the Company and its legal, tax or
regulatory advisors with respect to legal, tax or regulatory matters. We express no opinion with respect to the fairness of the amount or
nature of the compensation to any of the Company's officers, directors or employees, or any class of such persons, relative to the
consideration to be received by the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock in the transaction. We have not made any
independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities of the Company or Strayer, nor have we been furnished with any such
valuations or appraisals. Our opinion does not address the relative merits of the Merger as compared to any other alternative business
transaction, or other alternatives, or whether or not such alternatives could be achieved or are available. Our opinion is necessarily based
on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof. Events
occurring after the date hereof may affect this opinion and the assumptions used in preparing it, and we do not assume any obligation to
update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

        We have acted as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with this transaction and will receive a fee
for our services, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this financial opinion and a significant portion of which is contingent
upon the closing of the Merger. In the two years prior to the date hereof, we have not provided financial advisory or financing services for
the Company or Strayer. Morgan Stanley may seek to provide financial advisory and financing services to the Company or Strayer and
their respective affiliates in the future and would expect to receive fees for the rendering of these services.

ANNEX D 

October 27, 2017

The Board of Directors
Strayer Education, Inc.
2303 Dulles Station Blvd.
Herndon, VA 20171

Members of the Board of Directors:

        We understand that Strayer Education, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), Sarg Sub Inc., a Minnesota corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and Capella Education Company, a Minnesota corporation ("Capella"), propose to enter into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") which provides for, among other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into
Capella (the "Transaction"), as a result of which Capella will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and each outstanding
share of common stock of Capella, $0.01 par value per share ("Capella Common Stock"), that is not owned by Capella, the Company,
Merger Sub or any wholly owned subsidiary of Capella, the Company or Merger Sub will be converted into the right to receive 0.875 (the
"Exchange Ratio") shares of common stock of the Company, $0.01 par value per share ("Company Common Stock"). The terms and
conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Merger Agreement.

        You have requested our opinion as to the fairness from a financial point of view to the Company, of the Exchange Ratio provided for
in the Merger Agreement.

        For purposes of the opinion set forth herein, we have, among other things:

1. reviewed certain publicly available financial statements and other business and financial information with respect to the
Company and Capella, including research analyst reports; 

2. reviewed certain internal financial information, analyses, forecasts (the "Company Forecasts") and other financial and
operating data relating to the business of the Company, in each case, prepared by management of the Company; 

3. reviewed certain internal financial information, analyses, forecasts (the "Capella Forecasts") and other financial and
operating data relating to the business of Capella, in each case, prepared by management of Capella and approved for our
use by management of the Company; 

4. reviewed certain publicly available financial forecasts relating to the Company; 

5. reviewed certain publicly available financial forecasts relating to Capella; 

6. reviewed estimates of synergies anticipated by the Company's management to result from the Transaction (collectively, the
"Anticipated Synergies");

7. discussed the past and current business, operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company, including the
Anticipated Synergies, with management of the Company, and discussed the past and current business, operations,
financial condition and prospects of Capella with management of the Company; 

8. reviewed the relative financial contributions of the Company and Capella to the future financial performance of the
Company on a pro forma basis; 

9. compared the financial performance of the Company and Capella with that of certain publicly-traded companies which we
believe to be generally relevant; 

10. compared the financial terms of the Transaction with the publicly available financial terms of certain transactions which we
believe to be generally relevant; 

11. reviewed the historical trading prices and trading activity for the Company Common Stock and the Capella Common
Stock, and compared such price and trading activity of the shares of Company Common Stock and Capella Common Stock
with each other and with that of securities of certain publicly-traded companies which we believe to be generally relevant; 

12. participated in discussions with representatives of the Company and its and Capella's respective advisors; 

13. reviewed a draft dated October 27, 2017 of the Merger Agreement; and 

14. conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations, and considered such other factors, as we have deemed
appropriate.

        In arriving at our opinion, we have assumed and relied upon, without independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of the
financial and other information supplied or otherwise made available to us (including information that is available from generally
recognized public sources) for purposes of this opinion and have further relied upon the assurances of the management of the Company
that, to their knowledge, the information furnished, or approved for our use, by them for purposes of our analysis does not contain any
material omissions or misstatements of material fact. We have assumed with your consent that there are no material undisclosed liabilities
of the Company or Capella for which adequate reserves or other provisions have not been made. With respect to the Company Forecasts,
we have been advised by the management of the Company and have assumed, with your consent, that they have been reasonably prepared
on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of the Company as to the future
stand-alone financial performance of the Company and the future financial performance of the Company and Capella taken together
(except to the extent of inputs therein based solely on the Capella Forecasts, as further addressed in the next two sentences), as the case
may be, and the other matters covered thereby and we express no view as to the assumptions on which they are based. With respect to the
Capella Forecasts, we have assumed, with your consent, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently
available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of Capella as to the future stand-alone financial performance of Capella
and the other matters covered thereby and we express no view as to the assumptions on which they are based. We have relied upon the
assessment by management of the Company that the Capella Forecasts have been reasonably prepared. We have assumed, with your
consent, that the Anticipated Synergies and potential strategic implications and operational benefits (including the amount, timing and
achievability thereof) anticipated by management of the Company to result from the Transaction will be realized in the amounts and at the
times projected by management of the Company, and we express no view as to the assumptions on which they are based. We have relied
without independent verification upon the

assessment by the management of the Company of the timing and risks associated with the integration of the Company and Capella. In
arriving at our opinion, we have not made any independent valuation or appraisal of the assets or liabilities (including any contingent,
derivative or off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of the Company or Capella, nor have we been furnished with any such valuations or
appraisals, nor have we assumed any obligation to conduct, nor have we conducted, any physical inspection of the properties or facilities
of the Company or Capella. In addition, we have not evaluated the solvency of any party to the Merger Agreement, including under any
state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. We have assumed that the final Merger Agreement will
not differ in any material respect from the form of Merger Agreement reviewed by us and that the Transaction will be consummated in
accordance with the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, without material modification, waiver or delay. In addition, we have
assumed that in connection with the receipt of all the necessary approvals of the proposed Transaction, no delays, limitations, conditions or
restrictions will be imposed that could have an adverse effect on the Company, Capella or the contemplated benefits expected to be derived
in the proposed Transaction. We have relied as to all legal matters relevant to rendering our opinion upon the advice of counsel.

        This opinion addresses only the fairness from a financial point of view, as of the date hereof, of the Exchange Ratio provided for in
the Merger Agreement to the Company. We have not been asked to, nor do we, offer any opinion as to any other term of the Merger
Agreement or any other document contemplated by or entered into in connection with the Merger Agreement or the form or structure of
the Transaction or the likely timeframe in which the Transaction will be consummated. In addition, we express no opinion as to the
fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be received by any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger
Agreement, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the Exchange Ratio or otherwise. We do not express any opinion as to any tax
or other consequences that may result from the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or any other related document, nor
does our opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which we understand the Company has received such
advice as it deems necessary from qualified professionals. Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company
to enter into the Transaction or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared with any other strategic alternative which may be
available to the Company. We have not been authorized to solicit, and have not solicited, indications of interest in a transaction with the
Company from any party.

        We have acted as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Transaction and will receive a fee for our services, a
portion of which we have received, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a significant portion of which is
contingent upon consummation of the Transaction. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse us for certain expenses, and
indemnify us for certain liabilities and other items, that may arise out of our engagement. Perella Weinberg Partners LP and its affiliates
may in the future provide investment banking and other financial services to the Company and Capella and their respective affiliates and in
the future may receive compensation for the rendering of such services. In the ordinary course of our business activities, Perella Weinberg
Partners LP or its affiliates may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions, for their own
account or the accounts of customers or clients, in debt or equity or other securities (or related derivative securities) or financial
instruments (including bank loans or other obligations) of the Company or Capella or any of their respective affiliates. The issuance of this
opinion was approved by a fairness opinion committee of Perella Weinberg Partners LP.

        This opinion is for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with, and for the purposes
of its evaluation of, the Transaction. This opinion is not intended to be and does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of
Company Common Stock or Capella Common Stock as to how such holders should vote or otherwise act with respect to the proposed
Transaction or any other matter and does not in any manner address the prices at which shares of Company Common Stock or Capella
Common Stock will trade at any time. In addition, we express no opinion as to the fairness of the Transaction to, or any consideration
received in connection with the Transaction by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the
Company. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made
available to us as of, the date hereof. It should be understood that subsequent developments may affect this opinion and the assumptions
used in preparing it, and we do not have any obligation to update, revise, or reaffirm this opinion.

        Based upon and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions and limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion
that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio provided for in the Merger Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to the Company.
