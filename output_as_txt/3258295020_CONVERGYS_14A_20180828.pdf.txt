MERGER PROPOSAL—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT
August 28, 2018

Dear SYNNEX Corporation Stockholders and Convergys Corporation Shareholders:

On behalf of the boards of directors of SYNNEX Corporation (“SYNNEX”) and Convergys Corporation (“Convergys”), we
are pleased to enclose the joint proxy statement/prospectus relating to the initial merger of Delta Merger Sub I, Inc. (“Merger Sub
I”), a wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX, with and into Convergys, with Convergys surviving the initial merger, and the
subsequent merger of Convergys with and into Concentrix CVG Corporation (“Merger Sub II”), with Merger Sub II surviving the
subsequent merger, pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement entered into among SYNNEX, Convergys, Merger Sub I and
Merger Sub II on June 28, 2018, as amended on August 22, 2018.

If the mergers are completed, Convergys shareholders will receive (i) $13.25 in cash and (ii) 0.1193 shares of SYNNEX
common stock, subject to adjustment as provided in the merger agreement in the event that the trading price of SYNNEX
common stock prior to the closing of the mergers increases or decreases by more than 10% from a base price of $111.0766,
for each Convergys common share, as described in more detail in the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus under
the heading “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration.” The fraction of a share of SYNNEX common stock into which
each Convergys common share will be converted is referred to as the exchange ratio. Based on the closing price of a share of
SYNNEX common stock on August 23, 2018, the most recent trading day prior to the date of the accompanying joint proxy
statement/prospectus for which this information was available, and assuming that such price was the stock price required by the
exchange ratio calculations, the applicable exchange ratio would be 0.1237, and the merger consideration would represent
approximately $25.18 in value per Convergys common share. The value of the consideration to be received by Convergys
shareholders will fluctuate with changes in the price of the SYNNEX common stock. We urge you to obtain current market
quotations for SYNNEX common stock and Convergys common shares. SYNNEX common stock and Convergys common shares
are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbols “SNX” and “CVG,” respectively. In connection with the mergers,
SYNNEX stockholders are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of stockholders of SYNNEX to be held on October 3, 2018
at its offices at 44201 Nobel Drive, Fremont, California 94538 at 10:00 a.m. (Pacific Time), and Convergys shareholders are
cordially invited to attend a special meeting of shareholders of Convergys to be held on October 3, 2018 at the Atrium One
Building, 201 East Fourth Street, Suite 350, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202, at 1:00 p.m. (local time).

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. We cannot complete the mergers and the
merger consideration will not be paid unless (i) SYNNEX stockholders approve the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common
stock in connection with the initial merger and (ii) Convergys shareholders adopt the merger agreement. Approval of the
issuance of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the initial merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the
votes cast at the SYNNEX special meeting and adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of
at least two thirds of the outstanding Convergys common shares entitled to vote thereon. Every vote counts.

At the special meeting of stockholders of SYNNEX, SYNNEX stockholders will be asked to vote on (i) a proposal to approve
the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the initial merger and (ii) a proposal to adjourn the SYNNEX
special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof, to approve the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the initial
merger.

SYNNEX’ board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in
connection with the initial merger, are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of SYNNEX stockholders and
unanimously recommends that SYNNEX stockholders vote (i) FOR the approval of the issuance of shares of SYNNEX
common stock in connection with the initial merger and (ii) FOR the adjournment of the SYNNEX special meeting if
necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting, or any adjournment
or postponement thereof, to approve the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the initial merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

At the special meeting of shareholders of Convergys, Convergys shareholders will be asked to vote on (i) a proposal to adopt
the merger agreement, (ii) a proposal to adjourn from time to time the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional
proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, to adopt the
merger agreement, and (iii) a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may be paid or
provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers.

Convergys’ board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Convergys
shareholders and unanimously recommends that Convergys shareholders vote (i) FOR the adoption of the merger
agreement, (ii) FOR the adjournment from time to time of the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional
proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof, to
adopt the merger agreement, and (iii) FOR the non-binding advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may be
paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers.

We estimate that SYNNEX may issue up to approximately 11,277,434 shares of its common stock to Convergys shareholders
in the initial merger and up to approximately 801,000 shares of its common stock which may be issued upon conversion of
Convergys’ outstanding convertible debentures. Based on the number of SYNNEX common stock outstanding as of August 23,
2018, and the number of Convergys common shares outstanding as of August 23, 2018, the most recent practicable date for which
such information was available, immediately following the completion of the mergers, SYNNEX stockholders immediately prior to
the mergers are expected to own approximately 78% of SYNNEX’ outstanding common stock and former Convergys shareholders
are expected to own approximately 22% of SYNNEX’ outstanding common stock excluding the potential issuance of shares upon
conversion of Convergys’ outstanding convertible debentures.

The accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus provides important information regarding the SYNNEX special meeting
and the Convergys special meeting and a detailed description of the merger agreement, the mergers, SYNNEX’ stock issuance, the
adjournment proposals and non-binding advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may be paid or provided by
Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers. We urge you to read the accompanying joint proxy
statement/prospectus (and any documents incorporated by reference into the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus)
carefully. Please pay particular attention to the section “Risk Factors” beginning on page 53 of the accompanying joint proxy
statement/prospectus. You can also obtain information about SYNNEX and Convergys from documents that SYNNEX and
Convergys previously have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Whether or not you expect to attend your company’s special meeting, the details of which are described in the accompanying
joint proxy statement/prospectus, please immediately submit your proxy by telephone, by the Internet or by completing, signing,
dating and returning your signed proxy card(s) in the enclosed prepaid return envelope so that your shares may be represented at the
applicable special meeting.

If SYNNEX stockholders have any questions or require assistance in voting their shares, they should call SYNNEX, Investor
Relations at (510) 668-8436. If Convergys shareholders have any questions or require assistance in voting their shares, they should
call Innisfree M&A Incorporated, Convergys’ proxy solicitor for its special meeting, with respect to banks and brokers, collect at
(212) 750-5833 and, with respect to shareholders and all others, toll-free at (888) 750-5834.

We hope to see you at the applicable special meeting and look forward to the successful completion of the mergers.
Sincerely,

NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
OF SYNNEX CORPORATION

TO BE HELD ON OCTOBER 3, 2018
10:00 a.m. (Pacific Time)

To the Stockholders of SYNNEX Corporation:

NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that a special meeting of stockholders of SYNNEX Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(“SYNNEX”), will be held at its offices at 44201 Nobel Drive, Fremont, California 94538 on October 3, 2018, at 10:00 a.m.
(Pacific Time), for the following purposes:

1. to consider and vote on a proposal to approve the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, in connection with the first of the two mergers contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June
28, 2018, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 22, 2018, and as it
may be amended from time to time (which is referred to in this notice as the merger agreement), among SYNNEX, Delta
Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX, Concentrix CVG Corporation, a
Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX, and Convergys Corporation, an Ohio corporation (a
copy of the merger agreement is attached as Annex A to the accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus); and

2. to consider and vote on a proposal to approve the adjournment of the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit
additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in
connection with the initial merger at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement
thereof.

SYNNEX’ board of directors has fixed the close of business on August 31, 2018, as the record date for the determination of the
stockholders entitled to vote at the SYNNEX special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Only stockholders of
record at the record date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the SYNNEX special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement
thereof.

A quorum, which is a majority of the outstanding shares as of the record date, must be present to hold the special meeting. A
quorum is calculated based on the number of shares represented by the stockholders attending in person and by their proxy holders.
If you indicate an abstention as your voting preference, your shares will be counted toward a quorum but they will not be voted on
the matter.

Abstentions on any matters are treated as shares present or represented and entitled to vote on that matter and have the same
effect as a vote against such matter.

Brokers who hold shares of SYNNEX common stock for a beneficial owner have the discretion to vote on routine proposals
when they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. If a broker indicates on the enclosed proxy card or its
substitute that such broker does not have discretionary authority to vote on a particular matter (broker non-votes), those shares will
be considered as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum but will not be treated as shares entitled to vote on
that matter. Note that, if you are a beneficial owner and do not provide specific voting instructions to your broker, the broker that
holds your shares will not be authorized to vote on the proposals. Accordingly, we encourage you to provide voting instructions to
your broker, whether or not you plan to attend the SYNNEX special meeting.

Approval of the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the initial merger, including any shares that
may be issued in connection with the potential conversion of the convertible debentures

quorum, as defined under Delaware law, is present). Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of a
majority of the shares present at the SYNNEX special meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote (whether or not a quorum,
as defined under Delaware law, is present).

transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in
connection with the initial merger, are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of SYNNEX stockholders and

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Convergys
common shares entitled to vote thereon. Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Convergys special meeting requires the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least a majority of the Convergys common shares present or represented by proxy at the Convergys special
meeting. Approval of the non-binding advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may be paid or provided by
Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a
majority of the Convergys common shares present or represented by proxy at the Convergys special meeting. Convergys’ board of
directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Convergys and its shareholders, and unanimously recommends that
the Convergys shareholders vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement, “FOR” the adjournment from time to time of the
Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at
the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof and “FOR” the non-binding advisory
proposal to approve compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection
with the mergers.

Under Ohio law, Convergys shareholders who do not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement will have the right
to seek appraisal of the fair cash value of their Convergys common shares as determined by the court of common pleas of the Ohio
county in which the principal office of Convergys is located if the mergers are completed, but only if they submit a written demand
for such an appraisal prior to the vote on the merger proposal and comply with the other Ohio law procedures explained in the
accompanying joint proxy statement/prospectus. Convergys shareholders who do not vote in favor of the merger proposal and who
submit a written demand for such an appraisal prior to the vote on merger proposal and comply with the other Ohio law procedures
will not receive the merger consideration.

By Order of the Board of Directors,

Andrew Farwig

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MERGERS AND THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

The following are some questions that you, as a stockholder of SYNNEX Corporation, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as SYNNEX, or a shareholder of Convergys Corporation, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Convergys, may have regarding the mergers, the stock issuance, the adjournment proposals, the non-
binding advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive
officers in connection with the mergers and the special meetings as well as brief answers to those questions. You are urged to
carefully read this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including all documents incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, and its annexes, in their entirety because this section may not provide all of the information that is important
to you with respect to the mergers, the stock issuance, the adjournment proposals, the non-binding advisory proposal to approve
compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers and
the special meetings. Additional important information is contained in the annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference
into, this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”

Q: Why am I receiving this document and why am I being asked to vote on the merger agreement?

A: SYNNEX and Convergys have agreed to a transaction involving two mergers, pursuant to which Convergys will become a
wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX and will no longer be a publicly held corporation. In order to complete the mergers,
SYNNEX stockholders must vote to approve the issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the initial
merger, which issuance is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the stock issuance, and Convergys shareholders
must vote to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 28, 2018, and amended on August 22, 2018 among
SYNNEX, Convergys, Delta Merger Sub I, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX that is
referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Merger Sub I, and Concentrix CVG Corporation, a Delaware corporation
and wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX that is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Merger Sub II. Merger
Sub I and Merger Sub II are collectively referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Merger Subs and the
foregoing Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended by Amendment No.1 to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
August 22, 2018, and as it may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the merger agreement.

Convergys is holding a special meeting of shareholders, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
Convergys special meeting, in order to obtain the shareholder approval necessary to adopt the merger agreement. Adoption of
the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Convergys
common shares entitled to vote thereon. Convergys shareholders will also be asked to approve the adjournment from time to
time of the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the
merger agreement at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, and to approve,
on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive
officers in connection with the mergers. It is important that Convergys shareholders vote their shares on each of these
matters, regardless of the number of shares owned.

SYNNEX is holding a special meeting of stockholders, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
SYNNEX special meeting, in order to obtain the stockholder approval necessary to approve the stock issuance. The stock
issuance requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the SYNNEX special meeting. SYNNEX
stockholders will also be asked to approve the adjournment of the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit additional
proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the stock issuance at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting, or any
adjournment or postponement thereof. It is important that SYNNEX stockholders vote their shares on each of these
matters, regardless of the number of shares owned.

This document is being delivered to you as both a joint proxy statement of Convergys and SYNNEX and a prospectus of
SYNNEX in connection with the mergers. It is the proxy statement by which Convergys’ board of directors is soliciting
proxies from Convergys shareholders to vote at the Convergys special meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement of the
Convergys special meeting, on the adoption of the merger agreement, the approval of the adjournment of the Convergys special
meeting under certain circumstances and the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of compensation that will or may be

TABLE OF CONTENTS

paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers. It is also the proxy statement by
which SYNNEX’ board of directors is soliciting proxies from SYNNEX stockholders to vote at the SYNNEX special meeting,
or at any adjournment or postponement of the SYNNEX special meeting, on the approval of the stock issuance and the
approval of the adjournment of the SYNNEX special meeting under certain circumstances. In addition, this document is the
prospectus of SYNNEX pursuant to which SYNNEX will issue SYNNEX common stock to Convergys shareholders as part of
the merger consideration.

Q: Is my vote important?

A: Yes, your vote is very important. For Convergys shareholders, an abstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the adoption of the merger agreement. If you hold your Convergys common shares through a broker, bank or
other nominee holder of record and you do not give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record,
that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record will not be able to vote your shares on the adoption of the merger
agreement, and your failure to give those instructions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the adoption of the
merger agreement. For SYNNEX stockholders, an abstention will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the approval of
the stock issuance. If you hold your SYNNEX common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record and
you do not give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, that broker, bank or other nominee
holder of record will not be able to vote your shares on the approval of the stock issuance, and your failure to give those
instructions will have no effect on the approval of the stock issuance. Convergys’ board of directors unanimously recommends
that you vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement, and SYNNEX’ board of directors unanimously recommends that
SYNNEX stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the stock issuance.

Q: What will happen in the mergers?

A: In the first merger, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the initial merger, Merger Sub I will be
merged with and into Convergys. Convergys will be the surviving corporation in the initial merger and will be a wholly owned
subsidiary of SYNNEX following the completion of the initial merger and will no longer be a publicly held corporation.
Immediately after the initial merger, Convergys will be merged with and into Merger Sub II, and Merger Sub II will be the
surviving company in the second merger, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the subsequent merger.
The initial merger and the subsequent merger are collectively referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
mergers. Concentrix CVG Corporation will be a wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX following the completion of the
subsequent merger.

Q: What will Convergys shareholders receive in the mergers?

A: If the mergers are completed, each Convergys common share will be automatically cancelled and converted into the right to
receive $13.25 in cash, without interest, and 0.1193 shares of SYNNEX common stock, subject to adjustment as provided in
the merger agreement in the event that the 20 day average trading price of SYNNEX common stock prior to the closing of the
mergers increases or decreases by more than 10% from a base price of $111.0766, which, together with cash payable in lieu of
any fractional shares, are collectively referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the merger consideration. Each
Convergys shareholder will receive cash for any fractional share of SYNNEX common stock that the shareholder would
otherwise receive in the mergers.

Based on the closing price of SYNNEX common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, which is referred to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as the NYSE, on August 23, 2018, the most recent trading day prior to the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus for which this information was available, and assuming that such price was the stock price required by the
exchange ratio calculations, the applicable exchange ratio would be 0.1237, and the merger consideration would represent
approximately $25.18 in value for each Convergys common share. Because the number of shares of SYNNEX common stock
that will be exchanged for the Convergys common shares is subject to certain adjustments to be made at closing if the 20 day
average trading price of SYNNEX common stock three trading days prior to the closing of the mergers has increased or
decreased by more than 10% from a base price of $111.0766, the value of the stock portion of the merger consideration that
Convergys shareholders will receive in the mergers will

TABLE OF CONTENTS

depend on the market price of SYNNEX common stock at the time the mergers are completed. The market price of SYNNEX
common stock when Convergys shareholders receive shares of SYNNEX common stock after the mergers are completed could
be greater than, less than or the same as the market price of SYNNEX common stock on the date of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus or at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

Q: What will happen if the mergers are not completed?

A: If the merger agreement is not adopted by Convergys shareholders, the stock issuance is not approved by SYNNEX
stockholders or if the mergers are not completed for any other reason, Convergys shareholders will not receive any payment for
their Convergys common shares in connection with the mergers. Instead, Convergys will remain an independent public
company and its common shares will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE. If the merger agreement is terminated
under specified circumstances, Convergys may be required to pay SYNNEX a termination fee of $74.0 million (or $37.0
million, in certain circumstances) or an expense reimbursement fee of $12.35 million, and if the merger agreement is
terminated under certain other circumstances, SYNNEX may be required to pay Convergys an expense reimbursement fee of
$12.35 million, depending on the circumstances of the termination. See “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and
Expenses” for a more detailed discussion of the termination fees.

Q: What are Convergys shareholders being asked to vote on?

A: Convergys shareholders are being asked to vote on the following three proposals:

• to adopt the merger agreement, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus;

• to approve the adjournment from time to time of the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if
there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof; and

• to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the payments that will or may be paid by Convergys to its named
executive officers in connection with the mergers.

The adoption of the merger agreement by Convergys shareholders is a condition to the obligations of Convergys and SYNNEX
to complete the mergers. Neither the approval of the adjournment proposal nor the approval of the non-binding advisory
proposal to approve compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in
connection with the mergers is a condition to the obligations of Convergys or SYNNEX to complete the mergers.

Q: What are SYNNEX stockholders being asked to vote on?

A: SYNNEX stockholders are being asked to vote on the following proposals:

• to approve the stock issuance; and

• to approve the adjournment of the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes to approve the stock issuance at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting, or any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

The approval of the stock issuance by SYNNEX stockholders is a condition to the obligations of Convergys and SYNNEX to
complete the mergers. The approval of the proposal to adjourn the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary is not a condition to
the obligations of Convergys or SYNNEX to complete the mergers.

Q: Does Convergys’ board of directors recommend that Convergys shareholders adopt the merger agreement?

A: Yes. Convergys’ board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the mergers, and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Convergys shareholders and
unanimously recommends that Convergys shareholders vote “FOR” the

Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Convergys’ Reasons for the Mergers;
Recommendations of the Convergys Board of Directors that Convergys Shareholders Adopt the Merger Agreement.”

Q: Does Convergys’ board of directors recommend that shareholders approve the adjournment from time to time of the
Convergys special meeting if necessary?

A: Yes. Convergys’ board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adjourn from time to time
the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. See “Convergys Proposal
II: Adjournment of the Convergys Special Meeting.”

Q: What is the compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection
with the mergers and why am I being asked to vote on it?

A: The Securities and Exchange Commission, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the SEC, has adopted
rules that require Convergys to seek an advisory (non-binding) vote on compensation that is tied to or based on the completion
of the mergers and that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the
mergers. This proposal is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the non-binding advisory proposal to approve
compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the
mergers.

Q: Does Convergys’ board of directors recommend that Convergys shareholders approve the non-binding advisory proposal to
approve compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with
the mergers?

A: Yes. Convergys’ board of directors unanimously recommends that Convergys shareholders vote “FOR” the proposal to
approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named
executive officers in connection with the mergers. See “Convergys Proposal III: Advisory Vote On Merger-Related Executive
Compensation Arrangements.”

Q: What happens if the non-binding advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may be paid or provided by
Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers is not approved?

A: Approval, on an advisory (non-binding basis), of compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named
executive officers in connection with the mergers is not a condition to completion of the mergers. The vote is an advisory vote
and is not binding. If the mergers are completed, Convergys may pay “compensation in connection with the mergers” to its
named executive officers even if Convergys shareholders fail to approve the non-binding advisory proposal to approve
compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the
mergers.

Q: Does SYNNEX’ board of directors recommend that SYNNEX stockholders approve the stock issuance?

A: Yes. SYNNEX’ board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the stock issuance, are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of
SYNNEX stockholders and unanimously recommends that SYNNEX stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the stock
issuance at the SYNNEX special meeting. See “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and SYNNEX
Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—SYNNEX’ Reasons for the Merger; Recommendations of SYNNEX’ Board of
Directors that the SYNNEX stockholders Approve the Stock Issuance.”

Q: Does SYNNEX’ board of directors recommend that SYNNEX stockholders approve the adjournment of the SYNNEX
special meeting if necessary?

A: Yes. SYNNEX’ board of directors unanimously recommends that SYNNEX stockholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adjourn
the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the stock
issuance at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof. See “SYNNEX Proposal
II: Adjournment of the SYNNEX Special Meeting.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What Convergys shareholder vote is required for the approval of each proposal?

A: The following are the voting requirements for the proposals at the Convergys special meeting:

• Adoption of the Merger Agreement: The affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Convergys
common shares entitled to vote on the proposal. Accordingly, a Convergys shareholder’s abstention from voting, the
failure of a Convergys shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee
holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record or a Convergys
shareholder’s other failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal.

• Adjournment (if necessary): The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the Convergys common shares
present or represented by proxy at the Convergys special meeting (whether or not a quorum is present). Accordingly, a
Convergys shareholder’s abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal, but the
failure of a Convergys shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee
holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record or a Convergys
shareholder’s other failure to vote will have no effect on the approval of the proposal.

• Approval of the Advisory Vote on Merger-Related Executive Compensation Arrangements: The affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority of the Convergys common shares present or represented by proxy at the Convergys special
meeting. Accordingly, a Convergys shareholder’s abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
the proposal, but the failure of a Convergys shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker,
bank or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record
or a Convergys shareholder’s other failure to vote will have no effect on the approval of the proposal.

Q: What SYNNEX stockholder vote is required for the approval of each proposal at the SYNNEX special meeting?

A: The following are the vote requirements for the proposals at the SYNNEX special meeting:

• Stock Issuance: Assuming a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the SYNNEX special
meeting is required. Accordingly, a SYNNEX stockholder’s abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal, but the failure of a SYNNEX stockholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through
a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of
record or a SYNNEX stockholder’s other failure to vote will have no effect on the approval of the proposal.

• Adjournment (if necessary): The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present at the SYNNEX special meeting in
person or by proxy and entitled to vote is required. Accordingly, a SYNNEX stockholder’s abstention from voting will
have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal, but the failure of a SYNNEX stockholder who holds his or her
shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker,
bank or other nominee holder of record or a SYNNEX stockholder’s other failure to vote will have no effect on the
approval of the proposal.

Q: What constitutes a quorum for the Convergys special meeting?

A: The presence at the Convergys special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of record of a majority of the Convergys
common shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote constitutes a quorum for the Convergys special meeting.
Abstentions will be deemed present at the Convergys special meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.
Convergys common shares held in “street name” with respect to which the beneficial owner fails to give voting instructions to
the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record will not be deemed present at the Convergys special meeting for the purpose
of determining the presence of a quorum.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: What constitutes a quorum for the SYNNEX special meeting?

A: A quorum, which is a majority of the outstanding shares as of the record date, must be present to vote on certain matters at the
SYNNEX special meeting. A quorum is calculated based on the number of shares represented by the stockholders attending in
person and by their proxy holders. If you indicate an abstention as your voting preference, your shares will be counted toward a
quorum but they will not be voted on the matter.

Abstentions on any matters are treated as shares present or represented and entitled to vote on that matter and have the same
effect as a vote against such matter.

Shares of SYNNEX common stock held in “street name” with respect to which the beneficial owner fails to give voting
instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record will not be deemed present at the SYNNEX special meeting
for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.

Q: Who is entitled to vote at the Convergys special meeting?

A: All holders of Convergys common shares who held shares at the record date for the Convergys special meeting (the close of
business on August 31, 2018) are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Convergys special meeting. As of the close of
business on August 23, the most recent practicable date for which such information was available, there were 91,155,277
Convergys common shares outstanding. Each holder of Convergys common shares is entitled to one vote for each Convergys
common share owned at such record date.

Q: Who is entitled to vote at the SYNNEX special meeting?

A: All holders of SYNNEX common stock who held shares at the record date for the SYNNEX special meeting (the close of
business on August 31, 2018) are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the SYNNEX special meeting. As of the close of
business on August 23, 2018, the most recent practicable date for which such information was available, there were 39,628,172
SYNNEX common stock outstanding. Each holder of SYNNEX common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of
SYNNEX common stock owned at such record date.

Q: What if I hold shares in both Convergys and SYNNEX?

A: If you are both a Convergys shareholder and a SYNNEX stockholder, you will receive separate packages of proxy materials
from each company. A vote as a Convergys shareholder for the adoption of the merger agreement (or any other proposal to be
considered at the Convergys special meeting) will not constitute a vote as a SYNNEX stockholder to approve the stock
issuance (or any other proposal to be considered at the SYNNEX special meeting), and vice versa. Therefore, please complete,
sign and date and return all proxy cards and/or voting instructions that you receive from Convergys or SYNNEX, or submit
your proxy or instructions for each set of voting materials over the Internet or by telephone in order to ensure that all of your
shares are voted.

Q: When and where is the Convergys special meeting?

A: The Convergys special meeting will be held on October 3, 2018, at the Atrium One Building, 201 East Fourth Street, Suite 350,
Cincinnati, Ohio 45202, at 1:00 p.m. (local time).

duplicate voting). Proxies may be submitted via the Internet or by telephone 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and must be
received by 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on October 2, 2018.

If you hold Convergys common shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, you may
provide voting instructions via the Internet or by telephone only if Internet or telephone voting is made available by your
broker, bank or other nominee holder of record. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or other
nominee holder of record with these materials.

By Mail

If you hold Convergys common shares directly in your name as a shareholder of record, you may submit a proxy card to vote
by mail. You will need to complete, sign and date your proxy card and return it using the postage-paid return envelope
provided or return it to Broadridge. Broadridge must receive your proxy card no later than the close of business on October 2,
2018.

If you hold Convergys common shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, in order to
provide voting instructions by mail, you will need to complete, sign and date the voting instruction form provided by your
broker, bank or other nominee holder of record and return it in the postage-paid return envelope provided. Your broker, bank or
other nominee holder of record must receive your voting instruction form in sufficient time to vote your shares.

In Person

If you hold Convergys common shares directly in your name as a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the
Convergys special meeting. Shareholders of record also may be represented by another person at the Convergys special
meeting by executing a proper proxy designating that person.

If you hold Convergys common shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, you must
obtain a written legal proxy from that institution and present it to the inspector of elections with your ballot to be able to vote in
person at the Convergys special meeting. To request a legal proxy, please contact your broker, bank or other nominee holder of
record.

Please carefully consider the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Whether or not you plan
to attend the Convergys special meeting, Convergys encourages you to submit a proxy to vote via the Internet, by
telephone or by mail so that your shares will be voted in accordance with your wishes even if you later decide not to
attend the Convergys special meeting.

Convergys encourages you to submit your proxy to vote via the Internet, by telephone or by mail. If you attend the Convergys
special meeting, you may also vote in person, in which case any proxies that you previously submitted—whether via the
Internet, by telephone or by mail—will be revoked and superseded by the vote that you cast at the Convergys special meeting.
To vote in person at the Convergys special meeting, beneficial owners who hold shares in “street name” through a broker, bank
or other nominee holder of record will need to contact the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to obtain a written
legal proxy to bring to the meeting. Whether your proxy is submitted via the Internet, by telephone or by mail, if it is properly
completed and submitted, and if you do not revoke it prior to or at the Convergys special meeting, your shares will be voted at
the Convergys special meeting in the manner specified by you, except as otherwise set forth in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Again, you may submit a proxy to vote via the Internet or by telephone until 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on October 2,
2018, or Broadridge must receive your proxy card by mail no later than the close of business on October 2, 2018.

Q: If my Convergys common shares are held in “street name,” will my broker, bank or other nominee holder of record
automatically vote my shares for me?

A: No. If your shares are held in an account at a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record (i.e., in “street name”), you must
instruct the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record on how to vote your shares. Your broker, bank or other nominee
holder of record will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by filling out the voting instruction form
sent to you by your broker, bank or other nominee

holder of record with this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record who hold
Convergys common shares in “street name” typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on “routine” proposals when
they have not received instructions on how to vote from the beneficial owner. However, brokers, banks and other nominee
holders of record are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion on matters that are “non-routine” without specific
instructions on how to vote from the beneficial owner. Under the current rules of the NYSE, each of the three proposals to be
considered at the Convergys special meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is considered non-routine.
Therefore brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record do not have discretionary authority to vote on any of the three
proposals.

Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record that are present in person or represented
by proxy at the Convergys special meeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record is not
instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares on how to vote on a particular proposal and the broker does not have
discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record do not have
discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals to be considered at the Convergys special meeting as
described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, if a beneficial owner of Convergys common shares held in “street name”
does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, then those shares will not be present in
person or represented by proxy at the Convergys special meeting. As a result, there will not be any broker non-votes in
connection with any of the three proposals to be considered at the Convergys special meeting as described in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Q: How will my shares be represented at the Convergys special meeting?

A: If you correctly submit your proxy via the Internet, by telephone or by mail, the directors of Convergys named in your proxy
card will vote your shares in the manner you requested. If you sign your proxy card and return it without indicating how you
would like to vote your shares, your proxy will be voted as Convergys’ board of directors unanimously recommends, which is:

• “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement;

• “FOR” the approval of the adjournment from time to time of the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit
additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the Convergys special
meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof; and

• “FOR” the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of compensation that will or may be paid or provided by
Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers.

However, if you indicate that you wish to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement, your shares will only be voted in
favor of the adjournment proposal if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of that proposal.

Q: How do I vote my shares at the SYNNEX special meeting?

A: Via the Internet or by Telephone

If you hold SYNNEX common stock directly in your name as a stockholder of record, you may vote via the Internet at
www.AALvote.com/SNXSM or by telephone by calling 1 (866) 804-9616 toll-free. In order to submit a proxy to vote via the
Internet or by telephone, you will need the control number on your proxy card (which is unique to each SYNNEX stockholder

Please carefully consider the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Whether or not you plan
to attend the SYNNEX special meeting, SYNNEX encourages you to vote via the Internet, by telephone or by mail so

telephone or by mail—will be revoked and superseded by the vote that you cast at the SYNNEX special meeting. To vote in
person at the SYNNEX special meeting, beneficial owners who hold shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other
nominee holder of record will need to contact the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to obtain a written legal proxy
to bring to the meeting. Whether your proxy is submitted via the Internet, by phone or by mail, if it is properly completed and

Q: If my SYNNEX common stock are held in “street name,” will my broker, bank or other nominee holder of record

A: No. If your shares are held in an account at a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record (i.e., in “street name”), you must

or other nominee holder of record is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares on how to vote on a particular proposal
and the broker does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers, banks and other nominee holders of
record do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to either of the proposals to be considered at the SYNNEX special
meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, if a beneficial owner of SYNNEX common stock held in “street
name” does not give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, then those shares will not be present
in person or represented by proxy at the SYNNEX special meeting. As a result, there will not be any broker non-votes in connection
with either of the proposals to be considered at the SYNNEX special meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Q: How will my shares be represented at the SYNNEX special meeting?

A: If you correctly submit your proxy via the Internet, by telephone or by mail, the persons named in your proxy card will vote
your shares in the manner you requested. If you sign your proxy card and return it without indicating how you would like to
vote your shares, your proxy will be voted as SYNNEX’ board of directors unanimously recommends, which is:

• “FOR” the stock issuance; and

• “FOR” the approval of the adjournment of the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there
are not sufficient votes to approve the stock issuance at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting.

However, if you indicate that you wish to vote against the approval of the stock issuance, your shares will only be voted in
favor of the adjournment proposal if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of that proposal.

Q: Who may attend the Convergys special meeting?

A: Convergys shareholders at the record date for the Convergys special meeting (the close of business on August 31, 2018), or
their respective authorized representatives, may attend the Convergys special meeting. If you hold Convergys common shares
in your name at the record date, please be prepared to provide valid government-issued photo identification (e.g., a driver’s

If you are a beneficial owner of Convergys common shares held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee holder of
record at the record date (the close of business on August 31, 2018), in addition to proper identification, you will also need
proof of beneficial ownership at the record date to be admitted to the Convergys special meeting. A brokerage statement or
letter from a bank, broker or other nominee holder of record are examples of proof of beneficial ownership. If you want to vote
your Convergys common shares held in “street name” in person at the Convergys special meeting, you will have to obtain a
written legal proxy in your name from the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record who holds your shares.

• if you are a SYNNEX stockholder, to Alliance Advisors at 200 Broadacres Drive, 3rd Fl., Bloomfield, NJ 07003.

in each case, that bears a date later than the date of the proxy you want to revoke and is received prior to the applicable special
meeting;

• submitting a valid, later-dated proxy via the Internet or by telephone before 11:59 p.m. (local time) on October 2, 2018, or
by mail that is received prior to the applicable special meeting; or

• attending the applicable special meeting (or, if the applicable special meeting is adjourned or postponed, attending the
adjourned or postponed meeting) and voting in person, which automatically will cancel any proxy previously given, or
revoking your proxy in person, but your attendance alone will not revoke any proxy previously given.

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, you must contact your
brokerage firm, bank or other nominee holder of record to change your vote or obtain a written legal proxy to vote your shares
if you wish to cast your vote in person at the applicable special meeting.

Q: What happens if I sell my Convergys common shares after the record date but before the Convergys special meeting?

A: The record date for the Convergys special meeting (the close of business on August 31, 2018) is earlier than the date of the
Convergys special meeting and earlier than the date that the mergers are expected to be completed. If you sell or otherwise
transfer your Convergys common shares after the record date but before the date of the Convergys special meeting, you will
retain your right to vote at the Convergys special meeting. However, you will not have the right to receive the merger
consideration. In order to receive the merger consideration, you must hold your shares through completion of the mergers.

Q: What happens if I sell my SYNNEX shares after the record date but before the SYNNEX special meeting?

A: The record date for the SYNNEX special meeting (the close of business on August 31, 2018) is earlier than the date of the
SYNNEX special meeting. If you sell or otherwise transfer your shares of SYNNEX common stock after the record date but
before the date of the SYNNEX special meeting, you will retain your right to vote at the SYNNEX special meeting.

Q: What do I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the
related proxy card or the voting instruction forms. This can occur if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account,
if you hold shares directly as a record holder and also in “street name,” or otherwise through another nominee holder of record,
and in certain other circumstances. In addition, if you are a holder of shares of both Convergys common shares and SYNNEX
common stock, you will receive one or more separate proxy cards or voting instruction cards for each company. If you receive
more than one set of voting materials, please separately submit votes for each set of voting materials in order to ensure that all
of your shares are voted.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Q: Are Convergys shareholders or SYNNEX stockholders entitled to appraisal rights?

A: Convergys shareholders: Yes. Convergys shareholders are entitled to dissenters’ rights in connection with the initial merger.
For further information, see “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of
the Stock Issuance—Appraisal Rights for Convergys Shareholders.”

SYNNEX stockholders: No. SYNNEX stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal or dissenters’ rights in connection with the
mergers.

Q: Is completion of the mergers subject to any conditions?

A: Yes. SYNNEX and Convergys are not required to complete the mergers unless a number of conditions are satisfied (or, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, waived). These conditions include the adoption of the merger agreement by Convergys
shareholders, the approval of the stock issuance by SYNNEX stockholders, termination or expiration of the waiting period
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the HSR Act (early termination was granted, effective on July 30, 2018), and the receipt of certain
other regulatory approvals. For a more complete summary of the conditions that must be satisfied (or, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, waived) prior to completion of the mergers, see “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the
Mergers.”

Q: When do you expect to complete the mergers?

A: As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Convergys and SYNNEX expect to complete the mergers by the end of
calendar year 2018, subject to adoption of the merger agreement by Convergys shareholders, the approval of the stock issuance
by SYNNEX stockholders, the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction (or waiver, to the extent permitted by
applicable law) of the other conditions that must be satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waived) prior to
completion of the mergers. However, no assurance can be given as to when, or if, the mergers will be completed.

Q: What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transaction to Convergys shareholders?

A: Although SYNNEX and Convergys have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to cause the initial merger, together with the
subsequent merger, to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (referred to in this joint proxy statement as the Code), which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the intended tax treatment, there can be no assurance that the mergers will so qualify. In addition, the
completion of the mergers is not conditioned on the mergers qualifying for the intended tax treatment or upon the receipt of an
opinion of counsel or Internal Revenue Service, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the IRS, ruling
to that effect, and whether or not the mergers will qualify for the intended tax treatment depends on facts that will not be known
until the mergers are completed. In particular, the intended tax treatment requires that the value of the shares of SYNNEX
common stock issued to Convergys shareholders in the initial merger, determined as of the completion of the initial merger,
represents at least a minimum percentage of the total consideration paid to Convergys shareholders in the mergers. While there
is no specific guidance as to precisely what minimum percentage is necessary to satisfy this requirement, it would be satisfied
if the shares of SYNNEX common stock (valued as of the completion of the initial merger) represents at least 40% of the total
merger consideration. Because this test is based on the value of the shares of SYNNEX common stock as of the completion of
the initial merger, a decline in the value of the shares of SYNNEX common stock could cause this requirement not to be met.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the mergers will qualify for the intended tax treatment.

If the mergers qualify for the intended tax treatment, as further described under “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger
Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences,” a
U.S. holder of Convergys common shares generally will not recognize any loss and generally will recognize gain (if any) in an
amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount by which the sum of the fair market value of the shares of SYNNEX common
stock and cash received by such holder exceeds such holder’s tax basis in its Convergys common shares and (ii) the amount of
cash received by such holder. If the mergers fail to qualify for the intended tax treatment, as

TABLE OF CONTENTS

further described under “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the
Stock Issuance—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences,” a U.S. holder of Convergys common shares generally will
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the sum of the fair market value of the shares of
SYNNEX common stock and the amount of cash received by such holder (including cash received in lieu of a fractional share
of SYNNEX common stock) and (2) such holder’s tax basis in the Convergys common shares surrendered.

Each Convergys shareholder is urged to read the section “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and
SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” and to consult its tax
advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income or other tax consequences to it of the
mergers.

Q: What do I need to do now?

A: Carefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus, including its annexes. Then, please vote your Convergys common shares or SYNNEX common stock, as
applicable, which you may do by:

• completing, dating, signing and returning the enclosed proxy card for the applicable company in the accompanying
postage-paid return envelope;

• submitting your proxy via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions included on your proxy card for such
company; or

• attending the applicable special meeting and voting by ballot in person.

If you hold shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, please instruct your broker, bank
or other nominee holder of record to vote your shares by following the instructions that the broker, bank or other nominee
holder of record provides to you with these materials.

See “—How will my shares be represented at the Convergys special meeting?” or “—How will my shares be represented at the
SYNNEX special meeting?”, as applicable.

Q: Should I send in my Convergys share certificates now?

A: No. Convergys shareholders should not send in their share certificates at this time. After completion of the mergers, SYNNEX’
exchange agent will send you a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging your Convergys common shares for the
merger consideration. The SYNNEX common stock you receive in the initial merger will be issued in book-entry form and
physical certificates will not be issued. See “The Merger Agreement—Procedures for Surrendering Convergys Certificates.”
SYNNEX stockholders will keep their existing stock certificates, if any, and will not be required to take any action with respect
to their certificates.

Q: As a holder of options issued by Convergys to purchase Convergys common shares, or a holder of Convergys restricted
stock units, performance-based restricted stock units or deferred stock units, what will I receive in the mergers?

A: The treatment of an option to purchase Convergys common shares depends on whether on or not the option has an exercise
price which is higher than the “cash equivalent merger consideration.” The cash equivalent merger consideration is the sum of
(A) $13.25 plus (B) the product of the number of shares of SYNNEX common stock equal to the exchange ratio, multiplied by
the volume weighted average price per share (calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of one cent) of SYNNEX common stock
on the NYSE, for the consecutive period of 20 trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the
completion of the initial merger, as calculated by Bloomberg Financial LP under the function “VWAP,” which price per share is
referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the SYNNEX closing price. Each option to purchase Convergys common
shares that is outstanding as of the completion of the initial merger: (i) that has an exercise price per Convergys common share
that is less than the cash equivalent merger consideration, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash
amount equal to, for each Convergys common share underlying such Convergys option, the excess of (x) cash equivalent
merger consideration over (y) the applicable per share exercise price of the Convergys option and (ii) that has an exercise price
per Convergys common share that is greater than or equal to the cash equivalent merger consideration, will be cancelled for no
consideration.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Immediately prior to the completion of the initial merger, each outstanding Convergys restricted stock unit, which is referred to
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as a Convergys RSU, each Convergys performance-based restricted stock unit, which
is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as a Convergys PSU, and each outstanding Convergys deferred stock unit,
which is referred to in this joint proxy statements/prospectus as a Convergys DSU, will be cancelled in consideration for the
right to receive a cash payment, with respect to each Convergys common share underlying such Convergys RSU, Convergys
PSU, or Convergys DSU, equal to the cash equivalent merger consideration, or, if higher, a cash amount equal to the average of
the opening and closing prices of the Convergys common shares on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date.
The payment for Convergys PSUs will be based on the greater of the number of shares that would be earned based on
achievement of target performance or the applicable number of shares determined under the applicable award agreement as
determined by Convergys’ board of directors. The cash payment in respect of each Convergys RSU or Convergys PSU that was
granted on or after March 31, 2016 (other than any such Convergys RSU or Convergys PSU that is held by a non-employee
director or that becomes vested at the completion of the initial merger pursuant to the terms of an applicable contract) will
remain unvested as of the completion of the initial merger and will continue to vest and be paid in accordance with the terms of
the applicable award agreement. Other than as provided above, and except in the case of certain awards that constitute
nonqualified deferred compensation for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the cash payments will be paid promptly
following the completion of the initial merger, but not later than five business days following such date.

See “The Merger Agreement—Treatment of Convergys Equity Awards.”

Q: If I am a Convergys shareholder, whom should I call with questions?

A: If you are a Convergys shareholder and have any questions about the merger agreement, the mergers, the vote on the merger
agreement, the adjournment vote, the advisory (non-binding) vote on compensation that will or may be paid or provided by
Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers or the Convergys special meeting, or this joint proxy

Special Meeting of Shareholders of Convergys (See Page 70)

Meeting. The Convergys special meeting will be held on October 3, 2018, at the Atrium One Building, 201 East Fourth
Street, Suite 350, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202, at 1:00 p.m. (local time). At the Convergys special meeting, Convergys shareholders
will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:

• to adopt the merger agreement;

• to approve the adjournment from time to time of the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies
if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any
postponement or adjournment thereof; and

• to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its
named executive officers in connection with the mergers.

Record Date. Convergys’ board of directors has fixed the close of business on August 31, 2018, as the record date for
determination of the shareholders entitled to vote at the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.
Only Convergys shareholders of record at the record date are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Convergys special
meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the Convergys special meeting. As of the close of business on August 23, 2018,
the most recent practicable date for which such information was available, there were 91,155,277 Convergys common shares
outstanding. The number of Convergys common shares outstanding as of the record date is not expected to be meaningfully
different from the number on August 23, 2018. Each holder of Convergys common shares is entitled to one vote for each
Convergys common share owned at the record date.

Quorum. The presence at the Convergys special meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of record of a majority of the
Convergys common shares issued and outstanding at the record date (the close of business on August 31, 2018) and entitled to
vote will be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum at the Convergys special meeting. Abstentions will be deemed
present at the Convergys special meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. Convergys common shares
held in “street name” with respect to which the beneficial owner fails to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other
nominee holder of record on any of the proposals to be voted on at the Convergys special meeting, and Convergys common
shares with

TABLE OF CONTENTS

respect to which the beneficial owner otherwise fails to vote, will not be deemed present at the Convergys special meeting for the
purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the Convergys special
meeting. Failure of a quorum to be present at the Convergys special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement
thereof and will subject Convergys to additional expense.

Required Vote. Pursuant to the Ohio General Corporation law, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus
as the OGCL, the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the Convergys common shares outstanding and entitled to
vote thereon is required to adopt the merger agreement. Convergys cannot complete the mergers and the merger
consideration will not be paid unless its shareholders adopt the merger agreement by a vote “FOR” the proposal by
holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Convergys common shares entitled to vote on the proposal. Because
adoption of the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Convergys
common shares entitled to vote thereon, a Convergys shareholder’s abstention from voting, the failure of a Convergys
shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to
give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record or a Convergys shareholder’s other failure
to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

To approve (i) the adjournment from time to time of the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies
if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof and (ii) the non-binding advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may be paid by Convergys
to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of
the Convergys common shares present or represented by proxy at the Convergys special meeting. Accordingly, a Convergys
shareholder’s abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” such proposals, but the failure of a
Convergys shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to
give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other holder of record or a Convergys shareholder’s other failure to vote will have
no effect on the outcome of any vote on such proposals.

Share Ownership of and Voting by Convergys Directors and Certain Executive Officers. At the close of business on
August 23, 2018, the most recent practicable date for which such information was available, Convergys’ directors and chief
executive officer and chief financial officer and their affiliates beneficially owned and had the right to vote in the aggregate
1,082,104 Convergys common shares, which represents approximately 1.2% of the Convergys common shares entitled to vote as
of that date.

Each of the directors and certain executive officers of Convergys, solely in his or her individual capacity as a Convergys
shareholder, has entered into a voting agreement with SYNNEX, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as
the voting agreement, to vote all of the Convergys common shares eligible to be voted at the Convergys special meeting by them
in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and in favor of the proposal to adjourn the Convergys special meeting if
necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the Convergys
special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

Special Meeting of Stockholders of SYNNEX (See Page 65)

Meeting. The SYNNEX special meeting will be held on October 3, 2018, at its offices at 44201 Nobel Drive, Fremont,
California 94538, at 10:00 a.m. (Pacific Time). At the SYNNEX special meeting, SYNNEX stockholders will be asked to
consider and vote on the following proposals:

TABLE OF CONTENTS

of the close of business on August 23, 2018, there were 39,628,172 shares of SYNNEX common stock outstanding. The number
of shares of SYNNEX common stock outstanding as of the record date is not expected to be meaningfully different from the
number on August 23, 2018. Each holder of SYNNEX common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of SYNNEX common
stock owned at the record date.

Quorum. A quorum, which is a majority of the outstanding shares as of the record date, must be present to hold the
SYNNEX special meeting. A quorum is calculated based on the number of shares represented by the stockholders attending in
person and by their proxy holders. If you indicate an abstention as your voting preference, your shares will be counted toward a
quorum but they will not be voted on the matter. Abstentions on any matters are treated as shares present or represented and
entitled to vote on that matter and have the same effect as a vote against such matter. Shares of SYNNEX common stock held in
“street name” with respect to which the beneficial owner fails to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee
holder of record on any of the proposals to be voted on at the SYNNEX special meeting, and shares of SYNNEX common stock
with respect to which the beneficial owner otherwise fails to vote, will not be deemed present at the SYNNEX special meeting for
the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. There must be a quorum for the vote on the stock issuance to be taken at
the SYNNEX special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be present at the SYNNEX special meeting will necessitate an adjournment
of the meeting and will subject SYNNEX to additional expense.

Required Vote. Assuming a quorum is present, approval of the stock issuance requires the affirmative vote of a majority of
the votes cast at the SYNNEX special meeting. SYNNEX cannot complete the mergers unless its stockholders approve the
stock issuance. Under the current rules and interpretive guidance of the NYSE, “votes cast” on the stock issuance consist of
votes “for” or “against” as well as abstentions. As a result, a SYNNEX stockholder’s abstention from voting on the stock
issuance will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal. The failure of a SYNNEX stockholder who holds his or
her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker,
bank or other nomineeholder of record or a SYNNEX stockholder’s other failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of
any vote to approve the stock issuance because these failures to vote are not considered “votes cast.”

To approve the adjournment of the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes to approve the stock issuance at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting, whether or not a quorum, as defined
under Delaware law, is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present at the SYNNEX special meeting in person
or by proxy and entitled to vote is required. Accordingly, a SYNNEX stockholder’s abstention from voting will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal, but, the failure of a SYNNEX stockholder who holds his or her shares in “street name”
through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder
of record or a SYNNEX stockholder’s other failure to vote will have no effect on the approval of the proposal.

Stock Ownership of and Voting by SYNNEX Directors and Executive Officers. At the close of business on August 23,
2018, the most recent practicable date for which such information was available, SYNNEX’ directors and executive officers and
their affiliates beneficially owned and had the right to vote in the aggregate 9,787,431 shares of SYNNEX common stock, which
represents approximately 24.7% of the SYNNEX common stock entitled to vote as of that date. Assuming a quorum is present, to
approve the stock issuance, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the SYNNEX special meeting is required.

It is expected that SYNNEX’ directors and executive officers and their affiliates will vote their shares “FOR” the stock
issuance and “FOR” the adjournment of at the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes to approve the stock issuance at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, although none of them has entered into any agreement requiring them to do so.

What Convergys Shareholders Will Receive in the Mergers (See Page 132)

If the mergers are completed, each Convergys common share will automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive $13.25 in cash, without interest, and 0.1193 of shares of SYNNEX common stock, subject to adjustment as provided in
the merger agreement in the event that the trading price of SYNNEX common stock prior to the closing of the mergers increases
or decreases by more than 10% from a base price of $111.0766.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SYNNEX will not issue any fractional shares in the mergers. Instead, the total number of shares of SYNNEX common stock
that each Convergys shareholder will receive in the mergers will be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and each
Convergys shareholder will receive cash, without interest, for any fractional share of SYNNEX common stock that he or she
would otherwise receive in the mergers. The amount of cash for fractional shares will be calculated by multiplying the fraction of
a share of SYNNEX common stock that such Convergys shareholder would otherwise be entitled to receive in the mergers by the
SYNNEX closing price.

Example: If you own 100 Convergys common shares at the time the mergers are completed, and assuming no adjustment is
made to the exchange ratio, you will be entitled to receive $1,325 in cash, without interest, and 11 shares of SYNNEX common
stock. In addition, you will be entitled to receive an amount of cash equal to 0.93 of a share of SYNNEX common stock multiplied
by the SYNNEX closing price.

The exchange ratio is fixed for price fluctuations less than 10%, which means that it may not change between now and the
date of the initial merger, regardless of whether the market price of either SYNNEX common stock or Convergys common shares
changes. Therefore, the value of the stock portion of the merger consideration will depend on the market price of SYNNEX
common stock at the time Convergys shareholders receive SYNNEX common stock in the mergers. Based on the closing price of
a share of SYNNEX common stock on the NYSE on August 23, 2018, the most recent trading day prior to the date of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus for which this information was available, and assuming that such price was the stock price required
by the exchange ratio calculations, the applicable exchange ratio would be 0.1237, and the merger consideration would represent
approximately $25.18 in value for each Convergys common share. The market price of SYNNEX common stock has
fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the merger agreement and will continue to fluctuate from the date of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus to the date of the Convergys special meeting and the date the mergers are completed and
thereafter. The market price of SYNNEX common stock when received by Convergys shareholders after the mergers are
completed could be greater than, less than or the same as the market price of SYNNEX common stock on the date of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus or at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof.

Treatment of Convergys Equity Awards (See Page 134)

As of the completion of the initial merger, each option to purchase Convergys common shares, which are referred to in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus as Convergys options, that is outstanding as of the effective time of initial merger: (i) that has an
exercise price per Convergys common share that is less than the cash equivalent merger consideration, will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to, for each Convergys common share underlying such Convergys option,
the excess of (x) the cash equivalent merger consideration over (y) the applicable per share exercise price of the Convergys
option or (ii) that has an exercise price per Convergys common share that is greater than or equal to the cash equivalent merger
consideration, will be cancelled for no consideration.

Each Convergys RSU, Convergys PSU and Convergys DSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the
initial merger will be cancelled in consideration for the right to receive a cash payment with respect to each Convergys common
share underlying such Convergys RSU, Convergys PSU, or Convergys DSU, equal to the cash equivalent merger consideration,
or, if higher, a cash amount equal to the average of the opening and closing prices of the Convergys common shares on the
trading day immediately preceding the closing date. Payment for Convergys PSUs will be based on the greater of the number of
shares that would be earned based on achievement of target performance or the applicable number of shares determined under the
applicable award agreement as determined by Convergys’ board of directors. The cash payment in respect of each Convergys
RSU or Convergys PSU that was granted on or after March 31, 2016 (other than any such Convergys RSU or Convergys PSU
that is held by a non-employee director or that becomes vested at the completion of the initial merger pursuant to the terms of an
applicable contract) will remain unvested as of the completion of the initial merger and will continue to vest and be paid in
accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement. Other than as provided above, and except in the case of certain
awards that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, the cash payments will be
paid promptly following the completion of the initial merger, but not later than five business days following such date.

Recommendations of the Convergys Board of Directors (See Page 70)

Convergys’ board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the mergers, and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Convergys shareholders. Convergys’
board of directors unanimously recommends that Convergys shareholders vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement. For the factors considered by Convergys’ board of directors in reaching this decision, see “Convergys Proposal I:
Adoption of the Merger Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Convergys’ Reasons for the
Mergers; Recommendations of the Convergys Board of Directors that Convergys Shareholders Adopt the Merger Agreement.”

from time to time the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt
the merger agreement at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. See “Convergys
Proposal II: Adjournment of the Convergys Special Meeting.”

In addition, Convergys’ board of directors unanimously recommends that Convergys shareholders vote “FOR” the proposal
to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named
executive officers in connection with the mergers. See “Convergys Proposal III: Advisory Vote On Merger-Related Executive
Compensation Arrangements.”

Recommendations of the SYNNEX Board of Directors (See Page 65)

SYNNEX’ board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the mergers, and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the stock issuance, are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of
SYNNEX stockholders. SYNNEX’ board of directors unanimously recommends that SYNNEX stockholders vote “FOR”
the stock issuance. For the factors considered by SYNNEX’ board of directors in reaching this decision, see “Convergys
Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—SYNNEX’ Reasons
for the Merger; Recommendations of SYNNEX’ Board of Directors that SYNNEX Stockholders Approve the Stock Issuance.”

SYNNEX’ board of directors unanimously recommends that SYNNEX stockholders vote “FOR” the adjournment of the

at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof. See “SYNNEX Proposal II:
Adjournment of the SYNNEX Special Meeting.”

Opinion of Convergys’ Financial Advisor (See Page 92)

Convergys retained Centerview Partners LLC, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Centerview, as
financial advisor to Convergys’ board of directors in connection with the proposed mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, which are collectively referred to as the “Transaction” throughout this section and the
summary of Centerview’s opinion below under the caption “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and
SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance— Opinion of Convergys’ Financial Advisor.” In connection with this
engagement, Convergys’ board of directors requested that Centerview evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the
holders of Convergys common shares (other than Cancelled Shares, Converted Shares and Dissenting Shares (each as defined in
the merger agreement), and together with any other Convergys common shares held by any affiliate of Convergys or SYNNEX),
which are collectively referred to as “Excluded Shares” throughout this section and the summary of Centerview’s opinion below
under the caption “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the Stock
Issuance—Opinion of Convergys’ Financial Advisor” of the Consideration proposed to be paid to such holders pursuant to the
merger agreement. On June 28, 2018, Centerview rendered to Convergys’ board of directors its oral opinion, which was
subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated June 28, 2018 that, as of such date and based upon and subject to
the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by
Centerview in preparing its opinion, the Consideration proposed to be paid to the holders of Convergys common shares (other
than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For purposes of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the term “Consideration” means (i) a portion of a share of SYNNEX common stock equal
to the exchange ratio and (ii) $13.25 in cash, without interest, taken together and not separately.

Centerview’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date thereof, to the holders of
Convergys common shares (other than Excluded Shares) of the Consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the
merger agreement. Centerview’s opinion did not address any other term or aspect of the merger agreement or the
Transaction and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of Convergys or any other person as to how
such shareholder or other person should vote or otherwise act with respect to the Transaction or any other matter.

The full text of Centerview’s written opinion should be read carefully in its entirety for a description of the
assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review

Opinion of SYNNEX’ Financial Advisor (See Page 104)

In connection with the mergers, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as BofA Merrill Lynch, delivered to SYNNEX’ board of directors a written opinion, dated June 27, 2018, as
to the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, to SYNNEX, of the merger consideration to be
paid by SYNNEX in the mergers. The full text of the written opinion, dated June 27, 2018, of BofA Merrill Lynch, which
describes, among other things, the assumptions made, procedures followed, factors considered and limitations on the review
undertaken, is attached as Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
BofA Merrill Lynch provided its opinion to SYNNEX’ board of directors (in its capacity as such) for the benefit and use of
SYNNEX’ board of directors in connection with and for purposes of its evaluation of the merger consideration from a financial
point of view. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not address any other aspect of the mergers and no opinion or view was
expressed as to the relative merits of the mergers in comparison to other strategies or transactions that might be available to
SYNNEX or in which SYNNEX might engage or as to the underlying business decision of SYNNEX to proceed with or effect
the mergers. BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any SYNNEX stockholder or
Convergys shareholder should vote or act in connection with the proposed mergers or any related matter.

Ownership of SYNNEX Common Stock After the Mergers (See Page 114)

Based on the number of Convergys common shares outstanding as of August 23, 2018, the most recent practicable date for
which such information was available, SYNNEX expects to issue approximately 11,277,434 shares of SYNNEX common stock
to Convergys shareholders upon completion of the mergers and may issue up to approximately 801,000 shares of its common
stock upon conversion of Convergys’ outstanding convertible 5.75% junior subordinated convertible debentures due 2029, which
are referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the convertible debentures. The actual number of shares of SYNNEX
common stock to be issued and reserved for issuance upon completion of the mergers will be determined at the completion of the
mergers based on the exchange ratio and the number of Convergys common shares outstanding at that time. Based on the number
of Convergys common shares outstanding as of August 23, 2018, and the number of shares of SYNNEX common stock
outstanding as of August 23, 2018, the most recent practicable date for which such information was available, it is expected that,
immediately after completion of the mergers, former Convergys shareholders will own approximately 22% of the outstanding
SYNNEX common stock excluding the potential issuance of shares upon conversion of Convergys’ outstanding convertible
debentures.

Under the terms of the convertible debentures, the mergers will constitute a fundamental change and a make-whole
fundamental change. As a result, holders of the convertible debentures will be permitted to choose (i) to convert their convertible
debentures at a temporarily increased conversion rate, (ii) to require Convergys to buy back their convertible debentures for a
price equal to their principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest to but excluding the repurchase date, or (iii) to continue
holding their convertible debentures. If the closing of the mergers occurs, the holders of the convertible debentures are expected
to exercise the right to convert their debentures in accordance with their terms at a temporarily increased conversion rate shortly
following the closing

TABLE OF CONTENTS

of the mergers (although the holders’ actual decisions will depend upon their judgments based on the prevailing market
conditions). Upon conversion following the closing of the mergers, the convertible debentures would be convertible into either
cash or a combination of cash and shares of SYNNEX common stock, at the election of Merger Sub II, as successor to
Convergys, which would then be a subsidiary of SYNNEX. As of June 30, 2018, $125.0 million of aggregate principal amount of
the convertible debentures were outstanding.

Interests of Convergys’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers (See Page 159)

Convergys’ non-employee directors and executive officers may have interests in the mergers that are different from, or in
addition to, those of Convergys shareholders generally. These interests include, among others:

• Pursuant to the merger agreement, conversion of each outstanding and unvested Convergys RSU and Convergys PSU
award into a fixed cash amount, with vesting and payment to occur in certain cases promptly following the completion
of the initial merger, and with vesting and payment of cash award amounts that remain subject to service requirements
to occur upon the applicable award holder ceasing to be an employee of Convergys and its affiliates by reason of the
award holder’s death, disability, involuntary termination by Convergys without good cause, or resignation for good
reason, in each case prior to the applicable vesting date for such cash award amount;

• in the case of executive officers only, enhanced severance benefits upon a termination of employment without cause or
due to resignation for good reason, in each case, either in anticipation of and within six months prior to, or during the
two-year period immediately following, a change of control; and

• rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage under the terms of the merger agreement.

See “Interests of Convergys’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers” for a more detailed description of these
interests. Convergys’ board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in reaching its
decisions to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and to recommend that the shareholders of
Convergys approve the merger proposal.

Listing of SYNNEX Common Stock and Delisting and Deregistration of Convergys Common Shares (See Page 128)

SYNNEX will apply to have the shares of SYNNEX common stock to be issued in the initial merger approved for listing on
the NYSE, where SYNNEX common stock is currently traded. If the mergers are completed, Convergys common shares will no
longer be listed on the NYSE and will be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is referred
to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Exchange Act.

Dissenters’ Rights Available to Convergys Shareholders (See Page 123)

If the merger agreement is adopted by Convergys shareholders, Convergys shareholders who do not vote in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement and who properly demand payment of fair cash value of their shares are entitled to certain
dissenters’ rights pursuant to Sections 1701.84(A) and 1701.85 of the OGCL. Section 1701.85 generally provides that Convergys
shareholders will not be entitled to such rights without strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 1701.85, and
failure to take any one of the required steps may result in the termination or waiver of such rights.

Specifically, any Convergys shareholder who is a record holder of Convergys common shares on August 31, 2018, the
record date for the Convergys special meeting, and whose shares are not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement
may be entitled to be paid the “fair cash value” of such shares of common stock after the completion of the initial merger. To be
entitled to such payment, a shareholder must deliver to Convergys a written demand for payment of the fair cash value of the
shares held by such shareholder before the vote to adopt the merger agreement is taken, the shareholder must not vote in favor of
the adoption of the merger agreement, and the shareholder must otherwise comply with Section 1701.85. A Convergys
shareholder’s failure to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement will not constitute a waiver of such shareholder’s
dissenters’ rights, as long as such shareholder does not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. Any written
demand must specify the shareholder’s name and address, the number and class of shares held by him, her or it on the record
date, and the amount claimed as the “fair cash value” of such shares of common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

See the text of Sections 1701.84(A) and 1701.85 attached as Annex D to this joint proxy statement/prospectus for specific
information on the procedures to be followed in exercising dissenters’ rights. Convergys shareholders who wish to seek appraisal
of their shares are encouraged to seek the advice of legal counsel with respect to the exercise of dissenters’ rights, due to the
complexity of the appraisal process.

Convergys shareholders considering seeking payment of fair cash value of their shares should be aware that the “fair cash
value” of their shares as determined pursuant to Section 1701.85 of the OGCL could be more than, the same as, or less than the
value of the consideration they would receive pursuant to the merger if they did not seek payment of fair cash value of their
shares. If the Convergys common shares are listed on a national securities exchange, such as the NYSE, immediately before the
effective time of the initial merger, the fair cash value will be the closing sale price of Convergys’ common shares as of the close
of trading on the day before the vote of the Convergys common shareholders on the adoption of the merger agreement.

For a more complete description of Convergys shareholder’s appraisal rights, see “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the
Merger Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Appraisal Rights for Convergys Shareholders.”

Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights Not Available to SYNNEX Stockholders (See Page 124)

Under Delaware law, SYNNEX stockholders will not be entitled to appraisal or dissenters’ rights in connection with the
mergers.

Completion of the Mergers is Subject to Certain Conditions (See Page 135)

As more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreement, the obligation of each of
SYNNEX and the Merger Subs, on the one hand, and Convergys, on the other hand, to complete the mergers is subject to the
satisfaction (or waiver, to the extent permitted by applicable law) of a number of conditions, including the following:

• adoption of the merger agreement by holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Convergys common shares;

• approval of the stock issuance by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the SYNNEX special meeting;

• effectiveness of, and absence of any stop order with respect to, the registration statement on Form S-4, of which this
joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, and no proceeding to that effect has been commenced;

• absence of any injunction by any court having been entered or applicable law adopted that prohibits consummation of
the mergers;

• expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act (such early termination was granted,
effective on July 30, 2018) and the completion of all other required antitrust filings, notices, approvals and clearances;

• approval for the listing on the NYSE of the SYNNEX common stock to be issued in the initial merger;

• accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the merger agreement by the other party, subject to certain
materiality exceptions;

• performance and compliance in all material respects by the other party of the covenants required to be performed or
complied by it at or prior to completion of the initial merger; and

• the absence of a material adverse effect on the other party since the date of the merger agreement (see “The Merger
Agreement—Definition of ‘Material Adverse Effect”’ for the definition of material adverse effect).

SYNNEX and Convergys cannot be certain when, or if, the conditions to the mergers will be satisfied or waived, or that the
mergers will be completed.

The Mergers May Not Be Completed Without All Required Regulatory Approvals (See Page 148)

Completion of the mergers is conditioned upon the expiration or early termination of the waiting period relating to the
mergers under the HSR Act and completion of all other required antitrust filings, notices,

approvals and clearances, which are collectively referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the antitrust approvals.
Subsequent to such filings, Convergys and SYNNEX will respond to inquiries from governmental authorities, or provide any
supplemental information that may be requested by governmental authorities, in connection with filings made with such
governmental authorities.

Under the HSR Act, certain transactions, including the mergers, may not be completed unless the applicable waiting period
requirements have expired or been terminated. The HSR Act provides that each party must file a pre-merger notification with the
Federal Trade Commission, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the FTC, and the Antitrust Division of
the U.S. Department of Justice, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the DOJ. A transaction notifiable
under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the parties’ filings of
their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of that waiting period. If the DOJ or the FTC issues a
Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties
must observe a second 30-calendar-day waiting period, which would begin to run only after both parties have substantially
complied with the request for additional information, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier.

Each of SYNNEX and Convergys filed its required HSR Act notification and report with respect to the mergers on July 19,
2018, and the request for early termination under the HSR Act waiting period was granted effective on July 30, 2018. Both before
and after the termination of the waiting period, the FTC and Antitrust Division of the DOJ retain the authority to challenge the
mergers on antitrust grounds. In addition, the completion of the mergers is also conditioned upon obtaining consent,
authorization, expiration or termination of the merger control waiting period under certain foreign antitrust laws. SYNNEX, the
Merger Subs and Convergys have submitted and agreed to submit these merger control filings promptly following the submission
of their respective HSR Act filings.

In connection with the stock issuance, SYNNEX must file a registration statement on Form S-4, of which this joint proxy
statement/prospectus forms a part, with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the Securities Act, that is declared effective by the SEC. As a condition to the closing of the mergers, no
stop order shall be in effect with respect to the Form S-4, of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, and no
proceedings to that effect commenced.

Description of Debt Financing (See Page 128)

SYNNEX anticipates that the total amount of funds necessary to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration and to pay
transaction fees and expenses will be approximately $1,540 million, which amount is subject to adjustment as further described in
“The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration.” In addition, SYNNEX anticipates that the total amount of funds necessary to
directly or indirectly pay, repay, repurchase, or settle, as applicable, certain existing indebtedness of Convergys and its
subsidiaries will be approximately $500 million. These amounts will be funded through the takeout facility (defined below) and
cash on hand that SYNNEX may elect to apply in lieu of borrowing under the takeout facility. Remaining amounts under the
takeout facility will be used for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, permitted acquisitions or dividends.

To provide the debt financing required by SYNNEX to consummate the mergers, SYNNEX entered into:

(1) a commitment letter, dated June 28, 2018, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the bridge
commitment letter, from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &
Smith Incorporated, who are collectively referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus in such capacities as the
bridge commitment parties, pursuant to which SYNNEX received commitments for an aggregate principal amount of
$3.57 billion in financing to provide a senior secured 364-day term loan bridge facility, which is referred to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as the bridge facility. The bridge facility consisted of two different tranches of senior
secured term loans: the first tranche, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as tranche A of the
bridge facility, was for $1.8 billion in the aggregate; and the second tranche, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement as tranche B of the bridge facility, was for $1.77 billion in the aggregate. The incurrence of the acquisition-
related indebtedness which would be funded by tranche A of the bridge facility or the takeout facility was not permitted
under SYNNEX’ credit agreement dated as of November 27, 2013, among SYNNEX, the guarantors party thereto, the
lenders party

thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as agent, and which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
existing credit agreement. On August 7, 2018, SYNNEX obtained an amendment to the existing credit agreement in
order to permit such acquisition-related indebtedness, and pursuant to the terms of the bridge commitment letter, the
commitment with respect to tranche B of the bridge facility was automatically reduced to zero. On August 9, 2018,
SYNNEX entered into the takeout facility and pursuant to the terms of the bridge commitment letter, the commitment
with respect to tranche A of the bridge facility was automatically reduced to zero. As a result of the termination of both
tranche A of the bridge facility and tranche B of the bridge facility, there are no remaining financing commitments of
the lenders thereunder, and instead, the debt financing will be provided under the takeout facility; and

(2) a credit agreement dated August 9, 2018, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the takeout
facility, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, the guarantors party thereto, and the other lenders party thereto,
pursuant to which SYNNEX has received commitments for a $1.8 billion 5-year senior secured term loan A facility.
The term loan commitments under the takeout facility are subject to customary conditions. The borrower under the
takeout facility is SYNNEX and the secured obligations of SYNNEX under the takeout facility are and will be
guaranteed by each existing and subsequently acquired or formed direct and indirect domestic wholly-owned subsidiary
of SYNNEX, subject to customary exceptions.

The funding under the takeout facility is subject to customary conditions, including conditions that do not relate directly to
the conditions to closing in the merger agreement. See “The Merger Agreement—Financing.”

For a more complete description of SYNNEX’ debt financing for the mergers, see “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the
Merger Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Description of Debt Financing.”

SYNNEX and Convergys Expect the Mergers to be Completed by the End of Calendar Year 2018 (See Page 132)

The mergers will occur after the conditions to their completion have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, waived, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, SYNNEX
and Convergys expect the mergers to be completed by the end of the calendar year 2018. However, there can be no assurance as
to when, or if, the mergers will occur.

No Solicitation by Convergys (See Page 143)

As more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreement, and subject to the exceptions
described below and in the merger agreement, Convergys has agreed not to, among other things, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage or facilitate the submission of any proposal, or offer or inquiry regarding the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a takeover proposal (as hereinafter defined), (ii) engage in, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding or furnish to any third party any information in connection with
or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating an acquisition proposal from any third party or (iii) approve or enter into any
agreement or letter of intent with respect to an acquisition proposal by a third party.

However, at any time prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Convergys shareholders, if Convergys receives a
bona fide unsolicited written takeover proposal from a third party that (i) did not result from a breach of any of the non-solicit
provisions and (ii) Convergys’ board of directors determines in good faith that such takeover proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a superior acquisition proposal, as such term is defined under the caption “The Merger
Agreement—No Solicitation,” Convergys is permitted to:

• furnish, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with the third party that has made the takeover proposal, information
with respect to Convergys and its subsidiaries to the third party that has made the takeover proposal;

• engage in or otherwise participate in discussions and negotiations with the third party that has made such takeover
proposal.

Convergys’ board of directors may change, withdraw or modify its recommendation that Convergys shareholders adopt the
merger agreement and recommend a takeover proposal (or terminate the merger agreement

to enter into an agreement for such alternative transaction), if Convergys’ board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such takeover proposal constitutes a superior
proposal. Additionally, Convergys’ board of directors may also change, withdraw or modify its recommendation that Convergys
shareholders adopt the merger agreement if it determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that failure to change, withdraw or modify its recommendation would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties (whether or not as a result of a takeover proposal).

In addition, Convergys’ board of directors is not permitted to change, withdraw or modify its recommendation that
Convergys shareholders adopt the merger agreement or recommend a takeover proposal, unless, before taking that action,
Convergys gives SYNNEX two business days (four business days, in the event of a takeover proposal) prior written notice that it
intends to take that action and, and after considers in good faith any proposed revisions to the merger agreement proposed by
SYNNEX.

Termination of the Merger Agreement (See Page 153)

As more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreement, and on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the merger agreement may be terminated at any time before completion of the
mergers in any of the following ways:

• by mutual written consent of SYNNEX and Convergys; or

• by either SYNNEX or Convergys, if:

• the mergers have not been consummated on or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time), on December 28, 2018,
which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the end date, and which may be extended for a
period of 90 days by either party in order to obtain any regulatory approvals;

• a final and nonappealable order of any governmental authority that permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise
prohibits the consummation of the mergers has been issued;

• Convergys shareholders fail to adopt the merger agreement upon a vote taken on a proposal to adopt the merger
agreement at the Convergys special meeting;

• SYNNEX stockholders fail to approve the stock issuance upon a vote taken on a proposal to approve the stock
issuance at the SYNNEX special meeting; or

• there has been a breach of any representation or warranty or a breach or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement on the part of the other party that would cause the other party to fail to satisfy the applicable condition
to completion of the mergers related to accuracy of representations and warranties, performance of covenants and
agreements or the absence of a material adverse effect on the other party, and that breach or failure to perform
either is incapable of being cured by the end date or has not been cured within 30 days following notice from the
non-breaching party of such breach or failure to perform;

• by SYNNEX, if, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by Convergys shareholders:

• Convergys’ board of directors changes withdraws or modifies its recommendation that Convergys shareholders
adopt the merger agreement or recommends a takeover proposal; or

• Convergys has materially breached any of its obligations described under “The Merger Agreement—No
Solicitation,” which breach Convergys knew or should have known was a breach of such obligations; or

• by Convergys, if prior to the approval and adoption of the merger agreement at the Convergys special meeting,
Convergys enters into a definitive agreement relating to a superior acquisition proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Termination Fees and Expenses (See Page 155)

As more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreement, and subject to the terms and
conditions of the merger agreement, Convergys has agreed to pay SYNNEX a termination fee of $74.0 million if the merger
agreement is terminated under any of the following circumstances:

• by SYNNEX, if, prior to the adoption of the merger agreement by the Convergys shareholders:

• Convergys’ board of directors changes withdraws or modifies its recommendation that Convergys shareholders
adopt the merger agreement or recommends a takeover proposal; or

• Convergys has materially breached any of its obligations described under “The Merger Agreement—No
Solicitation,” which breach Convergys knew or should have known was a breach of such obligations; or

• by Convergys, if Convergys terminates the merger agreement to enter into a definitive agreement relating to a superior
acquisition proposal.

Furthermore, and as more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreement, Convergys
has agreed to pay SYNNEX $37.0 million if (i) a takeover proposal (as hereinafter defined, but substituting 50% for 20% in the
definition thereof) is publicly made and not withdrawn at least four business days prior to the Convergys special meeting, (ii)
thereafter the merger agreement is terminated by SYNNEX or Convergys because the Convergys shareholders fail to adopt the
merger agreement at the Convergys special meeting and (iii) Convergys completes or enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to such takeover proposal within the 12 months following such termination, with an additional $37.0 million payable by
Convergys to SYNNEX upon the consummation of such alternative transaction.

As more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreement, and on the terms and subject
to the conditions of the merger agreement, Convergys has agreed to pay SYNNEX an expense reimbursement fee of $12.35
million if the merger agreement is terminated by Convergys or SYNNEX because Convergys shareholders fail to adopt the
merger agreement upon a vote taken on a proposal to adopt the merger agreement at the Convergys special meeting. This expense
reimbursement is creditable against any termination fee subsequently payable.

In addition, as more fully described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the merger agreement, and subject to the
terms and conditions of the merger agreement, SYNNEX has agreed to pay Convergys an expense reimbursement fee of $12.35
million if the merger agreement is terminated by Convergys or SYNNEX because SYNNEX stockholders fail to approve the
stock issuance upon a vote taken on a proposal to approve the stock issuance at the SYNNEX special meeting.

See “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fee and Expenses” for a more complete description of the circumstances under
which Convergys will be required to pay a termination fee or Convergys or SYNNEX will be required to pay an expense
reimbursement.

Specific Performance (See Page 156)

Under the merger agreement, each of SYNNEX and Convergys is entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of the merger agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of the merger agreement.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences (See Page 124)

Although SYNNEX and Convergys have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to cause the initial merger, together with the
subsequent merger, to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, there can be no assurance
that the mergers will so qualify. In addition, the completion of the mergers is not conditioned on the mergers qualifying for the
intended tax treatment or upon the receipt of an opinion of counsel or IRS ruling to that effect, and whether or not the mergers
will qualify for the intended tax treatment depends on facts that will not be known until the mergers are completed. In particular,
the intended tax treatment requires that the value of the shares of SYNNEX common stock issued to Convergys shareholders in
the initial merger, determined as of the completion of the initial merger, represents at least a minimum percentage of the total
consideration paid to Convergys shareholders in the initial merger. While there is no specific guidance as to

TABLE OF CONTENTS

precisely what minimum percentage is necessary to satisfy this requirement, it would be satisfied if the SYNNEX common stock
(valued as of the completion of the initial merger) represents at least 40% of the total merger consideration. Because this test is
based on the value of SYNNEX common stock as of the completion of the initial merger, a decline in the value of SYNNEX
common stock could cause this requirement not to be met. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the mergers will qualify
for the intended tax treatment.

If the mergers qualify for the intended tax treatment as further described under “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the
Merger Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences,” a U.S. holder, as defined in such section, of Convergys common shares generally will not recognize any loss and
generally will recognize gain (if any) in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount by which the sum of the fair market value
of the shares of SYNNEX common stock and cash received by such holder exceeds such holder’s tax basis in its Convergys
common shares and (ii) the amount of cash received by such holder. If the mergers fail to qualify for the intended tax treatment,
as further described under “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the
Stock Issuance—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences,” a U.S. holder of Convergys common shares generally will
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the sum of the fair market value of the shares of
SYNNEX common stock and the amount of cash received by such holder (including cash received in lieu of a fractional share of
SYNNEX common stock) and (2) such holder’s tax basis in the Convergys common shares surrendered.

Each Convergys shareholder is urged to read the section “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and
SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” and to consult its tax
advisor to determine the particular U.S. federal, state or local or non-U.S. income or other tax consequences to it of the mergers.

Accounting Treatment (See Page 128)

The mergers will be accounted for as an acquisition of a business. SYNNEX will record assets acquired and liabilities
assumed from Convergys primarily at their respective fair values at the date of completion of the mergers. Any excess of the
purchase price (as described under Note 4 under “SYNNEX Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements”)
over the net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill.

Rights of Convergys Shareholders Will Change as a Result of the Mergers (See Page 169)

Convergys shareholders will have different rights once they become SYNNEX stockholders due to differences between the
organizational documents of SYNNEX and Convergys and differences between Delaware law, under which SYNNEX is
incorporated, and Ohio law, under which Convergys is incorporated. These differences are described in more detail under
“Comparison of Stockholder Rights.”

For the six months ended May 31, 2018, “Net income” and “Earnings per share attributable to SYNNEX” were impacted by
a charge of $24,701, or $0.62 per basic share and $0.61 per diluted share, respectively, related to transition tax on accumulated
overseas profits and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new U.S. tax rate related to the enactment of
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

For fiscal year ended November 30, 2013, the numerator for the computation of “Earnings per share attributable to
SYNNEX—Diluted” was adjusted for dilutive changes in the estimated value of the conversion premium of SYNNEX’
convertible debt from April 2013 through the final settlement date in August 2013. The adjustment to the numerator had the
effect of reducing SYNNEX’ “Earnings per share attributable to SYNNEX Corporation—Diluted” by $0.97 for the fiscal year
ended November 30, 2013.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EQUIVALENT AND COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION

The following table sets forth selected historical and unaudited pro forma combined per share information for SYNNEX and
Convergys.

Historical Per Share Information of SYNNEX and Convergys. The historical per share information of each of SYNNEX
and Convergys below is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of SYNNEX and Convergys as of, and for the
year ended November 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of
SYNNEX and Convergys as of, and for the six months ended May 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.

Unaudited Pro Forma Combined per Share of SYNNEX Common Stock Data. The unaudited pro forma combined per
share of SYNNEX common stock data set forth below give effect to the mergers under the acquisition method of accounting,
assuming that each outstanding Convergys common share had been converted into a share of SYNNEX common stock at the
exchange ratio. The unaudited pro forma combined earnings per share of SYNNEX common stock data set forth below give
effect to the mergers, as if the mergers had been effective on December 1, 2016, the first day of SYNNEX’ fiscal year ended
November 30, 2017. The unaudited pro forma combined book value per share of SYNNEX common stock data set forth below
give effect to the mergers, as if the mergers had been effective May 31, 2018. SYNNEX has been treated as the acquirer in the
mergers for accounting purposes.

The unaudited pro forma combined per share of SYNNEX common stock data is derived from the audited consolidated
financial statements of SYNNEX and Convergys as of, and for the year ended November 30, 2017 and December 31, 2017,
respectively, and the unaudited consolidated financial statements of SYNNEX and Convergys as of, and for the six months ended
May 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively.

The acquisition method of accounting is based on Financial Accounting Standards Board, Accounting Standards
Codification, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as ASC 805, Business Combinations, and uses the fair
value concepts defined in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which SYNNEX has adopted as required.
Acquisition accounting requires, among other things, that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair
values as of the acquisition date. Fair value measurements recorded in acquisition accounting are dependent upon certain
valuation studies of Convergys’ assets and liabilities and other studies that have yet to commence or progress to a stage where
there is sufficient information for a definitive measurement. Accordingly, the pro forma adjustments reflect the assets and
liabilities of Convergys at their preliminary estimated fair values. Differences between these preliminary estimates and the final
values in acquisition accounting will occur, and these differences could have a material impact on the unaudited pro forma
combined per share information set forth in the following table.

The unaudited pro forma combined per share of SYNNEX common stock data does not purport to represent the actual
results of operations that SYNNEX would have achieved had the companies been combined during these periods or to project the
future results of operations that SYNNEX may achieve after completion of the mergers.

Unaudited Pro Forma Combined per Convergys Equivalent Share Data. The unaudited pro forma combined per
Convergys equivalent share data set forth below shows the effect of the mergers from the perspective of an owner of Convergys
common shares. The information was calculated by multiplying the unaudited pro forma combined per share of SYNNEX
common stock amounts by the exchange ratio.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SYNNEX UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The SYNNEX Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements, which are referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements, presented below are derived from the historical
consolidated financial statements of SYNNEX and Convergys. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements are prepared as a
business combination and SYNNEX has been treated as the acquirer in the mergers for accounting purposes. The unaudited pro
forma condensed combined statements of operations have been prepared as if SYNNEX’ acquisition of Convergys had been
completed on December 1, 2016, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been prepared as if
SYNNEX’ acquisition of Convergys had been completed on May 31, 2018. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
statement of operations for the year ended November 30, 2017 does not give pro forma effect to the acquisitions of Tigerspike Pty
Limited and Westcon-Comstor Americas, which were acquired by SYNNEX during 2017, as these were not significant
individually or in the aggregate.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements are developed from and should be read in conjunction with the following
separate historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of SYNNEX and Convergys filed with the SEC and
incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus: (a) the unaudited consolidated financial statements of
SYNNEX contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May 31, 2018; (b) the unaudited
consolidated financial statements of Convergys contained in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended
June 30, 2018; (c) the audited consolidated financial statements of SYNNEX contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended November 30, 2017; and (d) the audited consolidated financial statements of Convergys contained in its Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.

SYNNEX and Convergys have different fiscal years. SYNNEX’ fiscal year ends on November 30, whereas Convergys’
fiscal year ends on December 31. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and statements of operations have
been prepared utilizing period ends that differ by less than 93 days, as permitted by Rule 11-02 Regulation S-X. The unaudited
pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of May 31, 2018 combines SYNNEX’ balance sheet as of May 31, 2018 with
the Convergys balance sheet as of June 30, 2018. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the
year ended November 30, 2017 combines the year ended November 30, 2017 for SYNNEX and the year ended December 31,
2017 for Convergys. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the six months ended May 31,
2018 includes the six months ended May 31, 2018 for SYNNEX and the six months ended June 30, 2018 for Convergys.

As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, SYNNEX has not completed the detailed valuation studies necessary to
arrive at the final estimates of the fair market value of the Convergys assets to be acquired and the liabilities to be assumed and
the related allocations of purchase price, nor has it identified all adjustments necessary to conform Convergys to SYNNEX’
accounting policies. As indicated in Note 5 to the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements, based on information currently
available to it, SYNNEX has made certain adjustments to the historical book values of the assets and liabilities of Convergys to
reflect preliminary estimates of the fair values necessary to prepare the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements, with the
excess of the purchase price over the adjusted historical net assets of Convergys recorded as goodwill. Actual results may differ
from these Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements once the mergers are completed and SYNNEX has determined the final
purchase price for Convergys and has completed the valuation studies necessary to finalize the required purchase price allocations
and identified any additional conforming accounting policy changes for Convergys. There can be no assurance that such
finalization will not result in material changes.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations have been prepared to reflect adjustments to
SYNNEX’ historical consolidated financial information that are (i) directly attributable to the acquisition of Convergys, (ii)
factually supportable and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on SYNNEX’ results. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined balance sheet as of May 31, 2018 is required to include factually supportable adjustments which give effect to events
that are directly attributable to the mergers regardless of whether they are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined
results or are non-recurring.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent
what the actual consolidated results of operations of SYNNEX would have been had the Convergys acquisition occurred on the
dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements do not include the realization of cost savings from operating efficiencies, revenue
synergies or other integration costs expected to result from the Convergys acquisition.

NOTES TO THE SYNNEX UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(currency and share amounts in millions, except for per share amounts)
(amounts may not add or compute due to rounding)

Note 1. Description of the Transaction

On June 28, 2018, SYNNEX, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and Convergys entered into an agreement, pursuant to which,
Merger Sub I will merge with and into Convergys, followed immediately by the merger of the surviving corporation with and into
Merger Sub II. Upon the closing of the transaction, the surviving company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX.

Upon completion of the initial merger, each Convergys common share issued and outstanding will be exchanged for (1)
$13.25 per share in cash plus (2) a number of shares of SYNNEX common stock equal to the exchange ratio determined based on
the 20 day volume weighted average trading price of SYNNEX’ stock three trading days prior to closing, which is referred to in
the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements as the SYNNEX average closing price. If the 20 day volume weighted average
trading price of SYNNEX’ stock three trading days prior to closing is $111.0766, which is referred to in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Financial Statements as the base trading price, the exchange ratio will be 0.1193, which is referred to in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Financial Statements as the base exchange ratio. Variations in the SYNNEX average closing price from the base trading price will
result in changes to the exchange ratio as follows:
SYNNEX Average Closing Price Approximate Exchange Ratio
Less than $94.4151 (85% of base trading price) 0.1263
$94.4151 or greater but less than $99.9689 (90% of base trading price) Between 0.1263(1) and 0.1193
Between $99.9689 and $122.1843 (110% of base trading price) (both included) 0.1193
Greater than $122.1843 and up to $127.7381 (115% of base trading price) Between 0.1193(2) and 0.1141
Greater than $127.7381 0.1141

(1) if the SYNNEX average closing price is greater than or equal to 85% of the base trading price and less than 90% of the base trading price, the base
exchange ratio multiplied by the quotient of (A) 90% of the base trading price, divided by (B) the SYNNEX average closing price.

(2) if the SYNNEX average closing price is greater than 110% of the base trading price and less than or equal to 115% of the base trading price, the base
exchange ratio multiplied by the quotient of (A) 110% of the base trading price, divided by (B) the SYNNEX average closing price.

As of the completion of the initial merger, each option to purchase Convergys common shares, which is referred to in the
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements as a Convergys option, that is outstanding as of the effective time of the initial
merger: (i) that has an exercise price per Convergys common share that is less than the product of the average closing price of
SYNNEX common stock multiplied by the exchange ratio, which is referred to in the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements
as the cash equivalent merger consideration, will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash amount equal to, for
each Convergys common share underlying such Convergys option, the excess of (x) the cash equivalent merger consideration
over (y) the applicable per share exercise price of the Convergys option or (ii) that has an exercise price per Convergys common
share that is greater than or equal to the cash equivalent merger consideration, will be cancelled for no consideration.

As of the completion of the mergers, or such later date as payment may be made to comply with applicable tax rules, each
Convergys DSU will be cash settled by SYNNEX at the higher of the cash equivalent merger consideration or an amount equal to
the average of the opening and closing prices per Convergys common share on the NYSE on the trading day immediately
preceding the closing date of the mergers.

As of the completion of the mergers, each Convergys RSU and each Convergys PSU (with each Convergys PSU covering a
number of shares equal to the greater of the number of shares that would be earned at the target level of performance or the level
of performance determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement), will be cash settled by SYNNEX at the higher of
the cash equivalent merger consideration or an amount equal to the average of the opening and closing prices per Convergys
common share on the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date of the mergers. Such amount will be
payable promptly following the

completion of the initial merger, or such later date as payment may be made to comply with applicable tax rules, provided that, in
the case of a Convergys RSU or Convergys PSU that was granted on or after March 31, 2016 (other than a Convergys RSU or
Convergys PSU that is held by a non-employee director or that becomes vested at the completion of the initial merger pursuant to
the terms of an applicable contract), such amount will be payable on the original vesting dates in accordance with the terms of the
applicable award agreement.

During 2009, Convergys issued $125.0 aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures. The convertible debentures
are convertible at the option of the holders upon a fundamental change and make-whole fundamental change under Convergys’
existing indenture, dated as of October 13, 2009, with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, which is referred to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as the existing indenture. The mergers constitute a fundamental change and a make-whole
fundamental change under the existing indenture, as all of the Convergys common shares will be held by SYNNEX upon
consummation of the mergers and at least 90% of the consideration for those shares will not consist of NYSE or NASDAQ listed
common shares since there is a sizeable cash component to be paid for each Convergys common share as described above. Upon
conversion, following the closing of the mergers, the convertible debentures would be convertible into either cash or a
combination of cash and shares of SYNNEX common stock, at the election of Merger Sub II, as successor to Convergys. The
convertible debentures were convertible, subject to certain conditions, into common shares of Convergys at an initial conversion
rate of 82.8219 shares per one thousand dollars in principal amount of debentures, or an implied conversion price of
approximately $12.07 per share. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment for certain events outlined in the existing indenture,
including payment of cash dividends. As of June 30, 2018, the conversion rate, as adjusted for dividends, for the convertible
debentures was 90.3682 shares per one thousand dollars in principal amount of debentures or an implied conversion price of
approximately $11.07 per share. In the event Convergys declares an additional dividend prior to closing, the conversion rate will
again be adjusted. In case of a conversion in connection with a make-whole fundamental change, the conversion rate will be
increased by a number of additional Convergys common shares equal to a percentage of the applicable conversion rate. The
percentage increase shall be determined by reference to the table below (as adjusted in accordance with the existing indenture),
based on the date on which the make-whole fundamental change occurs or becomes effective and the average of Convergys’
closing price per common share over the five trading days immediately preceding the effective date, as a percentage of the
reference price of $9.6593 per share, subject to a maximum of 125% of the implied conversion rate:

Convergys’ Share Price as a
Percentage of the Reference Price(1)

Effective date(1)

September 15, 2017 September 15, 2018 September 15, 2019
91.7%  27.28%  27.28%  27.28%
100.8%  16.04%  15.82%  15.82%
114.6%  12.11%  11.46%  11.13%
123.7%  10.15%  9.17%  8.73%
137.5%  8.07%  6.33%  5.56%

366.6%  1.64%  0.65%  0.00%
458.3%  1.20%  0.44%  0.00%
549.9%  0.87%  0.33%  0.00%

(1) If Convergys’ share price as a percentage of the reference price is between two share prices as a percentage of the reference price in the table above or the
effective date is between two effective dates in the table above, the percentage increase shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the
percentage increase set forth for the higher and lower share prices as a percentage of the reference price and the earlier and later effective dates, as
applicable, based on a 365-day year.

The aggregate purchase consideration in the mergers is based on an estimated SYNNEX average closing price and the
number of Convergys common shares and equity awards outstanding on July 31, 2018, and assuming holders of convertible
debentures exercise their option to convert in connection with the make-whole fundamental change and that SYNNEX elects to
settle the conversions solely in cash, the purchase price would be approximately $2,559.0 (see Note 3).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

To finance the mergers and repay certain indebtedness, SYNNEX has obtained long-term term loan commitments of $1,800
in the aggregate (see Note 5A).

Note 2. Basis of Pro Forma Presentation

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements are derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of
SYNNEX and Convergys. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements are prepared as a business combination using the
acquisition method, and SYNNEX has been treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statements of operations have been prepared as if SYNNEX’ acquisition of Convergys had been completed on
December 1, 2016, and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been prepared as if SYNNEX’
acquisition of Convergys had been completed on May 31, 2018. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of
operations for the year ended November 30, 2017 does not give pro forma effect to the acquisitions of Tigerspike Pty Limited and
Westcon-Comstor Americas, which were acquired by SYNNEX during 2017, as these were not significant individually or in the
aggregate.

As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, SYNNEX has not performed the detailed valuation studies necessary to
arrive at the final estimates of the fair value of the Convergys assets to be acquired, the liabilities to be assumed and the related
allocations of purchase price. As indicated in Note 5 to the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements, SYNNEX has made
certain adjustments to the historical book values of the assets and liabilities of Convergys to reflect preliminary estimates of fair
value necessary to prepare the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements, with the excess of the purchase price over the adjusted
historical net assets of Convergys, recorded as goodwill. Actual results may differ from these Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Statements once the mergers are completed and SYNNEX has determined the final purchase price for Convergys and has
completed the valuation studies necessary to finalize the required purchase price allocations and identified any additional
conforming accounting policy changes for Convergys. There can be no assurance that such finalization will not result in material
changes.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations have been prepared to reflect adjustments to
SYNNEX’ historical consolidated financial information that are (i) directly attributable to the acquisition of Convergys, (ii)
factually supportable and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on SYNNEX’ results. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined balance sheet as of May 31, 2018 is required to include factually supportable adjustments which give effect to events
that are directly attributable to the mergers regardless of whether they are expected to have a continuing impact on the combined
results or are non-recurring. Therefore, acquisition-related transaction costs expected to be incurred by SYNNEX and Convergys
subsequent to May 31, 2018 are reflected as a pro forma adjustment to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance
sheet as of May 31, 2018, with the impact presented as an increase to accounts payable and other liabilities and a decrease to
retained earnings. Further, one-time acquisition-related expenses anticipated to be incurred prior to, or concurrent with, the
closing of the mergers are not included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations.

The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not give
effect to any cost savings from operating efficiencies, revenue synergies or costs for the integration of SYNNEX and Convergys’
operations. The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to
represent what the actual consolidated results of operations of SYNNEX would have been had the Convergys acquisition
occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations or consolidated
financial position. Although SYNNEX projects that significant cost savings will result from the mergers, there can be no
assurance that these cost savings will be achieved. Any restructuring or integration costs will be expensed in the appropriate
accounting periods after completion of the mergers.

Accounting periods presented

SYNNEX and Convergys have different fiscal years. SYNNEX’ fiscal year ends on November 30, whereas Convergys’
fiscal year follows a December 31 fiscal year-end. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and statements of
operations have been prepared utilizing period ends that differ by less than 93 days, as permitted by Rule 11-02 Regulation S-X.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of May 31, 2018 is presented as if the acquisition and issuance of
SYNNEX common stock to

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Convergys shareholders had occurred on May 31, 2018 and combines SYNNEX’ balance sheet as of May 31, 2018 with the
Convergys balance sheet as of June 30, 2018. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year
ended November 30, 2017 combines the historical results of SYNNEX for the year ended November 30, 2017 and the historical
results of Convergys for the year ended December 31, 2017. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of
operations for the six months ended May 31, 2018 includes the six months ended May 31, 2018 for SYNNEX and the six months
ended June 30, 2018 for Convergys.

Conforming accounting policies

SYNNEX has identified certain differences in accounting policies related primarily to the timing of adoption by SYNNEX
and Convergys of the following new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board:

• Accounting Standards Update, or ASU 2018-02—Income statement—Reporting comprehensive income (Topic 220)—
Reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income.

• ASU 2017-12—Targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities.

• ASU 2017-04—Simplifying the test for goodwill impairment.

• ASU 2016-16—Income taxes (Topic 740): Intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory.

• ASU 2016-09—Compensation—Stock compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to employee share-based payment
accounting.

• ASU 2016-01—Financial instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10).

• ASU 2014-09—Revenue from contracts with customers (Topic 606).

As the adoption or expected adoption of these accounting pronouncements is not material to Convergys’ historical results of
operations, and Convergys’ shareholders’ equity is eliminated as part of the pro forma adjustments (see Note 5H), no pro forma
adjustments have been recorded to conform Convergys’ accounting policies related to these pronouncements to SYNNEX’
accounting policies. Following the completion of the mergers, SYNNEX will review Convergys’ accounting policies. As a result
of that review, SYNNEX may identify additional differences between the accounting policies of the two companies that, when
conformed, could have a material impact on the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements. At this time, SYNNEX is not aware
of any differences that would have a material impact on the combined financial statements, and therefore, the Unaudited Pro
Forma Financial Statements assume there are no differences in accounting policies. As described in Note 5(I), certain
reclassifications have been recorded to conform Convergys’ financial statement presentation with SYNNEX’ presentation. Upon
completion of the mergers, further reclassification adjustments may be necessary.

Note 3. Estimated Purchase Price

The estimated purchase price allocation included with these Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements is based upon an
estimated purchase price on July 31, 2018. The estimated purchase consideration, together with a sensitivity analysis for the
range of potential variations in the exchange ratio is calculated as follows:

maximum and minimum exchange of shares of SYNNEX common stock, the SYNNEX share price is based on 85% and 115% respectively of base trading
price described in Note 1 above.

(4) SYNNEX average closing price is determined by estimating the 20 day volume weighted average closing price as on July 31, 2018. For calculating the
purchase consideration based on the maximum and minimum exchange of SYNNEX shares, the SYNNEX average closing price is assumed to be 85% and
115% respectively of base trading price described in Note 1 above.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In addition to the RSUs and PSUs included in the purchase consideration in the table above, 0.3 Convergys RSU and 0.5
Convergys PSU awards (for purposes hereof, assuming the maximum level of achievement) will be cash settled upon closing. At
July 31, 2018, SYNNEX is unable to reasonably estimate the respective amounts attributable to pre- and post-merger services.
Unvested Convergys outstanding equity awards, comprising approximately 0.9 Convergys RSUs and 0.5 Convergys PSUs (for
purposes hereof, assuming the maximum level of achievement), granted to Convergys employees will not be settled upon
completion of the mergers, and instead will be cash settled by SYNNEX at the cash equivalent merger consideration but payable
on the original vesting dates and terms. The fair value attributable to post-merger services will be recorded as compensation
expense in SYNNEX’ post-merger financial statements. At this time, SYNNEX is unable to reasonably estimate the respective
amounts attributable to pre- and post-merger services.

It is assumed that all shares of SYNNEX common stock issued will be new issuances. However, SYNNEX may issue
treasury shares for a portion of the required shares of SYNNEX common stock. The actual number of newly issued shares of
SYNNEX common stock or treasury shares to be delivered in connection with the transaction will be based upon the number of
Convergys common shares issued and outstanding when the transaction closes and the SYNNEX average closing price.

As the conversion amount of the convertible debentures is greater than the principal amount of $125.0, it is assumed that all
holders of the convertible debentures will exercise their option to convert their debentures in accordance with their terms at a
temporarily increased conversion rate shortly following the closing of the mergers (although the holders’ actual decisions will
depend upon their judgments based on the prevailing market conditions). For the purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma Financial
Statements, it is assumed that Merger Sub II, as successor to Convergys, which would then be a subsidiary of SYNNEX, will
settle the conversions in cash in accordance with the existing indenture and accordingly, this amount has been included as part of
the cash purchase consideration. A change in the Convergys common share price as described in Note 1 above could have a
material impact on the actual convertible debentures conversion amount and correspondingly on the actual purchase
consideration.

The estimated total consideration expected to be transferred reflected in these Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements
does not purport to represent the actual consideration that will be transferred when the mergers are completed. In accordance with
ASC 805, the fair value of equity securities issued as part of the consideration transferred will be measured on the date the
mergers are completed at the then-current market price. In addition, the cash consideration payable will be determined based on
the SYNNEX average closing price upon completion of the mergers. This requirement will likely result in a different value of the
common stock component of the purchase consideration and a per share equity component different from the values assumed in
these Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements, and that difference may be material. As described in Note 1, and seen in the
table above, an increase or decrease between certain thresholds in the SYNNEX stock price from the base trading price will result
in a change in the exchange ratio and a partially offsetting decrease or increase in the number of shares of SYNNEX common
stock to be issued. However, a change in the price of shares of SYNNEX common stock beyond the defined thresholds described
in Note 1 or a material change between the SYNNEX average closing price and the price of shares of SYNNEX common stock
on the day of closing could have a material impact on the actual purchase consideration.

Note 4. Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation

The following reflects the preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase consideration to identifiable net assets to be
acquired and liabilities to be assumed. The excess of the estimated purchase consideration over the preliminary net tangible assets
and preliminary intangible assets was recorded as goodwill:
 Estimated fair value

Purchase consideration $ 2,559.0 
Estimated purchase price allocation    
Historical book value of Convergys equity $ 1,350.3 
Convergys convertible debentures assumed to be converted due to change in control provisions related to

the mergers, net of unamortized debt discount of $1.3  123.7 
Less:    

Elimination of historical Convergys goodwill  (933.6)
Elimination of historical Convergys intangibles  (272.2)
Elimination of Convergys deferred contract acquisition costs  (5.5)
Elimination of deferred taxes on Convergys convertible debentures  70.9 
Elimination of deferred taxes on historical Convergys intangibles  191.3 
Elimination of deferred taxes on certain other historical Convergys items  (3.3)

Add:    
Preliminary Fair value of identifiable intangible assets  1,360.0 
Deferred tax impact of identifiable intangible assets  (380.8)

Preliminary estimate of fair value of identifiable net assets acquired $ 1,500.8 
Goodwill $ 1,058.2 

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements reflect a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to identifiable assets
and liabilities and unless otherwise noted in Note 5, fair values are assumed to approximate historical book values as of May 31,
2018. The remaining unallocated purchase price was allocated to goodwill. The final purchase price allocations, which will be
based on third-party valuations, may result in different allocations for tangible and intangible assets than presented in these
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements, and those differences could be material.

Note 5. Pro Forma Adjustments

(A) The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted as indicated below to record the issuance
of SYNNEX term loans, net of debt issuance costs and cash payments to Convergys shareholders, option holders and Convergys
DSU holders. To finance the mergers and repay certain indebtedness, SYNNEX has obtained long-term term loan commitments
aggregating $1,800. The actual amount may vary and will be determined based on the estimated cash component of the purchase
consideration and other planned cash utilization prior to closing of the mergers. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
balance sheet assumes that the term loans of $1,800 would be entered into at, or near the closing of the transaction with maturities
of 5 years, with an assumed weighted average interest rate of 3.76%, including 17 basis points of debt issuance cost. The loans
will be repayable in equal quarterly installments of 1.25% of the original principal amount, commencing at the end of the second
full fiscal quarter after the initial funding date, with the balance payable on the final maturity date.
To record cash proceeds from term loans (installments repayable within a year) $ 67.5 
To record cash proceeds from term loans (installments repayable after a year)  1,732.5

(B) To eliminate the historical carrying amounts of Convergys’ deferred contract acquisition costs of $2.7 and $2.8 from
Other current assets and Other assets, respectively, as there is no future economic benefit associated with these assets. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations have been adjusted to eliminate $1.3 and $1.5 of Convergys’
amortization of deferred contract costs for the year ended November 30, 2017 and six months ended May 31, 2018, respectively.

(C) To eliminate Convergys’ historical goodwill and record the preliminary estimate of goodwill as a result of the
Acquisition:
 Convergys historical amount Estimated goodwill Net adjustment

Goodwill (see Note 4 above) $ 933.6 $ 1,058.2 $ 124.6 

(D) To eliminate the historical amounts of Convergys’ intangible assets, net and record the estimated fair values of the
intangible assets acquired in connection with the mergers and associated amortization expenses. As of completion of the mergers,
identifiable intangible assets are required to be measured at fair value, and these acquired assets could include assets that are not
intended to be used or sold or that are intended to be used in a manner other than their highest and best use.

The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is determined primarily using variations of the “income approach,” which is
based on the present value of the future after-tax cash flows attributable to each identifiable intangible asset. Other valuation
methods, including the market approach and cost approach, were also considered in estimating the fair value. As of the date of
this joint proxy statement/prospectus, SYNNEX does not have sufficient information as to the amount, timing and risk of the cash
flows from all of Convergys’ identifiable intangible assets to determine their fair value. Some of the more significant assumptions
inherent in the development of intangible asset values, from the perspective of a market participant, include, but are not limited
to: the amount and timing of projected future cash flows (including revenue and profitability); the discount rate selected to
measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows; the assessment of the asset’s life cycle; and the competitive trends impacting
the asset. However, for purposes of these Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements and using historical acquisition experience,
economic factors and publicly available information, such as historical revenues, Convergys’ cost structure and certain other
high-level assumptions, the fair value of Convergys’ identifiable intangible assets and their weighted-average useful lives have
been preliminarily estimated as follows:

Total estimated intangible assets $ 272.2 $ 1,360.0 $ 1,087.8 $ 147.6 $ 70.5  
Elimination of the historical amortization

of Convergys’ intangible assets           28.9  13.1  
Total increase in amortization of

intangible assets          $ 118.7 $ 57.4  

Amortization of customer relationships and others is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Amortization
of technology is recorded in cost of services revenue.

These preliminary estimates of fair value and weighted-average useful life will likely be different from the amounts included
in the final acquisition accounting, and the difference could have a material impact on the accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma
Financial Statements. Once SYNNEX has full access to information about Convergys’ intangible assets, additional insight will be
gained that could impact (i) the estimated total value assigned to identifiable intangible assets and/or (ii) the estimated weighted-
average useful life of each category of intangible assets. The estimated intangible asset values and their useful lives could be
impacted by a variety of

factors that may become known to SYNNEX only upon access to additional information and/or by changes in such factors that
may occur prior to completion of the mergers. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the regulatory, legislative,
legal, technological and/or competitive environments. Increased knowledge about these and/or other elements could result in a
change to the estimated fair value of the identifiable Convergys intangible assets and/or to the estimated weighted-average useful
lives from what SYNNEX has assumed in these Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements. The combined effect of any such
changes could then also result in a significant increase or decrease to SYNNEX’ estimate of associated amortization expense.

(E) As of the completion of the mergers, SYNNEX will establish net deferred tax liabilities and make other tax adjustments
as part of the accounting for the mergers, primarily related to estimated fair value adjustments for identifiable intangible assets
and convertible debt. Deferred taxes are recognized for the temporary difference between assigned values in the purchase price
allocation and the carryover tax bases of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The pro forma adjustments to record the effect of
deferred taxes was computed as follows:
Estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets to be acquired $ 1,360.0 
Deferred tax liabilities associated with the estimated fair value of identified intangible assets to be

acquired, at 28%(1)  (380.8)
Pro Forma Adjustments to Deferred Taxes:    

Elimination of deferred taxes on Convergys convertible debentures  70.9 
Elimination of deferred taxes on historical Convergys intangibles  191.3 
Elimination of deferred taxes on certain other historical Convergys items  (3.3)

Deferred taxes associated with the estimated fair value adjustments of assets to be acquired and liabilities
to be assumed $ (121.9)

(1) SYNNEX assumed a 28% tax rate when estimating the deferred tax impacts of the acquisition, which is based on the applicable statutory rate as of the
assumed acquisition date and appropriately reflects certain SYNNEX and Convergys bases differences that will not result in taxable or deductible amounts
in future years when the related financial reporting asset or liability will be recovered or settled.

(F) The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to reclassify Convergys’ borrowings of
$54.0 under its asset securitization facility and historically reported as long-term debt, as current borrowings in conformity with
SYNNEX classification of revolving lines of credit. Amounts drawn under this facility are classified as long-term debt within the
Convergys’ historical balance sheet, based on its ability and intent to refinance on a long-term basis.

(G) As described in Note 3, the convertible debentures are assumed to be converted in connection with the mergers.
Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to eliminate the liability and equity
components of the convertible debentures of $125.0, net of debt discount of $1.3. The entire debt discount was recorded within
long-term debt and capital lease obligations in Convergys’ historical financial statements.
 June 30, 2018
Liability component of the Convergys convertible debentures $ 65.3 
Equity component of the Convergys convertible debentures  58.4 
Convergys convertible debentures, net of debt discount $ 123.7 

(H) The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to eliminate Convergys’ historical
shareholders’ equity accounts.

(I) Reclassifications have been made to the presentation of Convergys’ historical financial statements in order to conform to
SYNNEX’ presentation. During the year ended November 30, 2017, Convergys’ Depreciation, Restructuring costs and
Transaction and integration costs have been reclassified as Selling, general and administrative expenses in the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined statement of operations. During the six months ended May 31, 2018, Convergys’ Depreciation and
Restructuring costs have been reclassified as Selling, general and administrative expenses in the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statement of operations.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(J) The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the six months ended May 31, 2018 has been
adjusted to eliminate costs of $10.2 incurred by Convergys in connection with the mergers. The unaudited pro forma condensed
combined balance sheet as of May 31, 2018 has been adjusted to record estimated acquisition-related transaction costs of $63.8
($45.9, net of taxes) expected to be incurred subsequent to May 31, 2018, with the net of tax impact presented as an increase to
accounts payable and other liabilities and a decrease to retained earnings. Total estimated acquisition-related transaction costs to
be incurred by SYNNEX and Convergys are approximately $14.8 and $49.0, respectively. A corresponding tax benefit of $17.9
has been recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities. To the extent, the estimated Convergys costs of $49.0 are incurred
prior to the closing of the mergers, these costs will not form part of the combined retained earnings as Convergys’ historical
shareholders’ equity accounts will be eliminated upon acquisition (see Note 5H).

(K) The unaudited pro forma statements of operations have been adjusted to record estimated additional interest expense
related to the estimated $1,800 of borrowings that will be used by SYNNEX to fund the mergers and eliminate the historical
interest expense associated with the convertible debentures, which are assumed to be settled upon closing of the mergers (see
Note 3). The weighted average interest rate on the term loans is estimated to be 3.76%, including 17 basis points of debt issuance
cost. In addition, the expected increase in the SYNNEX leverage ratio due to the borrowings to finance the mergers is estimated
to result in additional interest expense of approximately 0.51% related to the existing term loans.

(L) The unaudited pro forma statements of operations have been adjusted to reflect the aggregate pro forma income tax
effect of the pro forma adjustments above. SYNNEX assumed a blended tax rate of 35% and 28% for the year ended November
30, 2017 and six months ended May 31, 2018, respectively, when estimating the tax impact of the mergers, representing the
federal statutory tax rate applicable to each period and exclusion of any state tax impacts that are unknown as of the date of this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. Such unknown amounts are expected to be immaterial. The pro forma combined provision for
income taxes does not reflect the amounts that would have resulted had SYNNEX and Convergys filed consolidated income tax
returns during the periods presented. The blended tax rates are estimates and do not take into account future income tax strategies
that may be applied to the combined entity.

SYNNEX’ historical Consolidated Statement of Operations for the six months ended May 31, 2018 reflects a charge of
$24.7 related to transition tax on accumulated overseas profits and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to the
new U.S. tax rate related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Convergys’ historical Consolidated Statements
of Income reflect charges of $34.1 and $2.3 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and six months ended June 30, 2018,
respectively, related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. These amounts are provisional and final adjustments may materially
impact the combined income tax provision in the period in which the adjustments are made as each company completes its
analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

(N) The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements do not present a combined dividend per share amount. On each of
January 31, 2018, April 27, 2018 and July 27, 2018, SYNNEX paid a dividend of $0.35 per share of SYNNEX common stock.
On each of January 5, 2018 and April 6, 2018, Convergys paid a dividend of $0.10 per Convergys common share, and on July 6,
2018, Convergys paid a dividend of $0.11 per Convergys share. Under the terms of the merger agreement, during the period prior
to completion of the mergers, SYNNEX and Convergys are not permitted to declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other
distribution other than their regular cash dividends in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices and subject to
certain limitations. The dividend policy of SYNNEX following completion of the mergers will be determined by SYNNEX’
board of directors.

Note 6. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Mergers

The Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Statements assume that the mergers qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal
income tax purposes.

COMPARATIVE PER SHARE MARKET PRICE AND DIVIDEND INFORMATION

Market Prices

The following table sets forth, for the fiscal periods indicated, the intra-day high and low sales prices per share of SYNNEX

The following table sets forth the closing sale price per share of SYNNEX common stock and Convergys common share as
reported on the NYSE on June 28, 2018, the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger agreement, and on
August 23, 2018, the most recent trading day prior to the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for which this information
was available. The table also shows the implied value of the merger consideration for each Convergys common share as of the
same two dates. This implied value was calculated by multiplying the closing sale price of a share of SYNNEX common stock on
the relevant date by the applicable exchange ratio and adding the cash component of the merger consideration, or $13.25.

The market prices of shares of SYNNEX common stock and Convergys common shares have fluctuated since the date of the
announcement of the merger agreement and will continue to fluctuate from the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to the
date of the Convergys special meeting and the date the mergers are completed and thereafter. No assurance can be given
concerning the market prices of shares of SYNNEX common stock or Convergys common shares before completion of the
mergers or shares of SYNNEX common stock after completion of the mergers. The exchange ratio is determined based on the 20
day volume weighted average trading price of shares of SYNNEX common stock three trading days prior to the closing of the
mergers. The market price of shares of SYNNEX common stock (and therefore the value of the merger consideration) when
received by Convergys shareholders after the mergers are completed could be greater than, less than or the same as shown in the
table above. Accordingly, Convergys shareholders are advised to obtain current market quotations for shares of SYNNEX
common stock and Convergys common shares in deciding whether to vote for adoption of the merger agreement.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Dividends

SYNNEX currently pays a quarterly dividend on shares of SYNNEX common stock and last paid a dividend on July 27,
2018, of $0.35 per share.

Convergys currently pays a quarterly dividend on Convergys common shares and last paid a dividend on July 6, 2018, of
$0.11 per share. Under the terms of the merger agreement, during the period before completion of the mergers, Convergys is not
permitted to declare, set aside or pay any dividend or other distribution other than its regular cash dividend in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice in an amount not to exceed $0.11 per share per quarter.

After completion of the mergers, each former Convergys shareholder who holds shares of SYNNEX common stock into
which Convergys common shares have been converted in connection with the mergers will receive whatever dividends are
declared and paid on shares of SYNNEX common stock. However, no dividend or other distribution having a record date after
completion of the mergers will actually be paid with respect to any shares of SYNNEX common stock into which Convergys
common shares have been converted in connection with the mergers until the certificates formerly representing Convergys
common shares have been surrendered (or evidence of shares in book-entry form formerly representing Convergys common
shares have been transferred), at which time any accrued dividends and other distributions on those shares of SYNNEX common
stock will be paid without interest. Subject to the limitations set forth in the merger agreement described above, any future
dividends by SYNNEX will be made at the discretion of SYNNEX’ board of directors. Subject to the limitations set forth in the
merger agreement described above, any future dividends by Convergys will be made at the discretion of Convergys’ board of
directors. There can be no assurance that any future dividends will be declared or paid by SYNNEX or Convergys or as to the
amount or timing of those dividends, if any.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus,
including the matters addressed in “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” you should carefully consider
the following risk factors in determining whether to vote for the adoption of the merger agreement and/or the approval of the stock
issuance. You should also read and consider the risk factors associated with each of the businesses of SYNNEX and Convergys
because these risk factors may affect the operations and financial results of the combined company. These risk factors may be found
under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in each company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2017 and
December 31, 2017, respectively, and under Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in SYNNEX’ Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly periods ended May 31, 2018 and February 28, 2018 and Convergys’ Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly
periods ended June 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, each of which is on file with the SEC and all of which are incorporated by
reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Because the exchange ratio is fixed for price fluctuations in shares of SYNNEX common stock of less than 10% and more
than 15% from a base price, Convergys shareholders cannot be sure of the value of the merger consideration they will
receive in the mergers.

Upon completion of the initial merger, each Convergys common share outstanding immediately prior to the mergers (other than
those held by Convergys as treasury stock, by SYNNEX or by any subsidiary of Convergys or SYNNEX or with respect to which
appraisal rights have been properly exercised in accordance with the OGCL) will be converted into the right to receive $13.25 in
cash, without interest, and 0.1193 shares of SYNNEX common stock, subject to adjustment as provided in the merger agreement in
the event that the trading price of shares of SYNNEX common stock prior to the closing of the mergers increases or decreases by
more than 10% from a base price of $111.0766. Because the exchange ratio is fixed for price fluctuations in shares of SYNNEX
common stock of less than 10% and more than 15% from a base price, the value of the stock portion of the merger consideration
will depend on the market price of shares of SYNNEX common stock at the time the mergers are completed. The market price of
shares of SYNNEX common stock has fluctuated since the date of the announcement of the merger agreement and will continue to
fluctuate from the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to the date of the Convergys special meeting and the date the
mergers are completed, which could occur a considerable amount of time after the date of the Convergys special meeting, and
thereafter. Accordingly, at the time of the Convergys special meeting, Convergys shareholders will not know or be able to determine
the market value of the merger consideration they would receive upon completion of the mergers. Stock price changes may result
from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in SYNNEX’ and Convergys’
respective businesses, operations and prospects, market assessments of the likelihood that the mergers will be completed, the timing
of the mergers and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond SYNNEX’ and Convergys’ control. SYNNEX
stockholders and Convergys shareholders are urged to obtain current market quotations for shares of SYNNEX common stock in
deciding whether to vote for the stock issuance or the adoption of the merger agreement, as applicable.

The market price of shares of SYNNEX common stock after the mergers may be affected by factors different from those
that are currently affecting or historically have affected the market price of Convergys common shares.

Upon completion of the mergers, holders of Convergys common shares will become holders of SYNNEX common stock. The
businesses of SYNNEX differ from those of Convergys in important respects and, accordingly, the results of operations of
SYNNEX after the mergers, as well as the market price of SYNNEX common stock, may be affected by factors different from those
that are currently affecting or historically have affected the results of operations of Convergys as a stand-alone public company, as
well as the market price of Convergys common shares. For further information on the respective businesses of SYNNEX and
Convergys and certain factors to consider in connection with those businesses, see the documents incorporated by reference into this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and referred to under “Where You Can Find More Information.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

After completion of the mergers, SYNNEX may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the mergers, which
could adversely affect the value of shares of SYNNEX common stock.

The success of the mergers will depend, in part, on SYNNEX’ ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from
combining the businesses of SYNNEX and Convergys. SYNNEX’ ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is
subject to certain risks including:

• SYNNEX’ ability to successfully combine the businesses of SYNNEX and Convergys;

• whether the combined businesses will perform as expected;

• the possibility that SYNNEX paid more for Convergys than the value it will derive from the mergers;

• the reduction of SYNNEX’ cash available for operations and other uses and the incurrence of indebtedness to finance the
mergers; and

• the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of Convergys.

If SYNNEX is not able to successfully combine the businesses of SYNNEX and Convergys within the anticipated time frame,
or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the mergers may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to
realize than expected, the combined businesses may not perform as expected and the value of the shares of SYNNEX common stock
may be adversely affected.

SYNNEX and Convergys have operated and, until completion of the mergers will continue to operate, independently, and there
can be no assurances that their businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the
loss of key SYNNEX or Convergys employees, the disruption of either or both companies’ ongoing businesses or in unexpected
integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than
originally anticipated. Specifically, issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of Convergys and SYNNEX in order
to realize the anticipated benefits of the mergers so the combined business performs as expected include, among other things:

• integrating the companies’ technologies, products and services;

• identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;

• harmonizing the companies’ operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls
and other policies, procedures and processes;

• addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;

• consolidating the companies’ corporate, administrative and information technology infrastructure;

• coordinating sales, service delivery and marketing efforts;

• managing the movement of certain businesses and positions to different locations; and

• maintaining existing agreements with customers and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with
prospective customers and vendors.

In addition, at times, the attention of certain members of each company’s management and resources may be focused on
completion of the mergers and the integration of the businesses of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business
operations, which may disrupt each company’s ongoing business and the business of the combined company.

SYNNEX and Convergys may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in
light of the mergers.

Uncertainty about the effect of the mergers on SYNNEX and Convergys employees may have an adverse effect on each of
SYNNEX and Convergys separately and consequently the combined business. This uncertainty may impair SYNNEX’ and/or
Convergys’ ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the mergers are complete. Employee retention may be
particularly challenging during the pendency of the mergers, as employees of SYNNEX and Convergys may experience uncertainty
about their future roles with the combined business. Furthermore, if key employees of SYNNEX or Convergys depart or are at risk
of departing, including

TABLE OF CONTENTS

because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, financial security or a desire not to become employees of
the combined business, SYNNEX or Convergys may have to incur significant costs in retaining such individuals or in identifying,
hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees, and SYNNEX’ ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the mergers
may be adversely affected.

In order to complete the mergers, SYNNEX and Convergys must obtain certain governmental authorizations, and if such
authorizations are not granted, the mergers cannot be completed.

Completion of the mergers is conditioned upon the expiration or early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act
(such early termination was granted, effective on July 30, 2018), and completion of all other required antitrust filings, notices,
approvals and clearances. Although SYNNEX and Convergys have agreed in the merger agreement to use their reasonable best
efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make the required governmental filings and obtain the antitrust approvals, as the case may
be, there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting periods will expire or authorizations will be obtained, and if such
authorizations are not obtained, the mergers will not be completed. See “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion of the
Mergers” and “The Merger Agreement—Regulatory Approvals.”

In addition to receipt of certain governmental authorizations, completion of the mergers is subject to a number of other
conditions, and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the mergers will not be completed.

The obligations of SYNNEX and Convergys to complete the mergers are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of
conditions in addition to obtaining the antitrust approvals, including, among other conditions: (i) adoption of the merger agreement
by Convergys shareholders at the Convergys special meeting; (ii) approval of the stock issuance by SYNNEX stockholders at the
SYNNEX special meeting; and (iii) the absence of a material adverse effect on the other party (see “The Merger Agreement—
Definition of ‘Material Adverse Effect”’ for the definition of material adverse effect). For a more complete summary of the
conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to completion of the mergers, see “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to
Completion of the Mergers.” There can be no assurance that the conditions to completion of the mergers will be satisfied or waived
or that the mergers will be completed.

In addition, the SYNNEX special meeting and the Convergys special meeting may take place before the antitrust approvals
have been obtained and, therefore, before the terms on which the antitrust approvals may be obtained, or the conditions to obtaining
the antitrust approvals that may be imposed, are known. As a result, if SYNNEX stockholders approve the stock issuance at the
SYNNEX special meeting, or Convergys shareholders adopt the merger agreement at the Convergys special meeting, SYNNEX and
Convergys may make decisions after the respective meetings to waive a condition as to the receipt of the antitrust approvals or to
take certain actions required to obtain the antitrust approvals without seeking further shareholder or stockholder approval, as
applicable, and such actions could have an adverse effect on the combined company.

SYNNEX’ and Convergys’ business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the
mergers.

Parties that conduct business with SYNNEX or Convergys may experience uncertainty associated with the mergers, including
with respect to current or future business relationships with SYNNEX, Convergys or the combined business. SYNNEX’ and
Convergys’ business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes
in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than SYNNEX, Convergys or
the combined business. These disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of
operations or prospects of the combined business, including a material and adverse effect on SYNNEX’ ability to realize the
anticipated benefits of the mergers. The risk and adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of
the mergers or termination of the merger agreement.

Certain of Convergys’ executive officers and directors have interests in the mergers that may be different from your
interests as a shareholder of Convergys.

When considering the recommendation of Convergys’ board of directors that Convergys shareholders vote in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement, Convergys shareholders should be aware that certain of the executive officers and directors of
Convergys have interests in the mergers that may be different from, or in

TABLE OF CONTENTS

addition to, the interests of Convergys shareholders generally. These include treatment of unvested Convergys equity awards in
accordance with the merger agreement, in the case of executive officers only, potential severance benefits and rights to continuing
indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. See “Interests of Convergys’ Directors and Executive Officers in the
Mergers” for a more detailed description of these interests. Convergys’ board of directors and SYNNEX’ board of directors were
aware of these interests and considered them, among other things, in evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement and the
mergers and in recommending that Convergys shareholders adopt the merger agreement and that the SYNNEX stockholders
approve the stock issuance, respectively.

The merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Convergys to pursue alternatives to the mergers.

The merger agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for Convergys to sell its business to a party other than
SYNNEX. These provisions include a general prohibition on Convergys from soliciting any acquisition proposal. Further, there are
only limited exceptions to Convergys’ agreement that its board of directors will not change, withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to SYNNEX the recommendation of its board of directors in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and SYNNEX
generally has a right to match any acquisition proposal that may be made. However, at any time prior to the adoption of the merger
agreement by Convergys shareholders, Convergys’ board of directors is permitted to take certain of these actions if it determines in
good faith that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law. See “The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation” and “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses.”

The parties believe these provisions are reasonable and not preclusive of other offers, but these restrictions might discourage a
third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Convergys from considering or proposing that acquisition,
even if that party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value per Convergys common share than the currently proposed
merger consideration. Furthermore, the termination and expense reimbursement fees described below may result in a potential
competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price per Convergys common share to acquire Convergys than it might otherwise have
proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable by Convergys in certain
circumstances.

There can be no assurances that Convergys shareholders will not be required to recognize gain for U.S. federal income tax
purposes upon the exchange of Convergys common shares for shares of SYNNEX common stock and cash in the initial
merger.

Although SYNNEX and Convergys have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to cause the initial merger, together with the
subsequent merger, to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, there can be no assurance that
the mergers will so qualify. In addition, the completion of the mergers is not conditioned on the mergers qualifying for the intended
tax treatment or on the receipt of an opinion of counsel or IRS ruling to that effect, and whether or not the mergers will qualify for
the intended tax treatment depends on facts that will not be known until the mergers are completed. In particular, the intended tax
treatment requires that the value of the shares of SYNNEX common stock issued to Convergys shareholders in the initial merger,
determined as of the completion of the initial merger, represents at least a minimum percentage of the total consideration paid to
Convergys shareholders in the initial merger. While there is no specific guidance as to precisely what minimum percentage is
necessary to satisfy this requirement, it would be satisfied if the shares of SYNNEX common stock (valued as of completion of the
initial merger) represents at least 40% of the total merger consideration. Because this test is based on the value of the shares of
SYNNEX common stock as of completion of the initial merger, a decline in the value of the SYNNEX common stock could cause
this requirement not to be met. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the mergers will qualify for the intended tax treatment.

You should read the section “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of
the Stock Issuance—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” and consult your own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the transaction to you in your particular circumstances.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Failure to complete the mergers could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of
SYNNEX and Convergys.

If the mergers are not completed for any reason, including as a result of Convergys shareholders failing to adopt the merger
agreement or SYNNEX stockholders failing to approve the stock issuance, the ongoing businesses of SYNNEX and Convergys may
be materially and adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the mergers, SYNNEX and
Convergys would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:

• SYNNEX and Convergys may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on
their respective stock prices, and from their respective customers, vendors and employees;

• Convergys may be required to pay SYNNEX a termination fee of $74.0 million (or $37.0 million, in certain
circumstances) if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances or an expense reimbursement fee of
$12.35 million if Convergys shareholders fail to approve and adopt the merger agreement, and SYNNEX may be required
to pay Convergys an expense reimbursement fee of $12.35 million if the SYNNEX stockholders fail to approve the stock
issuance (see “The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees and Expenses”);

• SYNNEX and Convergys will be required to pay certain transaction expenses and other costs incurred in connection with
the mergers, whether or not the mergers are completed;

• the merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of Convergys’ and SYNNEX’ businesses prior to
completion of the mergers (see “The Merger Agreement—Conduct of Business Pending the Mergers” for a description of
the restrictive covenants applicable to Convergys and SYNNEX); and

• matters relating to the mergers (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources
by SYNNEX’ and Convergys’ management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other
opportunities that may have been beneficial to either SYNNEX or Convergys as an independent company.

There can be no assurance that the risks described above will not materialize. If any of those risks materialize, they may
materially and adversely affect SYNNEX’ and/or Convergys’ businesses, financial condition, financial results and/or stock prices.

The shares of SYNNEX common stock to be received by Convergys shareholders upon completion of the mergers will have
different rights from Convergys common shares.

Upon completion of the mergers, Convergys shareholders will no longer be shareholders of Convergys, an Ohio corporation,
but will instead become stockholders of SYNNEX, a Delaware corporation, and their rights as SYNNEX stockholders will be
governed by Delaware law and the terms of SYNNEX’ restated certificate of incorporation, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as SYNNEX’ charter, and SYNNEX’ amended and restated bylaws, which are referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as SYNNEX’ bylaws. Delaware law and the terms of SYNNEX’ charter and SYNNEX’ bylaws are in some
respects materially different than Ohio law and the terms of Convergys’ amended articles of incorporation, which are referred to in
this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Convergys’ articles, and Convergys’ amended and restated code of regulations, which are
referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Convergys’ code, which currently govern the rights of Convergys
shareholders. See “Comparison of Stockholder Rights” for a discussion of the different rights associated with Convergys common
shares and SYNNEX common stock.

Current SYNNEX stockholders and Convergys shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the
mergers and will exercise less influence over the management of the combined company.

Upon the completion of the mergers, SYNNEX expects to issue up to approximately 11,277,434 shares of SYNNEX common
stock to Convergys shareholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and up to approximately
801,000 shares of its common stock which may be issued upon conversion of the convertible debentures. As a result, it is expected
that, immediately after completion of the mergers, former Convergys shareholders will own approximately 22% of the outstanding
shares of SYNNEX

common stock excluding the potential issuance of shares upon conversion of the convertible debentures. Consequently, current
SYNNEX stockholders in the aggregate will have less influence over the management and policies of SYNNEX than they currently
have over the management and policies of SYNNEX, and Convergys shareholders in the aggregate will have less influence over the
management and policies of SYNNEX than they currently have over the management and policies of Convergys.

SYNNEX and Convergys may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits relating to the mergers, which
could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the mergers from being completed.

Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger
agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert
management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on
SYNNEX’ or Convergys’ liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction
prohibiting consummation of the mergers, then that injunction may delay or prevent the mergers from being completed. Currently,
SYNNEX and Convergys are not aware of any securities class action lawsuits or derivative lawsuits being filed in connection with
the mergers.

The proposed acquisition of Convergys and the incurrence of debt to fund the proposed acquisition of Convergys may
impact SYNNEX’ financial position and subject SYNNEX to additional financial and operating restrictions.

As of May 31, 2018, SYNNEX had $1.8 billion of total debt. SYNNEX expects to incur a substantial amount of additional
debt in connection with the proposed acquisition of Convergys. SYNNEX expects that upon completion of the proposed acquisition
of Convergys and the related financing transactions, SYNNEX’ total debt will increase to approximately $3.6 billion. If SYNNEX is
unable to raise financing on acceptable terms, SYNNEX may need to rely on the bridge facility, which may result in higher
borrowing costs and a shorter maturity than those from other anticipated financing alternatives. In addition, if SYNNEX is unable to
obtain long term debt financing on the terms it anticipates, then such alternative long term debt financing may subject SYNNEX to
additional financial and operating covenants, which may limit its flexibility in responding to its business needs. SYNNEX expects to
obtain long term secured debt financing in lieu of all or a portion of the commitment provided under tranche A of the bridge facility.
However, there can be no assurance SYNNEX will be able to obtain such permanent debt financing.

The mergers will allow holders of the Convergys’ outstanding convertible debentures to convert their debentures at a
temporarily increased conversion rate.

Under the terms of the convertible debentures, the mergers will constitute a fundamental change and a make-whole
fundamental change. As a result, holders of the convertible debentures will be permitted to choose (i) to convert their convertible
debentures at a temporarily increased conversion rate, (ii) to require Convergys to buy back their convertible debentures for a price
equal to their principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest to but excluding the repurchase date, or (iii) to continue holding
their convertible debentures. If the closing of the mergers occurs, the holders of the convertible debentures are expected to exercise
the right to convert their debentures in accordance with their terms at a temporarily increased conversion rate shortly following the
closing of the mergers (although the holders’ actual decisions will depend upon their judgments based on the prevailing market
conditions). Upon conversion following the closing of the mergers, the convertible debentures would be convertible into either cash
or a combination of cash and shares of SYNNEX common stock, at the election of Merger Sub II, as successor to Convergys, which
would then be a subsidiary of SYNNEX. As of June 30, 2018, $125.0 million of aggregate principal amount of the convertible
debentures were outstanding. For further information concerning the convertible debentures, including the calculation of amounts
payable upon conversion, see “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the
Stock Issuance—Ownership of SYNNEX Common Stock After the Mergers.”

The need to pay cash amounts owing on conversion of, or in respect of any demands for repurchase of, the convertible
debentures in connection with the mergers, and to issue SYNNEX common stock upon conversion, should SYNNEX elect to settle
conversions with a combination of cash and shares of SYNNEX common stock, may have an adverse effect on the value of
SYNNEX common stock. Furthermore, the delivery of conversion

TABLE OF CONTENTS

notices by holders of the convertible debentures prior to the closing of the mergers will require Convergys to settle such conversions
regardless of whether or not the closing of the mergers occurs. As a result, if the mergers do not close, Convergys would still be
required to pay in cash the principal amount of the convertible debentures surrendered for conversion, and deliver cash, Convergys
common shares or a combination of cash and shares with respect to the excess thereof. Such requirement could have a material
adverse effect on Convergys’ financial condition and liquidity.

SYNNEX and Convergys will incur significant transaction and integration-related costs in connection with the mergers, and
any such costs could adversely affect SYNNEX’ ability to execute on its integration plan.

SYNNEX expects to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the mergers and combining the operations of the
two companies. Additionally, each of SYNNEX and Convergys will incur significant transaction costs related to the mergers, which
must be paid even If the mergers are not completed. These costs are substantial and include financial advisory, legal and accounting
costs. SYNNEX also will incur significant integration-related fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration
plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. SYNNEX continues to assess the
magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the mergers and the integration of the two
companies’ businesses. Although SYNNEX expects that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other
efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow SYNNEX to offset integration-related costs over time, this net
benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.

The mergers may not be accretive, and may be dilutive, to SYNNEX’ operating earnings per share, which may negatively
affect the market price of shares of SYNNEX common stock.

SYNNEX currently projects that the mergers will be accretive to adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share during the first
12 months after close. This projection is based on preliminary estimates that may materially change. In addition, future events and
conditions could decrease or delay the accretion that is currently projected or could result in dilution, including adverse changes in
market conditions, additional transaction and integration-related costs and other factors such as the failure to realize some or all of
the anticipated benefits of the mergers. Any dilution of, decrease in or delay of any accretion to, SYNNEX’ non-GAAP diluted
earnings per share could cause the price of shares of SYNNEX common stock to decline or grow at a reduced rate.

The opinions obtained by each of Convergys’ and SYNNEX’ board of directors from their respective financial advisors do
not reflect changes in circumstances subsequent to the respective dates of such opinions.

Consistent with market practice, Convergys’ board of directors has not obtained, and does not intend to obtain, an updated
opinion from its financial advisor, and SYNNEX’ board of directors has not obtained, and does not intend to obtain, an updated
opinion from its financial advisor. The respective opinions received by Convergys’ board of directors and SYNNEX’ board of
directors prior to the execution of the merger agreement do not speak to the time when the mergers will be completed or to any date
other than the date of such opinion. As a result, the respective opinions do not address the fairness, from a financial point of view, as
of the time the mergers are completed, to holders of Convergys common shares of the merger consideration to be received by such
holders pursuant to the merger agreement, or the fairness, from a financial point of view, to SYNNEX of the merger consideration to
be paid by SYNNEX pursuant to the merger agreement. For descriptions of the respective opinions rendered by each of Centerview
and BofA Merrill Lynch, see “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the
Stock Issuance—Opinion of Convergys’ Financial Advisor” and “—Opinion of SYNNEX’ Financial Advisor” and the full text of

reasons. Specifically, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not reflect the effect of any potential
divestitures that may occur prior to or subsequent to the completion of the mergers or SYNNEX’ projected reduction of its debt to

Risks relating to SYNNEX and Convergys.

SYNNEX and Convergys are, and following the completion of the mergers, SYNNEX will continue to be, subject to the risks
described in (i) Part I, Item 1A in SYNNEX’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2017, and filed with

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

SYNNEX and Convergys have included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus certain statements that may constitute
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 related to SYNNEX, Convergys and the proposed acquisition of Convergys by SYNNEX. All statements
other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements for purposes of federal and state securities laws. These
forward-looking statements involve uncertainties that could significantly affect the financial or operating results of Convergys,
SYNNEX or the combined company. These forward-looking statements may be identified by terms such as anticipate, believe,
foresee, expect, intend, plan, may, will, could and should and the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. Forward-
looking statements in this document include, among other things, statements about the potential benefits of the proposed acquisition,
including future financial and operating results, plans, objectives, expectations and intentions; the anticipated timing of closing of
the acquisition; treatment of the convertible debentures and SYNNEX’ assumptions with respect to the maximum number of shares
of SYNNEX common stock that may be issuable in connection with the conversion of the convertible debentures; and the methods
SYNNEX will use to finance the cash portion of the transaction. In addition, all statements that address operating performance,
events or developments that SYNNEX or Convergys expects or anticipates will occur in the future—including statements relating to
creating value for stockholders, benefits of the proposed transactions to customers, vendors, employees, stockholders and other
constituents of the combined company, integrating the two companies, cost savings and the expected timetable for completing the
proposed transaction—are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Risks and uncertainties
include, among other things, risks related to the satisfaction of the conditions to closing the acquisition (including the failure to
obtain necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals) in the anticipated timeframe or at all; risks related to the ability to realize the
anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including the possibility that the expected benefits from the proposed acquisition will not be
realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully;
disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain business, contractual and operational relationships; the
unfavorable outcome of any legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against SYNNEX, Convergys or the combined
company; failure to protect proprietary or personally identifiable data against unauthorized access or unintended release; the ability
to retain key personnel; negative effects of this announcement or the consummation of the proposed acquisition on the market price
of the capital stock of SYNNEX and Convergys, and on SYNNEX’ and Convergys’ operating results; significant transaction costs,
fees, expenses and charges; unknown liabilities; the risk of litigation and/or regulatory actions related to the proposed acquisition;
the financing of the transaction; other business effects, including the effects of industry, market, economic, political or regulatory
conditions; future exchange and interest rates; changes in tax and other laws, regulations, rates and policies; future business
combinations or disposals; and competitive developments.

In addition to the risks described under “Risk Factors” and those risks described in any documents that are incorporated by
reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the following factors, among others, could cause actual future results and other
future events to differ materially from those currently estimated by management, including, but not limited to:

• the timing to complete the mergers;

• the risk that a condition to completion of the mergers may not be satisfied;

• the risk that a regulatory approval that may be required for the mergers is delayed, is not obtained or is obtained subject to
conditions that are not anticipated;

• SYNNEX’ ability to achieve the synergies and value creation projected to be realized following the completion of the
mergers;

• SYNNEX’ ability to promptly and effectively integrate Convergys’ businesses;

• the diversion of management time on merger-related issues;

• risks related to any legal proceedings that may be instituted against SYNNEX, Convergys and others relating to the
mergers;

• the risk that the mergers do not qualify for the intended tax treatment;

SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS OF SYNNEX

SYNNEX is providing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to its stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies
to be voted at the SYNNEX special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement of the SYNNEX special meeting) that
SYNNEX has called to consider and vote on a proposal to approve the stock issuance and a proposal to adjourn the
SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient proxies to approve the stock
issuance at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting.

Date, Time and Location

Together with this joint proxy statement/prospectus, SYNNEX is also sending SYNNEX stockholders a notice of the
SYNNEX special meeting and a form of proxy card that is solicited by SYNNEX’ board of directors for use at the SYNNEX special
meeting to be held on October 3, 2018, at its offices at 44201 Nobel Drive, Fremont, California 94538, at 10:00 a.m. (Pacific Time),
and any adjournments or postponements of the SYNNEX special meeting.

Only stockholders or their proxy holders may attend the SYNNEX special meeting. If you hold shares in your name at the
record date (the close of business on August 31, 2018) and plan to attend the SYNNEX special meeting, you will be required to
provide valid government-issued photo identification (e.g., a driver’s license or a passport) to be admitted to the SYNNEX special
meeting.

If you are a beneficial owner of shares of SYNNEX common stock held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee
holder of record at the record date (the close of business on August 31, 2018), and you plan to attend the SYNNEX special meeting,
in addition to following the security procedures described above, you will also need proof of beneficial ownership at the record date.
A brokerage statement or letter from a bank or broker are examples of proof of beneficial ownership. If you wish to vote your shares
of SYNNEX common stock held in “street name” in person at the SYNNEX special meeting, you will have to obtain a written legal
proxy in your name from the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record that holds your shares.

Purpose

At the SYNNEX special meeting, SYNNEX stockholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:

• to approve the stock issuance; and

• to approve the adjournment of the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes to approve the stock issuance at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting, or any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

Under SYNNEX’ bylaws, the business to be conducted at the SYNNEX special meeting will be limited to the proposals set
forth in the notice to SYNNEX stockholders provided with this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Recommendations of the SYNNEX Board of Directors

SYNNEX’ board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement, including the stock issuance, are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of SYNNEX
stockholders. SYNNEX’ board of directors unanimously recommends that SYNNEX stockholders vote “FOR” the stock issuance.
SYNNEX’ board of directors further unanimously recommends that SYNNEX stockholders vote “FOR” the adjournment of the
SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the stock issuance at
the time of the SYNNEX special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof. See “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the
Merger Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the Stock Issuance—SYNNEX’ Reasons for the Merger;
Recommendations of SYNNEX’ Board of Directors that Stockholders Approve the Stock Issuance” for a more detailed discussion
of the recommendation of SYNNEX’ board of directors that SYNNEX stockholders approve the stock issuance.

SYNNEX Record Date; Outstanding Shares; Stockholders Entitled to Vote

SYNNEX’ board of directors has fixed the close of business on August 31, 2018, as the record date for determination of the
SYNNEX stockholders entitled to vote at the SYNNEX special meeting, or any adjournment

or postponement thereof. Only SYNNEX stockholders of record at the record date are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at,
the SYNNEX special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof. As of the close of business on August 23, 2018, the
most recent practicable date for which such information was available, there were 39,628,172 shares of SYNNEX common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote at the SYNNEX special meeting, held by approximately 677 holders of record. The number of
shares of SYNNEX common stock outstanding as of the record date is not expected to be meaningfully different from the number
on August 23, 2018.

Quorum

A quorum, which is a majority of the outstanding shares as of the record date, must be present to hold the SYNNEX special
meeting. A quorum is calculated based on the number of shares represented by the stockholders attending in person and by their
proxy holders. If you indicate an abstention as your voting preference, your shares will be counted toward a quorum but they will
not be voted on the matter.

Abstentions on any matters are treated as shares present or represented and entitled to vote on that matter and have the same
effect as a vote against such matter.

Shares of SYNNEX common stock held in “street name” with respect to which the beneficial owner fails to give voting
instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record on any of the proposals to be voted on at the SYNNEX special
meeting, and shares of SYNNEX common stock with respect to which the beneficial owner otherwise fails to vote, will not be
deemed present at the SYNNEX special meeting for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. Accordingly, SYNNEX
encourages you to provide voting instructions to your broker, whether or not you plan to attend the SYNNEX special meeting.

Approval of the stock issuance requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the SYNNEX special meeting
(assuming a quorum, as defined under Delaware law, is present). Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote
of a majority of the shares present at the SYNNEX special meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote (whether or not a
quorum, as defined under Delaware law, is present).

Required Vote

Assuming a quorum is present, approval of the stock issuance requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the
SYNNEX special meeting. SYNNEX cannot complete the mergers unless its stockholders approve the stock issuance. Under
the current rules and interpretive guidance of the NYSE, “votes cast” on the stock issuance consist of votes “for” or “against” as
well as abstentions. As a result, a SYNNEX stockholder’s abstention from voting on the stock issuance will have the same effect as
a vote “AGAINST” the proposal. The failure of a SYNNEX stockholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a
broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record or a
SYNNEX stockholder’s other failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of any vote to approve the stock issuance because
these failures to vote are not considered “votes cast.”

Approval of the adjournment of the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes to approve the stock issuance at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting, whether or not a quorum, as defined
under Delaware law, is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present at the SYNNEX special meeting in
person or by proxy and entitled to vote. A SYNNEX stockholder’s abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal, but the failure of a SYNNEX stockholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker,
bank or other nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record or a
SYNNEX stockholder’s other failure to vote will have no effect on the approval of the proposal.

Share Ownership of and Voting by SYNNEX Directors and Executive Officers

At the close of business on August 23, 2018, the most recent practicable date for which such information was available,
SYNNEX’ directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned and had the right to vote in the aggregate
9,787,431 shares of SYNNEX common stock, which represents approximately 24.7% of the SYNNEX common stock entitled to
vote as of that date.

It is expected that SYNNEX’ directors and executive officers and their affiliates will vote their shares “FOR” the stock
issuance and “FOR” the adjournment of the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit

additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the stock issuance at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting,
although none of them has entered into any agreement requiring them to do so.

Voting of Shares

Via the Internet or by Telephone

If you hold shares of SYNNEX common stock directly in your name as a stockholder of record, you may vote via the Internet
at www.AALvote.com/SNXSM or by telephone by calling 1 (866) 804-9616 toll-free. In order to vote your shares via the Internet
or by telephone, you will need the control number on your proxy card (which is unique to each SYNNEX stockholder to ensure all
voting instructions are genuine and to prevent duplicate voting). Votes may be submitted via the Internet or by telephone, 24 hours a
day, seven days a week, and must be received by 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on October 2, 2018.

If you hold shares of SYNNEX common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, you
may provide voting instructions via the Internet or by telephone only if Internet or telephone voting is made available by your
broker, bank or other nominee holder of record. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or other
nominee holder of record with these materials.

By Mail

If you hold shares of SYNNEX common stock directly in your name as a stockholder of record, in order to vote by mail, you
may submit a proxy card. You will need to complete, sign and date your proxy card and return it using the postage-paid return
envelope provided. Your proxy card must be received no later than the close of business on October 2, 2018.

If you hold shares of SYNNEX common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, in
order to provide voting instructions by mail you will need to complete, sign and date the voting instruction form provided by your
broker, bank or other nominee holder of record and return it in the postage-paid return envelope provided. Your broker, bank or
other nominee holder of record must receive your voting instruction form in sufficient time to vote your shares.

In Person

If you hold shares of SYNNEX common stock directly in your name as a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the
SYNNEX special meeting.

When a stockholder of record submits a proxy via the Internet or by telephone, his or her proxy is recorded immediately. You
are encouraged to register your vote via the Internet or telephone whenever possible. If you submit a proxy via the Internet or by
telephone, please do not return your proxy card by mail. If you attend the meeting, you may also vote in person. Any votes that you
previously submitted—whether via the Internet, by telephone or by mail—will be revoked and superseded by any vote that you cast
at the SYNNEX special meeting. Your attendance at the SYNNEX special meeting alone will not revoke any proxy previously
given.

If you hold shares of SYNNEX common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, you
must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the bank or broker to be able to vote in person at the SYNNEX special meeting.
To request a proxy, please contact your broker, bank or other nominee holder of record.

Whether you vote via the Internet or telephone, by mail or in person, if your shares are held in an account at a broker, bank or
other nominee holder of record (i.e., in “street name”), you must instruct the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record on how
to vote your shares. Your broker, bank or other nominee holder of record will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on
how to vote by filling out the voting instruction form sent to you by your broker, bank or other nominee holder of record with this
joint proxy statement/prospectus. Brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record who hold shares of SYNNEX common stock
in “street name” typically have the authority to vote in their discretion on “routine” proposals when they have not received
instructions on how to vote from the beneficial owner. However, brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record typically are
not allowed to exercise their voting discretion on matters that are “non-routine” without specific instructions on how to vote from
the beneficial owner. Under the current rules of the NYSE, both proposals to be considered at the SYNNEX special meeting as
described in this joint proxy

statement/prospectus are considered non-routine. Therefore brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record do not have
discretionary authority to vote on either proposal. A beneficial owner’s failure to instruct the broker, bank or other nominee holder
of record how to vote shares held in “street name” will have no effect on the approval of the proposal to approve the stock issuance
or the proposal to adjourn the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary.

All shares represented by each properly completed and valid proxy received before or at the SYNNEX special meeting will be
voted in accordance with the instructions given in the proxy. If a SYNNEX stockholder signs a proxy card and returns it without
giving instructions for the voting on any proposal, the SYNNEX common stock represented by that proxy card will be voted “FOR”
the stock issuance and “FOR” the adjournment of the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are
not sufficient votes to approve the stock issuance at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you expect to attend the SYNNEX
special meeting in person, please vote or otherwise submit a proxy to vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your
shares may be represented and voted at the SYNNEX special meeting. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker
or other nominee holder of record, please follow the instructions on the voting instruction form furnished to you by such
record holder.

Revocability of Proxies; Changing Your Vote

You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before the closing of the polls at the SYNNEX special meeting. If
you are a stockholder of record at the record date (the close of business on August 31, 2018), you can revoke your proxy or change
your vote by:

• sending a signed notice stating that you revoke your proxy to Alliance Advisors at 200 Broadacres Drive, 3rd Fl.,
Bloomfield, NJ 07003, that bears a date later than the date of proxy you want to revoke and is received before 11:59 pm
(Eastern Time) on October 2, 2018;

• submitting a valid, later-dated proxy via the Internet or telephone before 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on October 2, 2018, or
by mail that is received before 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on October 2, 2018; or

• attending the SYNNEX special meeting (or, if the SYNNEX special meeting is adjourned or postponed, attending the
adjourned or postponed meeting) and voting in person, which automatically will cancel any proxy previously given, or
revoking your proxy in person, but your attendance at the SYNNEX special meeting alone will not revoke any proxy
previously given.

If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, you must contact your
broker, bank or other nominee holder of record to change your vote or obtain a written legal proxy to vote your shares if you wish to
cast your vote in person at the SYNNEX special meeting.

Solicitation of Proxies; Expenses of Solicitation

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being provided to holders of shares of SYNNEX common stock in connection with the
solicitation of proxies by SYNNEX’ board of directors to be voted at the SYNNEX special meeting and at any adjournments or
postponements of the SYNNEX special meeting. SYNNEX will bear all costs and expenses in connection with the solicitation of
proxies, including the costs of filing, printing and mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus for the SYNNEX special meeting.

In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers and employees of SYNNEX or its subsidiaries may solicit proxies from
stockholders by telephone, telegram, email, personal interview or other means. SYNNEX currently expects not to incur any costs
beyond those customarily expended for a solicitation of proxies in connection with approval of an issuance of common shares.
Directors, officers and employees of SYNNEX will not receive additional compensation for their solicitation activities, but may be
reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with the solicitation. Brokers, dealers,
commercial banks, trust companies, fiduciaries, custodians and other nominees have been requested to forward proxy solicitation
materials to their customers, and such nominees will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Householding

Unless SYNNEX has received contrary instructions, SYNNEX may send a single copy of this joint prospectus/proxy statement
and notice to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if SYNNEX

believes the stockholders are members of the same family. Each stockholder in the household will continue to receive a separate
proxy card. This process, known as “householding,” reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household and
helps to reduce SYNNEX’ expenses.

Adjournment

SYNNEX stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give SYNNEX’ board of directors authority to adjourn
the SYNNEX special meeting one or more times for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the approval of the stock
issuance if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting to approve the stock issuance. If this proposal
is approved, the SYNNEX special meeting could be adjourned to any date. In addition, SYNNEX’ board of directors, with or
without shareholder approval, could postpone the meeting before it commences, whether for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies or for other reasons. If the SYNNEX special meeting is adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies,
stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their use. If you sign and
return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal, or if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the
approval of the stock issuance but do not indicate a choice on the adjournment proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of the
adjournment proposal. But if you indicate that you wish to vote against the approval of the stock issuance, your shares will only be
voted in favor of the adjournment proposal if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of that proposal.

Other Information

The matters to be considered at the SYNNEX special meeting are of great importance to the stockholders of SYNNEX.
Accordingly, you are urged to read and carefully consider the information contained in or incorporated by reference into this joint
proxy statement/prospectus and submit your proxy via the Internet or by telephone or complete, date, sign and promptly return the
enclosed proxy card in the enclosed postage-paid envelope. If you submit your proxy via the Internet or by telephone, you do
not need to return the enclosed proxy card.

SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS OF CONVERGYS

Convergys is providing this joint proxy statement/prospectus to its shareholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies
to be voted at the Convergys special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement of the Convergys special meeting) that
Convergys has called to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the merger agreement, a proposal to adjourn from time to
time the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the
merger agreement at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof and a proposal
to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its
named executive officers in connection with the mergers.

Date, Time and Location

Together with this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Convergys is also sending Convergys shareholders a notice of the
Convergys special meeting and a form of proxy card that is solicited by Convergys’ board of directors for use at the Convergys
special meeting to be held on October 3, 2018, at the Atrium One Building, 201 East Fourth Street, Suite 350, Cincinnati, Ohio
45202, and any adjournments or postponements of the Convergys special meeting.

Only shareholders or their proxy holders may attend the Convergys special meeting. If you hold shares in your name at the
record date (the close of business on August 31, 2018) and plan to attend the Convergys special meeting, please be prepared to
provide valid government-issued photo identification (e.g., a driver’s license or a passport) to be admitted.

If you are a beneficial owner of Convergys common shares held in “street name” by a broker, bank or other nominee holder of
record at the record date (the close of business on August 31, 2018), in addition to proper identification, you will also need proof of
beneficial ownership at the record date to be admitted to the Convergys special meeting. A brokerage statement or letter from a bank
or broker are examples of proof of beneficial ownership. If you want to vote your Convergys common shares held in “street name”
in person at the Convergys special meeting, you will have to obtain a written legal proxy in your name from the broker, bank or
other nominee holder of record who holds your shares.

Purpose

At the Convergys special meeting, Convergys shareholders will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:

• to adopt the merger agreement;

• to approve the adjournment from time to time of the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if
there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof; and

• to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its
named executive officers in connection with the mergers.

Convergys has not received notice of any other proposals to be presented at the Convergys special meeting.

Recommendations of the Convergys Board of Directors

Convergys’ board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the mergers, and the other transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement are advisable, fair and in the best interests of Convergys and its shareholders, declared it
advisable to enter into the merger agreement and approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
including the mergers. Convergys’ board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to adopt the
merger agreement. Convergys’ board of directors further unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the proposal to approve
the adjournment from time to time of the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, and “FOR” the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may be paid or provided
by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers. See “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger

Shareholders Adopt the Merger Agreement” for a more detailed discussion of the recommendation of the Convergys board of
directors that Convergys shareholders adopt the merger agreement.

Convergys Record Date; Outstanding Shares; Shareholders Entitled to Vote

Convergys’ board of directors has fixed the close of business on August 31, 2018, as the record date for determination of
Convergys shareholders entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement of the Convergys special meeting. As of the close of business on August 23, 2018, the most recent practicable date
for which such information was available, there were 91,155,277 Convergys common shares outstanding and entitled to vote at the
Convergys special meeting, held by approximately 6,025 holders of record. The number of Convergys common shares outstanding
as of the record date is not expected to be meaningfully different from the number on August 23, 2018.

Quorum

A quorum of shareholders at the Convergys special meeting is required for Convergys shareholders to adopt the merger
agreement or approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its
named executive officers in connection with the mergers. The presence at the Convergys special meeting, in person or by proxy, of
the holders of record of a majority of the Convergys common shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote will be necessary
and sufficient to constitute a quorum at the Convergys special meeting. Shares held by shareholders who abstain from voting will be
included as shares present at the Convergys special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. Convergys common shares held
in “street name” with respect to which the beneficial owner fails to give voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee
holder of record and Convergys common shares with respect to which the beneficial owner fails to vote will not be deemed present
at the Convergys special meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the
Convergys special meeting. Failure of a quorum to be present at the Convergys special meeting will necessitate an adjournment or
postponement thereof.

Required Vote

Pursuant to the OGCL, the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding Convergys common shares
entitled to vote thereon is required to adopt the merger agreement. Accordingly, a Convergys shareholder’s abstention from
voting, the failure of a Convergys shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other
nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other nominee holder of record or a Convergys
shareholder’s other failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger
agreement.

To approve the adjournment from time to time of the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if
there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof (whether or not a quorum is present) requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
Convergys common shares present or represented by proxy at the Convergys special meeting. Accordingly, a Convergys
shareholder’s abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the vote to adjourn the Convergys special
meeting, but the failure of a Convergys shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other
nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other holder of record or a Convergys shareholder’s
other failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of any vote to adjourn the Convergys special meeting.

To approve the non-binding advisory proposal to approve compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to
its named executive officers in connection with the mergers requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
Convergys common shares present or represented by proxy at the Convergys special meeting. Accordingly, a Convergys
shareholder’s abstention from voting will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the vote to adjourn the Convergys special
meeting, but the failure of a Convergys shareholder who holds his or her shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other
nominee holder of record to give voting instructions to that broker, bank or other holder of record or a Convergys shareholder’s
other failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of any vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation
that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Stock Ownership of and Voting by Convergys Directors and Executive Officers

At the close of business on August 23, 2018, the most recent practicable date for which such information was available,
Convergys’ directors and executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned and had the right to vote in the aggregate
1,082,104 Convergys common shares, which represent 1.2% of the Convergys common shares entitled to vote as of that date.

Each of the directors and certain executive officers of Convergys, solely in his or her individual capacity as a Convergys
shareholder, has entered into a voting agreement with SYNNEX to vote all of the Convergys common shares eligible to be voted at
the Convergys special meeting by them in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and in favor of the proposal to adjourn the
Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at
the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. For more information, see “The Voting
Agreement.” As of August 23, 2018, neither SYNNEX nor any of its subsidiaries, directors or executive officers owned any
Convergys common shares.

Voting of Shares

If you hold Convergys common shares directly in your name as a shareholder of record, you may submit a proxy to vote via the
Internet at www.proxyvote.com or by telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903 toll-free. In order to submit a proxy to vote via the

telephone 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and must be received by 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on October 2, 2018.

If you hold Convergys common shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, you may
provide voting instructions via the Internet or by telephone only if Internet or telephone voting is made available by your broker,
bank or other nominee holder of record. Please follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee holder
of record with these materials.

If you hold Convergys common shares directly in your name as a shareholder of record, you may submit a proxy card to vote
by mail. You will need to complete, sign and date your proxy card and return it using the postage-paid return envelope provided or
return it to Broadridge. Broadridge must receive your proxy card no later than the close of business on October 2, 2018.

If you hold Convergys common shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, in order to
provide voting instructions by mail, you will need to complete, sign and date the voting instruction form provided by your broker,
bank or other nominee holder of record and return it in the postage-paid return envelope provided. Your broker, bank or other
nominee holder of record must receive your voting instruction form in sufficient time to vote your shares.

In Person

If you hold Convergys common shares directly in your name as a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the
Convergys special meeting. Shareholders of record also may be represented by another person at the Convergys special meeting by
executing a proper proxy designating that person.

When a shareholder of record submits a proxy via the Internet or by telephone, his or her proxy is recorded immediately. You
are encouraged to register your proxy via the Internet or telephone whenever possible. If you submit a proxy via the Internet or by
telephone, please do not return your proxy card by mail. If you attend the meeting, you may also vote in person. Any proxies that
you previously submitted—whether via the Internet, by telephone or by mail—will be superseded by any vote that you cast at the
Convergys special meeting.

If you hold Convergys common shares in “street name” through a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, you must
obtain a written legal proxy from that institution and present it to the inspector of elections with your ballot to be able to vote in
person at the Convergys special meeting. To request a legal proxy, please contact your broker, bank or other nominee holder of
record.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

If your shares are held in an account at a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record (i.e., in “street name”), you must
instruct the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record on how to vote your shares. Your broker, bank or other nominee holder
of record will vote your shares only if you provide instructions on how to vote by filling out the voting instruction form sent to you
by your broker, bank or other nominee holder of record with this joint proxy statement/prospectus. Brokers, banks and other
nominee holders of record who hold Convergys common shares in “street name” typically have the authority to vote in their
discretion on “routine” proposals when they have not received instructions on how to vote from the beneficial owner. However,
brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record typically are not allowed to exercise their voting discretion on matters that are
“non-routine” without specific instructions on how to vote from the beneficial owner. Under the current rules of the NYSE, each of
the three proposals to be considered at the Convergys special meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is
considered non-routine. Therefore, brokers, banks and other nominee holders of record do not have discretionary authority to vote
on any of the three proposals. A beneficial owner’s failure to instruct the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record how to vote
shares held in “street name” will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the adoption of the merger agreement. A beneficial
owner’s failure to instruct the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record how to vote shares held in “street name” will have no
effect on the proposal to adjourn from time to time the Convergys special meeting (assuming a quorum is present), if necessary, or
the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its
named executive officers in connection with the mergers.

Broker non-votes are shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee holder of record where the broker, bank or other nominee
holder is present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting, but with respect to which the broker, bank or other
nominee holder of record is not instructed by the beneficial owner of such shares on how to vote on a particular proposal and the
broker, bank or other nominee holder of record does not have discretionary voting power on such proposal. Because brokers, banks
and other nominee holders of record do not have discretionary voting authority with respect to any of the three proposals described
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, if a beneficial owner of Convergys common shares held in “street name” does not give
voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee holder of record, then those shares will not be present in person or
represented by proxy at the Convergys special meeting. As a result, there will not be any broker non-votes in connection with any of
the three proposals to be considered at the Convergys special meeting as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

All shares represented by each properly completed and valid proxy received before or at the Convergys special meeting will be
voted in accordance with the instructions given in the proxy. If a Convergys shareholder signs a proxy card and returns it without
giving instructions for the voting on any proposal, the Convergys common shares represented by that proxy card will be voted
“FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement, “FOR” the proposal to approve the adjournment of the Convergys special meeting, if
necessary, and “FOR” the proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may be paid or
provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers. Convergys shareholders should NOT send
share certificates with their proxy cards.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you expect to attend the
Convergys special meeting in person, please submit a proxy to vote your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares
may be represented and voted at the Convergys special meeting. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or
other nominee holder of record, please follow the instructions on the voting instruction form furnished to you by such record
holder.

Revocability of Proxies; Changing Your Vote

You may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before the closing of the polls at the Convergys special meeting. If
you are a shareholder of record at the record date (the close of business on August 31, 2018), you can revoke your proxy or change
your vote by:

• sending a signed notice stating that you revoke your proxy to Broadridge that bears a date later than the date of the proxy

Solicitation of Proxies; Expenses of Solicitation

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being provided to holders of Convergys common shares in connection with the
solicitation of proxies by Convergys’ board of directors to be voted at the Convergys special meeting and at any adjournments or
postponements of the Convergys special meeting. Convergys will bear all costs and expenses in connection with the solicitation of
proxies, including the costs of filing, printing and mailing this joint proxy statement/prospectus for the Convergys special meeting.
Convergys has engaged Innisfree to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Convergys special meeting and will pay Innisfree a
fee of approximately $30,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

In addition to solicitation by mail, directors, officers and employees of Convergys or its subsidiaries may solicit proxies from
shareholders by telephone, telegram, e-mail, personal interview or other means. Convergys currently expects not to incur any costs
beyond those customarily expended for a solicitation of proxies in connection with the adoption of the merger agreement. Directors,
officers and employees of Convergys will not receive additional compensation for their solicitation activities, but may be
reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with the solicitation. Brokers, dealers,
commercial banks, trust companies, fiduciaries, custodians and other nominees have been requested to forward proxy solicitation
materials to their customers, and such nominees will be reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Householding

The SEC has adopted a rule concerning the delivery of proxy materials. It permits Convergys, with your permission, to send a
single copy of this joint proxy statement/prospectus to any household at which two or more shareholders reside if Convergys
believes they are members of the same family. This rule is called “householding,” and its purpose is to help reduce printing and
mailing costs of proxy materials. Convergys has instituted this practice, but you may nonetheless receive a separate mailing if you
hold additional shares in a brokerage account. If you are a Convergys shareholder who resides in the same household with another
shareholder with the same last name, or if you hold more than one account with Broadridge registered in your name at the same
address, and wish to receive a separate set of proxy materials for each account, please contact Broadridge via the Internet at
www.proxyvote.com, or by telephone by calling 1-800-579-1639 toll-free. You may revoke your consent to householding at any
time by contacting Broadridge using the contact information set forth above.

A number of brokerage firms have instituted householding for shares held in “street name.” If you and members of your
household have multiple accounts holding Convergys common shares, you may have received a householding notification from
your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have questions, require additional copies of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus or wish to revoke your decision to household. These options are available to you at any time.

Adjournment

Convergys shareholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give Convergys’ board of directors authority to adjourn
the Convergys special meeting from time to time if necessary for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies in favor of the adoption
of the merger agreement if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, to adopt the merger agreement. If this proposal is approved, the Convergys special meeting could be
adjourned to any date or dates.

In addition, Convergys’ board of directors, without prior shareholder approval, could postpone the meeting before it
commences, whether for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies or for other reasons. If the Convergys special meeting is
adjourned for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies, shareholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to
revoke them at any time prior to their use. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal,
or if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement but do not indicate a choice on the
adjournment proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal. But if you indicate that you wish to vote
against the adoption of the merger agreement, your shares will only be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal if you indicate
that you wish to vote in favor of that proposal.

CONVERGYS PROPOSAL I: ADOPTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT
AND

SYNNEX PROPOSAL I: APPROVAL OF THE STOCK ISSUANCE

General

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being provided to Convergys shareholders in connection with the solicitation of
proxies by Convergys’ board of directors to be voted at the Convergys special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements
of the Convergys special meeting. At the Convergys special meeting, Convergys will ask its shareholders to vote on (i) a proposal to
adopt the merger agreement, (ii) a proposal to adjourn from time to time the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit
additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof and (iii) a proposal to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or
may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers.

This joint proxy statement/prospectus is being provided to SYNNEX stockholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies
by SYNNEX’ board of directors to be voted at the SYNNEX special meeting and at any adjournments or postponements of the
SYNNEX special meeting. At the SYNNEX special meeting, SYNNEX will ask its stockholders to vote on (i) a proposal to approve
the stock issuance and (ii) a proposal to adjourn the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are
not sufficient proxies to approve the stock issuance at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting, or any adjournment or
postponement thereof.

The merger agreement provides for the initial merger of Merger Sub I with and into Convergys, with Convergys continuing as
the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX, and in the subsequent merger Convergys will be merged
with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II continuing as the surviving company and a wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX.
The mergers will not be completed and the merger consideration will not be paid unless Convergys shareholders adopt the
merger agreement and SYNNEX stockholders approve the stock issuance. A copy of the merger agreement is attached as
Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You are urged to read the merger agreement in its entirety because it is the legal
document that governs the mergers. For additional information about the mergers, see “The Merger Agreement—Structure of the
Mergers” and “The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration.”

Upon completion of the initial merger, each Convergys common share will be converted into the right to receive $13.25 in
cash, without interest, and a fraction of a share of SYNNEX common stock equal to the exchange ratio. Currently the exchange ratio
is 0.1193, but this exchange ratio may be adjusted at closing if the 20 day average trading price of SYNNEX common stock three
trading days prior to the closing of the mergers has increased or decreased by more than 10% from a base price of $111.0766. Under
the terms of the convertible debentures, the mergers will constitute a fundamental change and a make-whole fundamental change.
As a result, holders of the convertible debentures will be permitted to choose (i) to convert their convertible debentures at a
temporarily increased conversion rate, (ii) to require Convergys to buy back their convertible debentures for a price equal to their
principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest to but excluding the repurchase date, or (iii) to continue holding their convertible
debentures. If the closing of the mergers occurs, the holders of the convertible debentures are expected to exercise the right to
convert their debentures in accordance with their terms at a temporarily increased conversion rate shortly following the closing of
the mergers (although the holders’ actual decisions will depend upon their judgments based on the prevailing market conditions).
Upon conversion following the closing of the mergers, the convertible debentures would be convertible into either cash or a
combination of cash and shares of SYNNEX common stock, at the election of Merger Sub II, as successor to Convergys, which
would then be a subsidiary of SYNNEX. Accordingly, if Merger Sub II so elects, SYNNEX estimates that up to 801,000 shares of
SYNNEX common stock may be issued to holders of the convertible debentures, based on certain assumptions as to the closing date
of the mergers, the final merger consideration, the conversion rate for the convertible debentures and the market prices of Convergys
common shares and SYNNEX common stock, as described in “—Ownership of SYNNEX Common Stock After the Mergers.” As
of June 30, 2018, $125.0 million of aggregate principal amount of the convertible debentures were outstanding.

Background of the Mergers

Each of Convergys’ board of directors and SYNNEX’ board of directors, acting independently and with the advice of their
respective management teams, periodically and in the ordinary course of business, reviews and assesses the operations, financial
performance and industry conditions of Convergys and SYNNEX, respectively,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

in light of the current business and economic environment and in consideration of their respective long-term business strategies to
enhance value for their respective stockholders. From time to time, the boards of directors and management teams of Convergys and
SYNNEX have evaluated and considered a variety of potential financial and strategic options in light of industry developments and
changing economic and market conditions.

During the first half of 2017, Convergys’ board of directors and management continued to actively assess Convergys’ progress
in evolving its business in light of the foregoing and opportunities to accelerate Convergys’ business initiatives. In the course of this
assessment, Convergys’ board of directors discussed Convergys’ near- and long-term strategy and, as part of its ongoing strategic
planning, engaged a management consultant to conduct a strategic review of Convergys’ business.

In early 2017, Ms. Andrea J. Ayers, the chief executive officer of Convergys, and Mr. Andre Valentine, the chief financial
officer of Convergys, met with the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of an industry participant, which is referred to
in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Party A, and discussed industry trends and issues and the performance, business, strategic
direction and prospects of their respective companies, as well as the merits of combining their two companies. In the summer of
2017, Ms. Ayers again spoke with the chief executive officer of Party A regarding these topics.

Also in the summer of 2017, Ms. Ayers spoke by telephone with Mr. Kevin Murai, the then chief executive officer of
SYNNEX, and discussed industry trends and issues and the performance, business, strategic direction and prospects of their
respective companies.

On November 2, 2017, Convergys’ board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting. At this meeting, Convergys’ board
of directors discussed Convergys’ near- and long-term strategy. As part of this discussion, Convergys’ board of directors reviewed
industry dynamics with an external advisor and discussed client demand for Convergys’ customer care services. Convergys’ board
of directors also reviewed Convergys’ growth alternatives in light of rapidly evolving industry dynamics, intensifying competitive
conditions, including volume fluctuations with Convergys’ largest communications and technology clients, price pressures and
technological changes relevant to Convergys’ business and its long-term prospects. Convergys’ board of directors considered the
potential need for a transformational shift in strategy, and the possibility of both organic and transactional strategic alternatives,
including potential acquisitions of technology companies. Convergys’ board of directors determined to continue the discussion at
future board meetings. Ms. Ayers separately communicated to Mr. Jeffrey Fox, the chairman of Convergys’ board of directors, that
given the time needed to pursue a possible transformational shift in strategy and previous discussions between Ms. Ayers and
Convergys’ board of directors on chief executive officer succession planning, Convergys might benefit from new leadership in its
next stage of its strategic development.

In late November 2017, a representative of Elliott Management Corporation, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Elliott, contacted Mr. Fox, to inform Mr. Fox that Elliott had acquired a 4.9% ownership stake in
Convergys. At that time, the representative of Elliott shared Elliott’s initial perspectives on Convergys’ leadership, operations and
financial performance, and suggested a meeting between Elliott and Convergys. Convergys continued a dialogue with Elliott over
the following months.

On January 8, 2018, Convergys’ board of directors held a special telephonic meeting, which was also attended by
representatives of Centerview, Convergys’ long-time financial advisor, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, Convergys’ legal
advisor, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Wachtell Lipton. At this meeting, Ms. Ayers expressed her
belief that Convergys was at a strategic inflection point, and that she believed a new chief executive officer should lead the next
phase of Convergys’ development. Following discussion, Convergys’ board of directors determined to continue discussion of a
possible chief executive officer succession process at the next regularly scheduled meeting of Convergys’ board of directors on
January 24, 2018.

On January 24, 2018, Convergys’ board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting, with representatives of Centerview
and Wachtell Lipton participating telephonically. At this meeting, Convergys’ board of directors discussed and approved the
implementation of a chief executive officer succession plan.

On January 25, 2018, Convergys publicly announced that Ms. Ayers would transition from her role as chief executive officer of
Convergys once her successor had been selected. Convergys also announced that it had initiated a search process to identify Ms.
Ayers’ successor.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On January 25, 2018, the chief executive officer of Party A telephoned Ms. Ayers. During the call, each of the participants
informally discussed the merits of combining their two companies. On January 26, 2018, representatives of a potential strategic
acquiror, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Party B, contacted Centerview to discuss a potential
strategic combination of Convergys and Party B.

On February 21, 2018, Convergys announced earnings for its 2017 fiscal year. Convergys announced that, on a year-over-year
basis, revenue and operating profit decreased, primarily due to volume fluctuations with Convergys’ largest communications and
technology clients.

On February 23, 2018, Convergys’ board of directors held a special telephonic meeting, with representatives of Centerview and
Wachtell Lipton present. At this meeting, Convergys’ board of directors discussed the financial attributes of Convergys, reviewed
Convergys’ financial plan and discussed with members of management and representatives of Centerview and Wachtell Lipton the
challenges facing the industry in general and Convergys in particular, including the volume fluctuations with Convergys’ largest
communications and technology clients, and potential strategic alternatives. After this discussion, Convergys’ board of directors
determined that it was in the best interests of Convergys and its shareholders to undertake an exploration of the strategic alternatives
reasonably available to Convergys to enhance shareholder value, including a potential sale of Convergys. Convergys’ board of
directors authorized management, with the assistance of Centerview and Wachtell Lipton, to explore strategic alternatives that
would include approaching both potential strategic acquirors and financial sponsors, and also to continue Convergys’ ongoing chief
executive officer search.

During the course of February and March 2018, at the direction of Convergys, representatives of Centerview engaged with a
total of 11 potential counterparties, receiving 5 inbound inquiries and conducting 6 outbound calls regarding potential interest in a
strategic transaction with Convergys. SYNNEX, Party A, Party B and a financial sponsor, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as Party C, entered into confidentiality agreements, which also included customary standstill provisions.
Centerview provided each party that had executed a confidentiality agreement with a confidential information memorandum that
Convergys management had prepared in consultation with Convergys’ advisors. The confidential information memorandum
provided business and financial information concerning Convergys and its operations.

On March 19, 2018, Ms. Ayers and Mr. Valentine, and a representative of Centerview, met for a dinner with the chief executive
officer, chief financial officer, chief legal officer and other representatives of Party B. At the dinner, the parties informally discussed
general industry conditions and the potential merits of combining their two companies.

During the week of March 20, 2018, Ms. Ayers, Mr. Valentine, and representatives of Centerview met separately with each of
SYNNEX, Party A, Party B and Party C at the offices of Centerview in New York. At each meeting, Ms. Ayers and Mr. Valentine
made a management presentation to each potential counterparty.

On March 20, 2018, Elliott contacted Mr. Fox and requested substantive engagement with Convergys concerning the
evaluation of Convergys’ strategic alternatives. Elliott also offered to participate as a financing source in any potential strategic
transaction, if it would be helpful to the overall process.

During the week of March 26, 2018, members of management and representatives of Centerview, at the direction of
Convergys, responded to bidders which had made diligence requests, including Party A and SYNNEX, regarding Convergys’
business operations and financial, legal, tax, human resources and other matters concerning Convergys.

On April 5, 2018, representatives of a financial sponsor, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Party D
responded to the draft confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement previously provided to them by Centerview and indicated an
interest in a potential strategic transaction with Convergys.

On April 6, 2018, Convergys’ board of directors held a special telephonic meeting, with representatives of Centerview and
Wachtell Lipton present. At this meeting, Convergys’ board of directors received an update on Convergys’ ongoing chief executive
officer search and, with the assistance of representatives of Centerview, discussed the outlook of Convergys and Centerview’s
preliminary financial analysis of Convergys and received an update on the status of outbound and inbound contacts with potentially
interested parties.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On April 6, 2018, at the direction of Convergys, representatives of Centerview sent first-round process letters on behalf of
Convergys to SYNNEX, Party A, Party B and Party C, requesting that each such party submit a proposal with respect to a potential
acquisition of Convergys by April 13, 2018.

On April 11, 2018, a representative of SYNNEX called Mr. Fox to discuss SYNNEX’ interest in a potential transaction with
Convergys.

On April 13, 2018, Elliott entered into a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement, which provided for a limited standstill
binding on Elliott. From this time through the execution of the merger agreement, at the request of Convergys, representatives of
Centerview periodically provided Elliott high-level updates on the strategic alternatives process and were advised of Elliott’s views
on the process.

On April 13 and 14, 2018, Convergys, through Centerview, received four first-round proposals: SYNNEX submitted a proposal
with a per share indicative price of $26.50, payable 50% in cash and 50% in stock, with the stock portion of such consideration
subject to a to-be-defined collar mechanism; Party A submitted a proposal with a per share indicative price of $25.50, payable 50%
in cash and 50% in stock; Party B submitted a proposal with a per share indicative price of $25.00 in cash (with an alternate
proposal for a “reverse merger” transaction with a claimed “theoretical value” per share of $29 assuming increase in the trading
multiple of the combined entity as compared to Convergys’ trading multiple, and the achievement of $200 million in synergies); and
Party C submitted a proposal with a per share indicative range of $26.50 to $29.50 in cash.

On April 16, 2018, representatives of Elliott sent a draft financing term sheet to representatives of Centerview and stated that
Elliot had the ability and willingness to act as a potential financing source to any of the bidders in Convergys’ strategic alternatives
process.

On April 17, 2018, Convergys’ board of directors held a special telephonic meeting, with representatives of Centerview and
Wachtell Lipton present. At this meeting, Convergys’ board of directors received an update on Convergys’ ongoing chief executive
officer search and, with the assistance of representatives of Centerview, Convergys’ board of directors received an update on the
bids received from each of SYNNEX, Party A, Party B and Party C. Mr. Fox asked for a more detailed discussion of the bids
received and Convergys’ strategic alternatives process at Convergys’ board of directors’ regularly scheduled meeting to be held on
April 25, 2018.

On April 18, 2018, Party D entered into a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement, which provided for a customary
standstill.

On April 25, 2018, Convergys’ board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting, at which it reviewed and discussed the
first-round proposals with members of management and representatives of Centerview and Wachtell Lipton. The representatives of
Centerview provided preliminary financial analyses of the proposals received, as well as a preliminary financial analysis of
Convergys were it to remain as a standalone public company. The members of Convergys’ board of directors also discussed with
members of senior management and representatives of Centerview and Wachtell Lipton the various challenges Convergys was
facing, and the impact of those challenges on these strategic alternatives. Following discussion, Convergys’ board of directors
approved inviting the four parties that had submitted first-round proposals—SYNNEX, Party A, Party B and Party C—to proceed to
a second-round bidding process.

On April 27, 2018, Party D held a management call with Ms. Ayers, Mr. Valentine and representatives of Centerview. On this
call, Ms. Ayers and Mr. Valentine made a management presentation to Party D.

On April 30, 2018, representatives of Party D spoke with representatives of Centerview. The representatives of Party D

portfolio company of Party D.

During the weeks of April 30 and May 7, 2018, Convergys’ senior management gave separate, detailed, in-person presentations
in Cincinnati, Ohio to representatives of SYNNEX, Party A, Party B and Party C. The meetings with SYNNEX, Party B and Party
C were in each case followed by a dinner, at which members of senior management of the respective parties were present. Over the
course of the meeting and dinner with Party B, representatives of Centerview communicated that Party B’s alternate proposal, which
contemplated a reverse takeover of Convergys by Party B’s private business, was significantly more complex and uncertain
compared to other proposals received.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

On May 2, 2018, SYNNEX’ board of directors held a meeting to discuss a potential transaction with Convergys. SYNNEX’
management presented SYNNEX’ board of directors with a summary of Convergys’ business, the benefits of a potential transaction
between the two companies, a proposed timeline and certain financial information, following which SYNNEX’ board of directors
expressed its support for continuing to explore the proposed transaction subject to satisfactory negotiation of an acquisition
agreement on acceptable terms.

On May 6 and 7, 2018, representatives of Centerview sent letters to SYNNEX, Party A, Party B and Party C describing the
requirements established by Convergys’ board of directors for the second round of the strategic alternatives process and provided
the four second-round participants with access to a virtual data room that contained detailed business, financial, regulatory, legal and
other information concerning Convergys. Over the course of the following weeks, Convergys uploaded documents to this data room
to facilitate the bidders’ ongoing diligence review.

On May 7, 2018, Convergys’ management met with Mr. Dennis Polk, chief executive officer of SYNNEX, Mr. Chris Caldwell,
president of Concentrix, Ms. Winnie Sun, senior vice president, operations and delivery of Concentrix, Mr. Philip Cassidy, senior
vice president, Europe, global applications development, solutions, pricing and strategic project management of Concentrix, Mr.
Steve Richie, senior vice president, legal, HR and corporate development of Concentrix, and Mr. Jason Marasigan, senior director of
corporate development of SYNNEX, for a full day meeting for due diligence purposes. Following the meeting, representatives of
Centerview met with representatives of SYNNEX to learn more about SYNNEX and encourage SYNNEX to increase its offer
price.

On May 10, 2018, a form of merger agreement was made available to SYNNEX, Party A, Party B and Party C.

On May 10, 2018, SYNNEX’ management provided an update by email to SYNNEX’ board of directors on the potential
transaction with Convergys, which included information about the market and the benefits of scale, updates from the in-person
meeting in Ohio and certain financial information.

On May 11, 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Convergys was exploring strategic alternatives, including a possible
sale. Media speculation regarding Convergys continued throughout the following days, including regarding the potential level of
interest and potential outcomes of Convergys’ process.

Between May 11, 2018 and May 17, 2018, Convergys continued to provide due diligence information and conducted due
diligence sessions with SYNNEX, Party A, Party B and Party C.

On May 18, 2018, Party B informed Convergys of its decision to withdraw from the strategic alternatives process.

On May 21, 2018, Ms. Ayers, Mr. Valentine and representatives of Centerview conducted a reverse due diligence session with
Mr. Caldwell, with a focus on potential synergies with SYNNEX.

On May 21 and 22, 2018, Convergys, through Centerview, received three second-round proposals: SYNNEX (with a per share
indicative price of $26.50, payable 50% in cash and 50% in stock, with a fixed exchange ratio for the stock portion of such
consideration subject to a to-be-defined collar mechanism); Party A (with a per share indicative price of $25.50, payable 50% in
cash and 50% in stock, with a fixed exchange ratio for the stock portion of such consideration); and Party C (with a per share
indicative range of $24.50 to $26.50 in cash), which proposal also included a draft debt commitment letter. Party A’s proposal did
not include a revised draft of the merger agreement or a draft debt commitment letter or other evidence of Party A’s ability to
finance the cash portion of its revised proposal. Party C indicated that the lower price per share reflected in its revised proposal
resulted from Party C’s due diligence, including its concerns regarding recent industry trends, operating performance, including
volume fluctuations with Convergys’ largest communications and technology clients, and the financial outlook of Convergys.
Representatives of Party C later orally indicated to representatives of Centerview that Party C would have difficulty making a bid at
or near the high end of its range (i.e., at $26.50).

On May 24, 2018, Convergys’ board of directors held a special telephonic meeting to review and discuss the second-round

Convergys’ Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendations of the Convergys Board of Directors that Convergys Shareholders
Adopt the Merger Agreement

In its evaluation of the merger agreement, the mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement,
Convergys’ board of directors consulted with Convergys’ management and its legal and financial advisors and considered a number
of factors, including the following (which are not necessarily in order of relative importance):

• the industry shift towards digital offerings, the need for new technological solutions, including artificial intelligence, and
the potential impact of such opportunities and risks on Convergys’ stand-alone operations and financial prospects;

• the current, historical and projected financial condition and results of operations of Convergys on a stand-alone basis,
including the risks to achieving its projected long-term results amid customer consolidation and the current and
prospective technical environment;

• the fact that the merger consideration, which consists of cash and shares of SYNNEX common stock, offers Convergys’
shareholders the opportunity to participate in the future earnings and growth of the combined company, while also
providing Convergys’ shareholders with a cash payment of $13.25 per share, which guarantees certainty of value for a
significant portion of the merger consideration;

• the belief of Convergys’ board of directors that the combined company will be able to provide better value by reducing
costs, expanding its geographic reach and leveraging best practices from each company, which will enable the combined
company to be a premier global customer engagement services company providing next generation customer experience
and business improvement to market-leading brands;

• the belief of Convergys’ board of directors that the transaction combines complementary assets and capabilities to form a
company with an enhanced ability that Convergys could not achieve on a stand-alone basis to work with customers to
better navigate the ever-evolving and increasingly complex customer experience ecosystem, including increased scale,
strong talent, best-in-class analytics, technology and digital offerings, a further diversified revenue base and the best mix
of global delivery options to create and execute customer experience strategies that are uniquely relevant to customers;

• the belief of Convergys’ board of directors that the combined company may be able to generate $150 million in annual
synergies by fiscal year 2021;

• the current and historical market prices for Convergys common shares, including the fact that the implied value of the
merger consideration of $26.50 per share (based on the 20-day volume weighted average price per share of SYNNEX
common stock as of June 27, 2018) represented an approximate premium of (1) 9.5% over the closing price per Convergys
common share on June 27, 2018 (the last trading day prior to the announcement of the merger), and (2) 18% over the
closing price per Convergys common share on May 10, 2018 (the last trading day prior to reports in the news media of
rumors that Convergys was engaged in a strategic review process);

• the fact that Convergys’ board of directors had carefully evaluated, in consultation with Convergys’ management and its
financial and legal advisors, various strategic alternatives available to Convergys, including remaining an independent
company or pursuing other alternative transactions, and exploring the possibility of potential business combinations with
other strategic bidders and financial bidders, and Convergys’ board of directors’ belief that the transaction with SYNNEX
offered greater certainty and less execution risk than the other strategic alternatives available to Convergys;

• notwithstanding the public speculation regarding a potential transaction involving Convergys for more than one month
prior to June 28, 2018, including speculation regarding SYNNEX’ interest in a transaction with Convergys, Convergys
had not received an acquisition proposal from any third party except for the proposals described in “Background of the

assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review
undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, the Consideration to be paid to the holders of Convergys common

TABLE OF CONTENTS

• The fact that Convergys’ board of directors, subject to certain conditions, has the right to change its recommendation of
the adoption of the merger agreement in response to a proposal to acquire Convergys that Convergys’ board of directors
determines is superior to the mergers or an intervening event with respect to Convergys, if Convergys’ board of directors
determines that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
Convergys’ shareholders;

• the belief of Convergys’ board of directors that the end date under the merger agreement of December 28, 2018 (which
may be increased by 90 days under certain circumstances) allows for sufficient time to complete the mergers; and

• the fact that Convergys may seek specific performance of SYNNEX’ obligations under the merger agreement.

In addition, Convergys’ board of directors also weighed the foregoing advantages and benefits against a variety of risks and
other potentially negative factors, including the following:

• the fact that the exchange ratio with respect to the stock portion of the merger consideration is fixed within certain ranges,
which could result in Convergys’ shareholders being adversely affected by a decrease in the trading price of shares of
SYNNEX common stock;

• the challenges inherent in the combination of the two companies, including the risk that integration of the two companies
may take more time and be more costly than anticipated, and the risk that the cost savings, synergies and other benefits
expected to be obtained as a result of the mergers might not be fully or timely realized;

• the amount of time it could take to complete the mergers, the potential for diversion of management focus for an extended
period and employee attrition, the potential inability to hire new employees and retain existing employees and the possible
adverse effects of the announcement and pendency of the transaction on customers, providers, vendors and other business
relationships, and the communities in which Convergys operates, in particular if the mergers are not completed;

• the restrictions under the terms of the merger agreement on the conduct of Convergys’ business prior to the completion of
the mergers, which could delay or prevent Convergys from undertaking material strategic opportunities that might arise
pending completion of the mergers to the detriment of Convergys’ shareholders, in particular if the mergers are not
completed;

• the risk that SYNNEX and Convergys might not meet their financial projections;

• the fact that SYNNEX and Convergys must obtain clearance under the HSR Act, as well as other approvals from certain
other foreign antitrust regulators, in order to complete the mergers, which approvals may not be obtained or may be
subject to conditions that SYNNEX is not required to accept;

• certain terms of the merger agreement, including:

• the limitation on Convergys’ ability to solicit alternative proposals;

• the fact that SYNNEX will not be required to take actions necessary to complete the mergers if such actions would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on SYNNEX after giving effect to the mergers (measured
assuming that SYNNEX is the same size as Convergys); and

• the fact that Convergys will be required to pay SYNNEX a termination fee of $74 million, which Convergys’ board
of directors, upon consultation with its advisors, concluded was customary and reasonable for transactions of this size
and type, if the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including a termination of the merger
agreement by SYNNEX as a result of a change of recommendation by Convergys’ board of directors;

• the risk that the mergers may not be completed, or that completion may be significantly delayed, for reasons beyond the
control of Convergys, including the failure to satisfy certain conditions to closing, including (1) the failure of SYNNEX’
shareholders to approve the stock issuance, and (2) the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals;

• the fact that certain of Convergys’ directors and executive officers may receive certain benefits that are different from, and
in addition to, those of Convergys’ other shareholders (see “Interests of Convergys Directors and Officers in the
Mergers”);

• the risks and uncertainties inherent in SYNNEX’ business and operations;

• the fact that any gain arising from the cash component of the merger consideration generally will be taxable to Convergys’
shareholders; and

• the risks described under the caption “Risk Factors.”

After considering the foregoing factors, Convergys’ board of directors concluded that, overall, the potentially beneficial factors
relating to the merger agreement and the mergers outweighed the risks and potentially negative factors.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by Convergys’ board of directors is not exhaustive but is
intended to reflect the material factors considered by Convergys’ board of directors in its consideration of the merger agreement, the
mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. In view of the complexity and the large number of
factors considered, Convergys’ board of directors, individually and collectively, did not quantify or assign any relative or specific
weight to the various factors. Rather, Convergys’ board of directors based its recommendation on the totality of the information
presented to and considered by it. In addition, individual members of Convergys’ board of directors may have given different
weights to different factors.

The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by Convergys’ board of directors is forward-looking in
nature. This information should be read in light of the factors described under the caption “Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements.”

After careful consideration, Convergys’ board of directors unanimously determined that the merger agreement, the mergers and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement were advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Convergys and
its shareholders, and unanimously declared advisable and in all respects approved and adopted the merger agreement, the mergers
and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

CONVERGYS’ BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE “FOR” THE ADOPTION OF
THE MERGER AGREEMENT.

SYNNEX’ Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendations of SYNNEX’ Board of Directors that SYNNEX Stockholders
Approve the Stock Issuance

In evaluating the merger agreement and the mergers, SYNNEX’ board of directors consulted with SYNNEX’ management and
its advisors and, in reaching its decision to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement, including the stock issuance, and to recommend that SYNNEX stockholders vote “FOR” the approval of the stock
issuance, SYNNEX’ board of directors considered a variety of factors, including the following (which are not necessarily in order of
relative importance):

SYNNEX believes that the acquisition of Convergys will enhance SYNNEX’ position as a leading business process services
company, with a more balanced portfolio between its Technology Solutions and Concentrix business segments. The acquisition of
Convergys and the combination of Convergys’ business with SYNNEX’ Concentrix business is expected to result in a number of
strategic benefits, including:

• Increases scale and diversifies revenue base. Concentrix will increase its portfolio client base, will gain an enhanced
presence in its current geographic locations, will add new key geographies, and will gain new global talent, which will
allow it to grow its business more quickly than it could otherwise do by growing organically. Concentrix will have service
delivery from a more robust global footprint and with 19 new languages.

• Significantly expands strategic client base and geographical footprint. Concentrix will gain Fortune 500/1000 clients,
Forbes Global 500/1000 clients, and a number of additional unicorn and disruptive high growth clients, which will
enhance its ability to compete in the industry. Concentrix will gain

strength in its existing footprint by increasing its presence in countries in which it already operates. It also will add the
following twelve countries to its footprint: France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Dominican Republic,
El Salvador, Honduras, Tunisia, Mauritius, and Egypt.

• Strengthens position in strategic industry verticals. Concentrix will deepen domain expertise in key strategic verticals—
Financial Services, Healthcare, Technology, and Automotive. It also will gain additional subject matter expertise, thought
leadership and innovative execution along with enhanced offerings in robotic process automation, digital and analytics.

In addition to the strategic factors summarized above, SYNNEX’ board of directors also considered the following factors in
connection with its evaluation of the mergers:

• the respective businesses, operations, management, financial condition, earnings and prospects of SYNNEX and
Convergys;

• the results of management’s due diligence investigation of Convergys and the reputation, business practices and
experience of Convergys and its management;

• the historical trading prices of shares of SYNNEX common stock and Convergys common shares;

• the review by SYNNEX’ board of directors with its advisors of the structure of the mergers and the financial and other
terms of the merger agreement;

• trends and competitive developments in the customer relationship management/business process outsourcing industry and
the range of strategic alternatives available to SYNNEX;

• that the combined company may be able to generate $150 million in annual synergies by fiscal year 2021;

• the fact that SYNNEX’ stockholders must approve the stock issuance;

• the fact that, because holders of outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock as of immediately prior to completion of
the mergers are expected to hold approximately 78% of the outstanding shares of SYNNEX common stock immediately
after completion of the mergers excluding the potential issuance of shares of SYNNEX common stock upon conversion of
the convertible debentures, SYNNEX stockholders are expected to have the opportunity to participate in the future
performance of the combined company, including synergies;

• the fact that the implied value of the merger consideration of $26.50 per share (based on the 20-day volume weighted
average price per share of SYNNEX common stock as of June 27, 2018) represented an approximate premium of (1) 9.5%
over the closing price per Convergys common share on June 27, 2018 (the last trading day prior to the announcement of
the merger), and (2) 18% over the closing price per Convergys common share on May 10, 2018 (the last trading day prior
to reports in the news media of rumors that Convergys was engaged in a strategic review process);

• the fact that the merger consideration is structured with a collar, which will give greater certainty as to the number of
shares of SYNNEX stock that will be issued in connection with the initial merger;

• the terms of the bridge commitment letter and the bridge facility thereunder, the terms of the takeout commitment letter
and the takeout facility thereunder, particularly in light of the then-current market for such commitments and facilities;

• the opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch, dated June 27, 2018, to SYNNEX’ board of directors as to the fairness, from a
financial point of view and as of the date of the opinion, to SYNNEX, of the merger consideration to be paid by SYNNEX
in the mergers, as more fully described below in the section “—Opinion of SYNNEX’ Financial Advisor”;

• the fact that, while SYNNEX is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions that are necessary, proper or
advisable under law to complete the mergers, such efforts standard would not obligate SYNNEX to take any actions which
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on SYNNEX and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, after
giving effect to the mergers (measured assuming SYNNEX is the same size as Convergys);

• the fact that Dennis Polk will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer of SYNNEX following the completion of the
mergers; and

• the fact that Convergys is required to pay SYNNEX a termination fee of $74.0 million (or $37.0 million, in certain
circumstances) or an expense reimbursement fee of $12.35 million if the merger agreement is terminated under certain
circumstances.

SYNNEX’ board of directors also considered a number of uncertainties and risks in its deliberations concerning the mergers,
including the following:

• the dilution associated with the stock issuance;

• the risk that the mergers may not be completed despite the parties’ efforts or that completion of the mergers may be
delayed, even if the requisite approvals are obtained from SYNNEX stockholders and Convergys shareholders, including
the possibility that conditions to the parties’ obligations to complete the mergers may not be satisfied, and the potential
resulting disruptions to SYNNEX’ and Convergys’ businesses;

• the potential length of the regulatory approval process and the period of time during which SYNNEX may be subject to
the merger agreement;

• the possibility that governmental authorities might seek to require certain actions of SYNNEX or Convergys or impose
certain terms, conditions or limitations on SYNNEX’ or Convergys’ businesses in connection with granting approval of
the mergers or might otherwise seek to prevent or delay the mergers, including the risk that governmental authorities
might seek an injunction;

• the fact that SYNNEX is required to pay Convergys an expense reimbursement fee of $12.35 million if the merger
agreement is terminated because the stock issuance is not approved by the SYNNEX stockholders;

• the fact that SYNNEX has incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction costs and expenses in connection
with the mergers, regardless of whether they are completed;

• the risk that the potential benefits of the mergers may not be fully realized, including the possibility that cost savings and
operating efficiencies expected to result from the mergers may not be realized to the extent or on the timeline expected, or
at all;

• the risks inherent in the businesses of SYNNEX and Convergys;

• the risk of diverting SYNNEX management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational
matters, and potential disruption of SYNNEX management associated with the mergers and integrating the companies;

• the fact that SYNNEX will be subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its businesses during the period between
signing the merger agreement and completion of the mergers;

• Convergys’ ability, under circumstances described in the merger agreement, to provide information to and engage in
discussions or negotiations with a third party that makes a bona fide unsolicited written takeover proposal;

• the ability of Convergys’ board of directors, subject to certain conditions, to change its recommendation supporting the
mergers in response to a takeover proposal that constitutes a superior proposal or an intervening event, if Convergys’
board of directors determines that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties;

• the absence of a financing condition, and Convergys’ ability to specifically enforce SYNNEX’ obligations under the
merger agreement;

• the potential negative effects of the pendency of the mergers on SYNNEX’ businesses and relationships with employees,
customers, providers, vendors, regulators and the communities in which it operates, including the risk that certain key
members of senior management of SYNNEX or Convergys might not choose to remain with the combined company; and

• various other risks associated with the mergers and the businesses of SYNNEX, Convergys and the combined company
described under “Risk Factors.”

TABLE OF CONTENTS

During its consideration of the mergers, SYNNEX’ board of directors was also aware that certain of Convergys’ directors and
executive officers may have interests in the mergers that are different from or in addition to those of Convergys shareholders
generally, as described under “Interests of Convergys’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers.”

The above discussion of the material factors considered by SYNNEX’ board of directors in its consideration of the mergers and
the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement is not intended to be exhaustive, but does set forth the principal factors
considered by SYNNEX’ board of directors. In light of the number and wide variety of factors considered in connection with the
evaluation of the mergers, SYNNEX’ board of directors did not consider it practicable to, and did not attempt to, quantify or
otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its final decision. SYNNEX’ board of directors
viewed its position as being based on all of the information available to it and the factors presented to and considered by it.
However, some directors may themselves have given different weight to different factors. The factors, potential risks and
uncertainties contained in this explanation of SYNNEX’ reasons for the mergers and other information presented in this section
contain information that is forward-looking in nature and, therefore, should be read in light of the factors discussed in “Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”

SYNNEX’ BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT SYNNEX STOCKHOLDERS VOTE
“FOR” THE STOCK ISSUANCE.

Opinion of Convergys’ Financial Advisor

On June 28, 2018, Centerview rendered to Convergys’ board of directors its oral opinion, subsequently confirmed in a written
opinion dated June 28, 2018, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion, the
Consideration to be paid to the holders of Convergys common shares (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to the merger
agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

The full text of Centerview’s written opinion, dated June 28, 2018, which describes the assumptions made, procedures
followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview in preparing its opinion,
is attached as Annex B and is incorporated herein by reference. The summary of the written opinion of Centerview set forth
below is qualified in its entirety to the full text of Centerview’s written opinion attached as Annex B. Centerview’s financial
advisory services and opinion were provided for the information and assistance of Convergys’ board of directors (in their

Transaction and Centerview’s opinion only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date thereof, to
the holders of Convergys common shares (other than Excluded Shares) of the Consideration to be paid to such holders
pursuant to the merger agreement. Centerview’s opinion did not address any other term or aspect of the merger agreement
or the Transaction and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder of Convergys or any other person as to
how such shareholder or other person should vote or otherwise act with respect to the Transaction or any other matter.

The full text of Centerview’s written opinion should be read carefully in its entirety for a description of the assumptions
made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by
Centerview in preparing its opinion.

• certain other communications from Convergys and SYNNEX to their respective shareholders;

• certain internal information relating to the business, operations, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of
Convergys, including certain financial forecasts, analyses and projections relating to Convergys prepared by management
of Convergys and furnished to Centerview by Convergys for purposes of Centerview’s analysis, which are referred to in
this summary of Centerview’s opinion as the Convergys forecasts, and which are collectively referred to in this summary
of Centerview’s opinion as the Convergys internal data;

• certain internal information relating to the business, operations, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of
SYNNEX, which are collectively referred to in this summary of Centerview’s opinion as the SYNNEX internal data;

• certain publicly available research analysts’ estimates relating to SYNNEX for 2018 and 2019 as extrapolated based on
discussions with the management of SYNNEX and furnished to Centerview by Convergys for purposes of Centerview’s
analysis, which are referred to in this summary of Centerview’s opinion as the SYNNEX public forecasts; and

• certain cost savings and operating synergies projected by the management of SYNNEX to result from the Transaction
furnished to Centerview for purposes of Centerview’s analysis, which are referred to in this summary of Centerview’s
opinion as the synergies.

Centerview also participated in discussions with members of the senior management and representatives of Convergys and
SYNNEX regarding their assessment of the Convergys internal data (including, without limitation the Convergys forecasts), the
SYNNEX internal data, the SYNNEX public forecasts and the synergies, as appropriate, and the strategic rationale for the
Transaction. In addition, Centerview reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data, including valuation multiples, for
Convergys and SYNNEX and compared that data with similar data for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly
traded, in lines of business that Centerview deemed relevant. Centerview also compared certain of the proposed financial terms of
the Transaction with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that Centerview deemed
relevant, and conducted such other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as Centerview
deemed appropriate.

Centerview assumed, without independent verification or any responsibility therefor, the accuracy and completeness of the
financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information supplied to, discussed with, or reviewed by Centerview for
purposes of its opinion and, with Convergys’ consent, Centerview relied upon such information as being complete and accurate. In
that regard, Centerview assumed, at Convergys’ direction, that the Convergys internal data (including, without limitation, the
Convergys forecasts) were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the
management of Convergys as to the matters covered thereby, that the SYNNEX internal data and the synergies were reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of SYNNEX as to the matters
covered thereby, and that the SYNNEX public forecasts are a reasonable basis upon which to evaluate the future financial
performance of SYNNEX, and Centerview relied, at Convergys’ direction, on the Convergys internal data, the SYNNEX internal
data, the SYNNEX public forecasts and the synergies for purposes of Centerview’s analysis and opinion. Centerview expressed no
view or opinion as to the Internal Data (including, without limitation, the Convergys forecasts), the SYNNEX internal data, the
SYNNEX public forecasts, the synergies or the assumptions on which they were based. In addition, at Convergys’ direction,
Centerview did not make any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-
balance-sheet or otherwise) of Convergys or SYNNEX, nor was Centerview furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal, and
was not asked to conduct, and did not conduct, a physical inspection of the properties or assets of Convergys or SYNNEX.
Centerview assumed, at Convergys’ direction, that the final executed merger agreement would not differ in any respect material to
Centerview’s analysis or opinion from the Draft Merger Agreement reviewed by Centerview. Centerview also assumed, at
Convergys’ direction, that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement and in accordance
with all applicable laws and other relevant documents or requirements, without delay or the waiver, modification or amendment of
any term, condition or agreement, the effect of which would be material to Centerview’s analysis or Centerview’s opinion and that,
in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the
Transaction, no delay, limitation, restriction, condition or other

material to Centerview’s analysis or Centerview’s opinion. Centerview did not evaluate and did not express any opinion as to the
solvency or fair value of Convergys or SYNNEX, or the ability of Convergys or SYNNEX to pay their respective obligations when
they come due, or as to the impact of the Transaction on such matters, under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar matters. Centerview is not a legal, regulatory, tax or accounting advisor, and Centerview expressed no opinion
as to any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters.

Centerview’s opinion expressed no view as to, and did not address, Convergys’ underlying business decision to proceed with or
effect the Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that
might be available to Convergys or in which Convergys might engage. Centerview’s opinion was limited to and addressed only the
fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date of Centerview’s written opinion, to the holders of Convergys common shares
(other than Excluded Shares) of the Consideration to be paid to such holders pursuant to the merger agreement. For purposes of its
opinion, Centerview was not asked to, and Centerview did not, express any view on, and its opinion did not address, any other term
or aspect of the merger agreement or the Transaction, including, without limitation, the structure or form of the Transaction, or any
other agreements or arrangements contemplated by the merger agreement or entered into in connection with or otherwise
contemplated by the Transaction, including, without limitation, the fairness of the Transaction or any other term or aspect of the
Transaction to, or any consideration to be received in connection therewith by, or the impact of the Transaction on, the holders of
any other class of securities, creditors or other constituencies of Convergys or any other party. In addition, Centerview expressed no
view or opinion as to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to be paid
or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of Convergys or any party, or class of such persons in connection with the
Transaction, whether relative to the Consideration to be paid to the holders of Convergys common shares (other than Excluded
Shares) pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Centerview’s opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic,
monetary, currency, market and other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to
Centerview as of, the date of Centerview’s written opinion, and Centerview does not have any obligation or responsibility to update,
revise or reaffirm its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date of Centerview’s written
opinion. Centerview expressed no view or opinion as to what the value of shares of SYNNEX common stock actually will be when
issued pursuant to the Transaction or the prices at which Convergys common shares or Parent Shares will trade or otherwise be

Summary of Centerview Financial Analysis

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared and reviewed with Convergys’ board of directors in
connection with Centerview’s written opinion, dated June 28, 2018. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a
complete description of the financial analyses performed or factors considered by, and underlying the opinion of,
Centerview, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or weight given to those
financial analyses by Centerview. Centerview may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions, so the reference ranges resulting from any particular portion of the analyses summarized below should not be
taken to be Centerview’s view of the actual value of Convergys. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses set forth
below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, the tables must
be read together with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial
analyses performed by Centerview. Considering the data in the tables below without considering all financial analyses or
factors or the full narrative description of such analyses or factors, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying
such analyses or factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Centerview’s financial
analyses and its opinion. In performing its analyses, Centerview made numerous assumptions with respect to industry
performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are

II or Centerview or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any
estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of Convergys do not

Convergys Financial Analysis

Selected Public Company Analysis

Centerview reviewed and compared certain financial information, ratios and multiples for Convergys to corresponding
financial information, ratios and multiples for publicly traded companies that Centerview deemed comparable, based on its
experience and professional judgment, to Convergys. The selected public companies consisted of:

• Teleperformance SE

• TTEC Holdings, Inc.

• Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated

• Atento SA

Although none of the selected public companies is directly comparable to Convergys, these companies were selected, among
other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with certain operational and financial characteristics, which, for purposes
of its analyses, Centerview considered to be similar to those of Convergys. However, because none of the selected companies is
exactly the same as Convergys, Centerview believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the
quantitative results of the selected public company analysis. Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments, based on its
experience and professional judgment, concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and
prospects of Convergys and the selected companies that could affect the public trading values of each in order to provide a context
in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis.

Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources as of June 27, 2018, Centerview
calculated, for each selected company, (i) enterprise value (calculated as the market value of common equity (determined using the
fully diluted equity value) plus net debt and including adjustments for equity investments or non-controlling interests) as a multiple
of Wall Street research analyst consensus estimated earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization
and non-recurring items (which is referred to in this summary of Centerview’s opinion as “Adjusted EBITDA”) for the applicable
company for calendar year 2018, which is referred to as the Adjusted EBITDA multiple, and (ii) the ratio of stock price to Wall
Street research analyst consensus estimated earnings per share of outstanding capital stock, excluding non-recurring items (which is
referred to in this summary of Centerview’s opinion as “Adjusted EPS”) for the applicable company for calendar year 2018, which
is referred to as the Adjusted EPS multiple. The results of these analyses are summarized below:

(2) The “Street Case Forecasts” refers to results based on Wall Street research analyst consensus estimates.

(3) The “Base Case Forecasts” refers to results based on the Convergys management projections, which are described in the section titled “Convergys
Management Projections.”

(4) The “Alternative Case Forecasts” refers to results based on the Convergys bidder projections, which are described in the Section titled “Convergys Bidder
Projections.”

Based on its experience and professional judgment, for purposes of its analysis Centerview selected a reference range of
enterprise value to calendar year 2018 estimated Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 6.5x to 9.0x and a reference range of calendar year
2018 estimated Adjusted EPS multiples of 12.5x to 17.0x. In selecting these reference ranges, Centerview made qualitative
judgments based on its experience and professional judgment concerning differences between the business, financial and operating
characteristics and prospects of Convergys and the selected companies that could affect the public trading values in order to provide
a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis.

Centerview applied the Adjusted EBITDA multiple reference range to Convergys’ calendar year 2018 estimated Adjusted
EBITDA as set forth in the Base Case Forecasts to derive a range of implied enterprise values for Convergys. Centerview subtracted
from this range of implied enterprise values Convergys’ net debt as of April 30, 2018 as set forth in the Convergys internal data to
derive a range of equity values for Convergys. Centerview then divided these implied equity values by the number of fully diluted
outstanding Convergys common shares as of June 27, 2018 as set forth in the Convergys internal data to derive a range of implied
values per Convergys common share. Centerview also applied the EPS multiple reference range to Convergys’ calendar year 2018
estimated Adjusted EPS as set forth in the Base Case Forecasts to derive a range of implied values per Convergys common share.

The results of this analysis, rounded to the nearest $0.25, are summarized below:
Valuation Metric Implied Share Price
Enterprise Value/2018 Estimated Adjusted EBITDA $20.00 – $28.25
Stock Price/2018 Estimated Adjusted Earnings $22.00 – $29.75

Centerview then compared these ranges to the value of the Consideration of $26.50 implied by a reference price of $111.08 per
share of SYNNEX common stock (the volume-weighted average trading price per share of SYNNEX common stock over the 20
trading day period ended June 27, 2018).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

No company or transaction used in this analysis is directly comparable to Convergys or SYNNEX or the Transaction. The
transactions included in the selected transactions were selected, among other reasons, because they involved companies with certain
operational and financial characteristics that, for the purposes of its analysis, Centerview considered to be similar to those of
Convergys. The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the selected transactions analyzed were diverse, and there
are inherent differences in the business, operations, financial conditions and prospects of Convergys and SYNNEX and the
companies involved in the selected transactions.

For each of the selected transactions, based on public filings, press releases made by the companies involved and other publicly
available information, Centerview calculated and compared the enterprise value implied for each target company based on the
consideration payable in the applicable selected transaction as a multiple of EBITDA for the last available four-quarter period prior
to the announcement of the applicable transaction, which is referred to as LTM EBITDA. The results of this analysis are
summarized below:

Based on its analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the selected transactions, Centerview selected a reference range of
multiples of enterprise value to LTM EBITDA of 6.5x to 9.0x. In selecting this reference range, Centerview made qualitative
judgments based on its experience and professional judgment concerning differences between the business, financial and operating
characteristics and prospects of Convergys and the companies involved in the selected transactions and other factors that could
affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of such companies or Convergys in order to provide a context in which to
consider the results of the quantitative analysis.

Centerview applied this reference range to the LTM EBITDA for Convergys as of March 31, 2018 as set forth in the Convergys
internal data to calculate a range of implied enterprise values for Convergys. Centerview subtracted from this range of implied
enterprise values Convergys’ net debt as of April 30, 2018 as set forth in the Convergys internal data to derive a range of equity
values for Convergys. Centerview then divided these implied equity values for Convergys by the number of fully diluted
outstanding Convergys common shares as of June 27, 2018 as set forth in the Convergys internal data to derive a range of implied
values per Convergys common share.

This resulted in a range of implied values of $20.00 to $28.25 per Convergys common share, rounded to the nearest $0.25.
Centerview then compared this range to the value of the Consideration of $26.50 implied by a reference price of $111.08 per share
of SYNNEX common stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Centerview performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Convergys, which is a traditional valuation methodology used to
derive a valuation of an asset by calculating the “present value” of estimated future cash flows of the asset. “Present value” refers to
the current value of future cash flows and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows by a discount rate that takes into
account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate
factors.

In performing this analysis, Centerview calculated a range of illustrative equity values for Convergys by (1) discounting to
present value as of April 30, 2018 using discount rates ranging from 9.5% to 11.5% (reflecting Centerview’s analysis of Convergys’
weighted average cost of capital) and a mid-year discounting convention: (a) the forecasted unlevered free cash flows of Convergys
reflected in each of the Base Case Forecasts and the Alternative Case Forecasts for the period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending
on December 31, 2022 (with calendar year 2018 being pro-rated for the eight months remaining in the calendar year) and (b) a range
of illustrative terminal values of Convergys at the end of the forecast period, calculated by Centerview applying perpetuity growth
rates ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%, which Centerview selected based on its professional judgment and (2) subtracting from the
foregoing results Convergys’ net debt as of April 30, 2018 as set forth in the Convergys internal data.

Centerview then divided these implied equity values by the number of fully diluted outstanding Convergys common shares as
of June 27, 2018 as set forth in the Convergys internal data to derive a ranges, rounded to the nearest $0.25, of implied values per
Convergys common share as follows:
Base Case Forecasts $20.50 to $28.25
Alternative Case Forecasts $21.75 to $30.25

Centerview then compared these ranges to the value of the Consideration of $26.50 implied by a reference price of $111.08 per
share of SYNNEX common stock.

SYNNEX Financial Analysis

Selected Public Company Analysis

Centerview reviewed and compared certain financial information, ratios and multiples for SYNNEX to corresponding financial
information, ratios and multiples for publicly traded companies that Centerview deemed comparable, based on its experience and
professional judgment, to SYNNEX. The selected public companies consisted of:

• CDW Corporation

• ScanSource, Inc.

• Avnet, Inc.

• Insight Enterprises Inc.

• Arrow Electronics, Inc.

• Tech Data Corporation

• Teleperformance SE

• TTEC Holdings, Inc.

• Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated

• Atento SA

• Convergys

Although none of the selected public companies is directly comparable to SYNNEX, these companies were selected, among
other reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with certain operational and financial characteristics, which, for purposes
of its analyses, Centerview considered to be similar to those of SYNNEX. However, because none of the selected companies is

Accordingly, Centerview also made qualitative judgments, based on its experience and professional judgment, concerning
differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of SYNNEX and the selected companies that
could affect the public trading values of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative
analysis.

Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources as of June 27, 2018, Centerview
calculated, for each selected company, (i) the calendar year 2018 estimated Adjusted EBITDA multiple based on Wall Street
research analyst consensus estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the applicable company for calendar year 2018, and (ii) the calendar
year 2018 estimated Adjusted EPS multiple based on Wall Street research analyst consensus estimated Adjusted EPS for the

(4) Based on SYNNEX’ public forecasts.

Based on its experience and professional judgment, for purposes of its analysis Centerview selected a reference range of
enterprise value to calendar year 2018 estimated Adjusted EBITDA multiples of 6.8x to 10.0x and a reference range of calendar
year 2018 estimated Adjusted EPS multiples of 9.0x to 14.0x. In selecting these reference ranges, Centerview made qualitative
judgments based on its experience and professional judgment concerning differences between the business, financial and operating
characteristics and prospects of SYNNEX and the selected companies that could affect the public trading values in order to provide
a context in which to consider the results of the quantitative analysis.

Centerview applied the Adjusted EBITDA multiple reference range to SYNNEX’ fiscal year 2018 estimated Adjusted
EBITDA as set forth in the SYNNEX public forecasts to derive a range of implied enterprise values for SYNNEX. Centerview
subtracted from this range of implied enterprise values SYNNEX’ net debt as of February 28, 2018 as set forth in SYNNEX SEC
filings to derive a range of equity values for SYNNEX. Centerview then divided these implied equity values by the number of fully

implied values per share of SYNNEX common stock. Centerview also applied the Adjusted EPS multiple reference range to
SYNNEX’ fiscal year 2018 estimated Adjusted EPS as set forth in the SYNNEX public forecasts to derive a range of implied values
per share of SYNNEX common stock.

The results of this analysis, rounded to the nearest $0.25, are summarized below:

Valuation Metric
Implied Share

Price
      
Enterprise Value/2018 Estimated Adjusted EBITDA $87.25 – $145.75
Stock Price/2018 Estimated Earnings $90.25 – $140.25

Centerview then compared this range to (i) the closing price per share of SYNNEX common stock on June 27, 2018 of $107.55
and (ii) a reference price of $111.08 per share of SYNNEX common stock.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

Centerview performed a discounted cash flow analysis of SYNNEX. In performing this analysis, Centerview calculated a range
of illustrative equity values for SYNNEX by (1) discounting to present value as of February 28, 2018 using discount rates ranging
from 9.0% to 11.0% (reflecting Centerview’s analysis of SYNNEX’ weighted average cost of capital) and a mid-year discounting
convention: (a) the forecasted unlevered free cash flows of SYNNEX reflected in the SYNNEX public forecasts for the period
beginning December 1, 2017 and ending on November 30, 2022 (with fiscal year 2018 being pro-rated for the nine months
remaining in the fiscal year) and (b) a range of illustrative terminal values of SYNNEX at the end of the forecast period, calculated
by Centerview applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 2.0% to 3.0%, which Centerview selected based on its professional
judgment and (2) subtracting from the foregoing results SYNNEX’ net debt as of February 28, 2018 as set forth in SYNNEX SEC
filings.

Centerview then divided the resulting implied equity values by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of SYNNEX
common stock as of June 28, 2018 as set forth in the SYNNEX internal data to derive a range of implied values per share of
SYNNEX common stock of $95.75 to $151.25, rounded to the nearest $0.25. Centerview then compared these ranges to (i) the
closing price per share of SYNNEX common stock on June 27, 2018 of $107.55 and (ii) a reference price of $111.08 per share of
SYNNEX common stock.

Other Factors

Centerview noted for Convergys’ board of directors certain additional factors solely for informational purposes, including,
among other things, the following:

• Historical Stock Price Trading Analysis of Convergys. Centerview reviewed the stock price performance of Convergys
common shares for the 52-week period up to and including May 10, 2018. Centerview noted that the range of low and
high closing prices of Convergys common shares during the prior 52-week period was $21.47 to $26.65, as compared to
the implied value of $26.50 for the Consideration to be paid in respect of each Convergys common share (other than
Excluded Shares).

• Analyst Price Target Analysis of Convergys. Centerview reviewed stock price targets for Convergys common shares
reflected in certain publicly available Wall Street research analyst reports as of June 27, 2018. Centerview noted that the
analyst stock price targets in such research analyst reports ranged from $22.00 to $24.00 per Convergys common share, as
compared to the implied value of $26.50 for the Consideration to be paid in respect of each Convergys common share
(other than Excluded Shares).

• Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis of Convergys. Centerview performed an illustrative analysis of
the implied present value of the future price per Convergys common share based on (i) Convergys’ Adjusted EBITDA
multiple and (ii) Convergys’ Adjusted EPS multiple (based on the Base Case Forecasts).

• Adjusted EBITDA Multiple. In calculating the implied present value of future share price of Convergys common
shares based on Convergys’ Adjusted EBITDA multiple, Centerview first calculated the implied enterprise value of
Convergys for the end of each of calendar years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 by multiplying the estimated one-year
forward Adjusted EBITDA of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Convergys (as provided by Convergys management) at the end of each respective period by an Adjusted EBITDA
multiple equal to 7.2x. Centerview then calculated the implied equity value of Convergys for each of calendar years
2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 by subtracting the estimated net debt of Convergys at the end of each respective period.
Centerview then divided the equity values by the total number of outstanding Convergys common shares on a fully
diluted basis. Centerview then discounted those implied values to June 27, 2018 by using an equity discount rate
equal to 11.5%. Additionally, Centerview added the present value (using an equity discount rate equal to 11.5%) of
the cumulative dividends per share estimated to be paid through the end of each of calendar years 2018, 2019, 2020,
and 2021. The analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of one Convergys common share as of June 27,
2018, rounded to the nearest $0.25, equal to $22.75, $22.75, $22.50, and $22.25 for the end of calendar year 2018,
2019, 2020, and 2021, respectfully.

• Adjusted EPS Multiple. In calculating the implied present value of future share price of Convergys common shares
based on Convergys’ Adjusted EPS multiple, Centerview first calculated the implied equity value per Convergys
common share for the end of each of calendar years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 by multiplying the estimated one-
year forward Adjusted EPS of Convergys (as provided by management) at the end of each respective period by an
Adjusted EPS multiple equal to 12.8x. Centerview then discounted those implied values to June 27, 2018 by using an
equity discount rate equal to 11.5%. Additionally, Centerview added the present value (using an equity discount rate
equal to 11.5%) of the cumulative dividends per share estimated to be paid through the end of each of calendar years
2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. The analysis resulted in a range of implied present values of one Convergys common
share as of June 27, 2018, rounded to the nearest $0.25, equal to $23.00, $22.75, $22.25, and $21.75 for the end of
calendar year 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectfully.

• Historical Trading Multiples of Convergys. Centerview reviewed Convergys’ next twelve month Adjusted EBITDA

price of $111.08 per share of SYNNEX common stock.

• Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis of SYNNEX Pro-Forma the Transaction (“SYNNEX PF”).
Centerview performed an illustrative analysis of the implied present value of the future price per share of the SYNNEX PF
entity based on (i) SYNNEX’ Adjusted EBITDA multiple, (ii) SYNNEX and Convergys’ weighted average Adjusted
EBITDA multiple (weighted by enterprise value) (iii) SYNNEX’ Adjusted EPS multiple, and (iv) SYNNEX and
Convergys’ weighted average Adjusted EPS multiple (weighted by equity value) (based on the Base Case Forecasts and

• SYNNEX’ Adjusted EBITDA Multiple. In calculating the implied present value of future share price of SYNNEX PF
common stock based on SYNNEX’ Adjusted EBITDA multiple, Centerview first calculated the implied enterprise
value of SYNNEX PF for the end of each of calendar years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 by multiplying the estimated
one-year forward Adjusted EBITDA of SYNNEX PF at the end of each respective period by an Adjusted EBITDA
multiple equal to 7.9x. Centerview then calculated the implied equity value of SYNNEX PF for each of calendar
years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 by subtracting the estimated net debt of SYNNEX PF at the end of each respective
period. Centerview then calculated the implied equity value per share of SYNNEX PF common stock for each of the
calendar years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 by dividing the equity values by the total number of outstanding shares of
SYNNEX PF common stock on a fully diluted basis. Centerview then calculated the implied value of the equity
Consideration for each of the calendar years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 by multiplying the equity values per share
of SYNNEX PF common stock by the exchange ratio. Centerview then discounted those implied values to June 27,
2018 by using an equity discount rate equal to 11.5%. Centerview then calculated the cumulative dividends per share
estimated to be paid through the end of each of calendar years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 and multiplied these
figures by the exchange ratio to arrive at the cumulative dividends per share attributable to Convergys shareholders.
Centerview discounted the cumulative dividends per share attributable to Convergys shareholders to June 27, 2018
by using an equity discount rate equal to 11.5%. Finally, Centerview added the implied present value of the equity
Consideration, the discounted value of the cumulative dividends attributable to Convergys shareholders, and the cash
Consideration to arrive at an illustrative present value of the Consideration to Convergys shareholders. The analysis
resulted in a range of implied present values of the Consideration per share to Convergys shareholders, rounded to the
nearest $0.25, equal to $27.50, $28.75, $29.75, and $30.00 for the end of calendar year 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021,

General

The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most
appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and,
therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Centerview did not draw,
in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or analysis that it considered. Rather, Centerview made its determination
as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses.

Centerview’s financial analyses and opinion were only one of many factors taken into consideration by Convergys’ board of
directors in its evaluation of the Transaction. Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative of
the views of Convergys’ board of directors or management of Convergys with respect to the Consideration or as to whether
Convergys’ board of directors would have been willing to determine that a different consideration was fair. The consideration for the
Transaction was determined through arm’s-length negotiations between Convergys and SYNNEX and was approved by Convergys’
board of directors. Centerview provided advice to Convergys during these negotiations. Centerview did not, however recommend
any specific amount of consideration to Convergys or Convergys’ board of directors or that any specific amount of consideration
constituted the only appropriate consideration for the transaction.

Centerview is a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking,
financial advisory and merchant banking activities. In the two years prior to the date of its written opinion Centerview was engaged
to provide certain financial advisory services to Convergys from time to time, including in connection with an acquisition
transaction, and Centerview received $1,500,000 in compensation from Convergys for such services. In the two years prior to the
date of its written opinion, Centerview was not engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to SYNNEX, and
Centerview did not receive any compensation from SYNNEX during such period. Centerview may provide investment banking and
other services to or with respect to Convergys or SYNNEX or their respective affiliates in the future, for which Centerview may
receive compensation. Certain (i) of Centerview’s and Centerview’s affiliates’ directors, officers, members and employees, or family
members of such persons, (ii) of Centerview’s affiliates or related investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in
which any of the foregoing may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or
trade, in debt, equity and other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or
investments in, Convergys, SYNNEX, or any of their respective affiliates, or any other party that may be involved in the
Transaction.

Convergys’ board of directors selected Centerview as its financial advisor in connection with the Transaction based on
Centerview’s reputation, experience within Convergys’ industry, and advisory relationship with Convergys over the past decade.
Centerview is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the
Transaction.

In connection with Centerview’s services as the financial advisor to Convergys’ board of directors, Convergys has agreed to
pay Centerview an estimated aggregate fee of approximately $46 million (estimated as of August 1, 2018), of which $5 million was
payable upon the rendering of Centerview’s opinion and approximately $41 million of which is payable contingent upon
consummation of the Transaction. In addition, Convergys has agreed to reimburse certain of Centerview’s expenses arising, and to
indemnify Centerview against certain liabilities that may arise, out of Centerview’s engagement.

Opinion of SYNNEX’ Financial Advisor

SYNNEX retained BofA Merrill Lynch to act as its financial advisor in connection with the mergers solely to render its opinion
to SYNNEX’ board of directors as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to SYNNEX of the merger consideration (which
for purposes of this section, the section “Summary—Opinion of SYNNEX’ Financial Advisor” and each other part of this joint
proxy statement/prospectus that refers to the opinion of BofA Merrill Lynch, means $13.25 in cash, without interest, and 0.1193
shares of SYNNEX common stock, for each Convergys common share). BofA Merrill Lynch is an internationally recognized
investment banking firm which is regularly engaged in the valuation of businesses and securities in connection with mergers and
acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private placements and valuations
for corporate and other purposes. SYNNEX selected BofA Merrill Lynch on the basis of BofA Merrill Lynch’s experience in
transactions similar to the mergers, its reputation in the investment community and its familiarity with SYNNEX, Convergys and
their respective businesses.

discussed with it and relied upon the assurances of the managements of SYNNEXand Convergys that they were not aware of any
facts or circumstances that would make such information or data inaccurate or misleading in any material respect. With respect to
the Convergys forecasts, BofA Merrill Lynch was advised by Convergys, and assumed, that they have been reasonably prepared on
bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the management of Convergys as to the future
financial performance of Convergys. With respect to the adjusted Convergys forecasts, the SYNNEX forecasts and the cost savings,
BofA Merrill Lynch assumed, at the direction of SYNNEX, that they had been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best

agreement and that, in the course of obtaining the necessarygovernmental, regulatory and other approvals, consents, releases and
waivers for the mergers, no delay, limitation, restriction or condition, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or
modifications, will be imposed that would have an adverse effect on Convergys, SYNNEX or the contemplated benefits of the
mergers. BofA Merrill Lynch also assumed, at the direction of SYNNEX, that the mergers will qualify for federal income tax
purposes as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code. BofA Merrill Lynch also assumed, at the direction
of SYNNEX, that the final executed merger agreement will not differ in any material respect from the draft merger agreement
reviewed by BofA Merrill Lynch.

statement/prospectus as Non-GAAP EPS. The overall low to high calendar year 2018 and 2019 estimated Non-GAAP EPS
multiples observed for the selected publicly traded companies were 14.0x to 18.8x (with a mean of 16.5x and a median of 16.7x)
and 12.4x to 16.9x (with a mean of 15.2x and a median of 16.1x), respectively. BofA Merrill Lynch also reviewed enterprise values
of the selected publicly traded companies, calculated as equity values based on closing stock prices on June 27, 2018, plus debt, and
less cash, as a multiple of calendar years 2018 and 2019 estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
commonly referred to as EBITDA, adjusted to include stock-based compensation and to exclude one-time charges, which is referred
to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as adjusted EBITDA. The overall low to high calendar years 2018 and 2019 adjusted
EBITDA multiples observed for the selected publicly traded companies were 6.1x to 14.4x (with a mean of 10.0x and a median of
9.5x) and 5.7x to 12.8x (with a mean of 9.1x and a median of 8.7x), respectively.

BofA Merrill Lynch then applied (i) calendar year 2018 Non-GAAP EPS multiples of 14.0x to 17.0x derived from the selected
publicly traded companies to Convergys’ calendar year 2018 estimated non-GAAP EPS of $1.61 per share, and calendar year 2019
Non-GAAP EPS multiples of 12.5x to 16.5x derived from the selected publicly traded companies to Convergys’ calendar year 2019
estimated non-GAAP EPS of $1.63 per share, and (ii) calendar year 2018 adjusted EBITDA multiples of 6.0x to 9.0x derived from
the selected publicly traded companies to Convergys’ calendar year 2018 estimated adjusted EBITDA of $329.0 million, and
calendar year 2019 adjusted EBITDA multiples of 5.5x to 8.5x derived from the selected publicly traded companies to Convergys’
calendar year 2019 estimated adjusted EBITDA of $329.6 million. Estimated financial data of the selected publicly traded
companies were based on publicly available research analysts’ estimates, and estimated financial data of Convergys were based on
the adjusted Convergys forecasts. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges
for Convergys (rounded to the nearest $0.05 per share):

 
Implied Per Share Equity Value
Reference Range for Convergys

2018E Non-GAAP EPS $22.55 – $27.35
2019E Non-GAAP EPS $20.45 – $26.95
2018E Adjusted EBITDA $18.70 – $28.15
2019E Adjusted EBITDA $17.20 – $26.60

No company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Convergys. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of
this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the
companies to which Convergys was compared.

BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed transaction values, calculated as the enterprise value implied for the target company based on the
consideration payable in the selected transaction, as a multiple of the target company’s latest 12-month, or LTM, adjusted EBITDA.
The overall low to high multiples of the target companies’ LTM adjusted EBITDA for the selected transactions were 7.0x to 12.0x
(with a mean of 8.4x and a median of 7.8x). BofA Merrill Lynch then applied LTM EBITDA multiples of 8.0x to 10.0x, derived
from the selected transactions, to Convergys’ LTM adjusted EBITDA as of March 31, 2018. Estimated financial data of the selected
transactions were based on publicly available information. Convergys’ LTM adjusted EBITDA of $335.0 million as of March 31,
2018 was based on Convergys’ historical results. This analysis indicated the following approximate implied per share equity value
reference range for Convergys (rounded to the nearest $0.05 per share):

 
Implied Per Share Equity Value
Reference Range for Convergys

LTM Adjusted EBITDA $ 25.45 – $31.85 

No company, business or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to Convergys or the mergers.
Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex
considerations and judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the
acquisition or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions to which Convergys and the mergers were
compared.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of Convergys to calculate the
estimated present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that Convergys was forecasted to generate during
Convergys’ second through fourth quarters of fiscal 2018, and fiscal years 2019 through 2023, based on the adjusted Convergys
forecasts. BofA Merrill Lynch calculated terminal values for Convergys by applying terminal one-year forward multiples of 6.0x to
8.5x to Convergys’ fiscal year 2024 estimated adjusted EBITDA. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to
present value as of March 31, 2018 based on a mid-year convention using discount rates ranging from 7.75% to 9.50%, which were
based on an estimate of Convergys’ weighted average cost of capital. From the resulting enterprise values,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BofA Merrill Lynch deducted net debt as of March 31, 2018 to derive aggregate implied equity values for Convergys, and then
calculated implied per-share equity values using the treasury stock method. This analysis indicated an approximate implied per
share equity value reference range for Convergys of $21.10 to $29.00 (rounded to the nearest $0.05 per share).

BofA Merrill Lynch also performed a discounted cash flow analysis based on the cost savings to calculate the present value of
the after-tax potential expense synergies (less the costs to achieve such synergies) that were forecasted by SYNNEX management to
be generated following the consummation of the mergers. BofA Merrill Lynch calculated terminal values for the potential expense
synergies by applying terminal one-year forward multiples of 6.0x to 8.5x to calendar year 2024 potential expense synergies as
estimated in the cost savings. The after-tax potential expense synergies and terminal values were then discounted to present value as
of March 31, 2018 based on a mid-year convention using discount rates ranging from 7.75% to 9.00%, which were based on an
estimate of Convergys’ weighted average cost of capital, and reduced to a per-share basis using the treasury stock method. This
analysis indicated an approximate implied per-share value of potential expense synergies ranging from $7.83 to $11.23 per
Convergys share. BofA Merrill Lynch then added the approximate implied per-share value of the potential expense synergies to the
approximate implied per share equity value reference range for Convergys derived from the discounted cash flow analysis
(excluding expense synergies) as described above, to derive an approximate implied per share equity value reference range for
Convergys, including expense synergies, ranging from $28.95 to $40.25 per Convergys common share (rounded to the nearest $0.05
per share).

Summary of Material SYNNEX Financial Analyses

Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed publicly available financial and stock market
information for SYNNEX and the following eight publicly traded companies in the IT distribution industry:
• CDW Corporation • Presidio, Inc.
• Arrow Electronics, Inc. • Insight Enterprises, Inc.
• Avnet, Inc. • ScanSource, Inc.
• Tech Data Corporation • PC Connection, Inc.

BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed, among other things, per share equity values, based on closing stock prices on June 27, 2018, of
the selected publicly traded companies as a multiple of calendar years 2018 and 2019 estimated Non-GAAP EPS. The overall low to
high calendar year 2018 and 2019 estimated Non-GAAP EPS multiples observed for the selected publicly traded companies were
7.9x to 17.2x (with a mean of 11.4x and a median of 10.9x) and 7.5x to 15.6x (with a mean of 10.4x and a median of 10.2x),
respectively. BofA Merrill Lynch also reviewed enterprise values of the selected publicly traded companies, calculated as equity
values based on closing stock prices on June 27, 2018, plus debt, and less cash, as a multiple of calendar years 2018 and 2019
estimated adjusted EBITDA. The overall low to high calendar years 2018 and 2019 adjusted EBITDA multiples observed for the
selected publicly traded companies were 5.8x to 13.3x (with a mean of 8.5x and a median of 7.8x) and 5.5x to 12.4x (with a mean of
8.0x and a median of 7.3x), respectively.

2019E Adjusted EBITDA $84.75 – $154.20

No company used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to SYNNEX. Accordingly, an evaluation of the results of
this analysis is not entirely mathematical. Rather, this analysis involves complex considerations and judgments concerning
differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the
companies to which SYNNEX was compared.

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. BofA Merrill Lynch performed a discounted cash flow analysis of SYNNEX to calculate the
estimated present value of the standalone unlevered, after-tax free cash flows that SYNNEX was forecasted to generate during
SYNNEX’ second through fourth quarters of fiscal 2018, and fiscal years 2019 through 2023, based on the SYNNEX forecasts.
BofA Merrill Lynch calculated terminal values for SYNNEX by applying terminal one-year forward multiples of 6.0x to 9.5x to
SYNNEX’ fiscal year 2024 estimated adjusted EBITDA. The cash flows and terminal values were then discounted to present value
as of March 31, 2018 based on a mid-year convention using discount rates ranging from 7.00% to 8.50%, which were based on an
estimate of SYNNEX’ weighted average cost of capital. From the resulting enterprise values, BofA Merrill Lynch deducted net debt
as of March 31, 2018 to derive aggregate implied aggregate equity values for SYNNEX, and then calculated implied per-share
equity values using the treasury stock method. This analysis indicated an approximate implied per share equity value reference
range for SYNNEX of $107.30 to $177.40 (rounded to the nearest $0.05 per share).

Pro Forma Analysis

Non-GAAP Accretion/Dilution Analysis. BofA Merrill Lynch reviewed the potential pro forma financial effect of the mergers
on SYNNEX’ calendar year 2019 through 2021 estimated adjusted EPS, taking into account the potential cost savings and other pro
forma effects of the mergers. Estimated financial data of SYNNEX were based on the SYNNEX forecasts and estimated financial
data of Convergys were based on the adjusted Convergys forecasts, and the pro forma effects of the mergers were based on
information provided by SYNNEX management including the cost savings. Based on the merger consideration, this analysis
indicated that the mergers could be accretive to SYNNEX’ estimated adjusted EPS for calendar years 2019 through 2021. The
actual results achieved by the combined company may vary from projected results and the variations may be material.

Analysis of Value Accretion/Dilution to SYNNEX Stockholders. Using the range of implied equity values calculated by BofA
Merrill Lynch for SYNNEX on a standalone basis, based on the discounted cash flow analysis described above under “—Summary
of Material SYNNEX Financial Analyses—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,” and for Convergys on a standalone basis and for the
cost savings, each based on the discounted cash flow analysis described above under “—Summary of Material Convergys Financial
Analyses—Discounted Cash Flow Analysis,” and taking into account the cash portion of the merger consideration to be paid to
Convergys shareholders in the proposed mergers and the additional shares of common stock of SYNNEX to be issued in the
proposed mergers, BofA Merrill Lynch calculated the illustrative intrinsic value accretion to SYNNEX

stockholders as a result of the proposed mergers. This analysis indicated illustrative accretion to SYNNEX’ estimated per share
equity value ranging from approximately positive 29%, based on the highest values implied for Convergys and the cost savings in
the discounted cash flow analysis referenced above and the lowest value implied for SYNNEX in the discounted cash flow analysis
referenced above, to negative 4%, based on the lowest values implied for Convergys and the cost savings in the discounted cash
flow analysis referenced above and the highest value implied for SYNNEX in the discounted cash flow analysis referenced above,
with mid-case accretion of approximately 9%. The actual results achieved by the combined company may vary from projected
results, and the variations may be material.

Other Factors

BofA Merrill Lynch also noted certain additional factors that were not considered part of BofA Merrill Lynch’s material
financial analyses with respect to its opinion but were referenced for informational purposes, including, among other things, the
following:

• historical trading prices of SYNNEX common stock and Convergys common shares during the two-year period ended
June 27, 2018, and quarterly reported revenue and non-GAAP EPS for both companies compared to expected results
(based on consensus Wall Street analyst estimates provided by public data sources) during that time period;

• historical trading prices of Convergys common shares during the 12-month period ended June 27, 2018, noting that the
low and high closing prices per share during such period were $21.47 and $26.65, respectively;

• historical trading prices of SYNNEX common stock during the 12-month period ended June 27, 2018, noting that the low
and high closing prices per share during such period were $95.31 and $140.70, respectively;

• one-year forward share price targets as of June 27, 2018 for Convergys common shares in available research analyst
reports, which ranged from $22.00 to $24.00 per share, with a mean of $23.50, and which BofA Merrill Lynch discounted
by one year to present value as of June 27, 2018 utilizing a discount rate of 9.0% (based on an estimate of Convergys’ cost
of equity), resulting in present values ranging from approximately $20.20 to $22.00 per share (rounded to the nearest
$0.05 per share);

• one-year forward share price targets as of June 27, 2018 for SYNNEX common stock in available research analyst reports,
which ranged from $130.00 to $160.00 per share, with a mean of $139.63, and which BofA Merrill Lynch discounted by
one year to present value as of June 27, 2018 utilizing a discount rate of 9.0% (based on an estimate of SYNNEX’ cost of
equity), resulting in present values of approximately $119.25 to $146.80 per share (rounded to the nearest $0.05 per
share); and

• premiums offered in selected public technology company transactions announced in calendar years 2013–2017 and
through June 27, 2018.

Miscellaneous

As noted above, the discussion set forth above in the sections “—Summary of Material Convergys Financial Analyses,” “—
Summary of Material SYNNEX Financial Analyses” and “—Pro Forma Analysis” is a summary of the material financial analyses
presented by BofA Merrill Lynch to SYNNEX’ board of directors in connection with its opinion and is not a comprehensive
description of all analyses undertaken or factors considered by BofA Merrill Lynch in connection with its opinion. The preparation
of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant
methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion
is not readily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. BofA Merrill Lynch believes that its analyses summarized
above must be considered as a whole. BofA Merrill Lynch further believes that selecting portions of its analyses and the factors
considered or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative
description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying BofA Merrill Lynch’s
analyses and opinion. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary above is not meant to indicate that
such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

In performing its analyses, BofA Merrill Lynch considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions
and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of SYNNEX and Convergys. The estimates of the future performance of
SYNNEX and Convergys in or underlying BofA Merrill Lynch’s analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or actual
future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those estimates or those suggested by BofA Merrill Lynch’s
analyses. These analyses were prepared solely as part of BofA Merrill Lynch’s analysis of the fairness, from a financial point of
view, to SYNNEX of the merger consideration to be paid by SYNNEX in the mergers and were provided to SYNNEX’ board of
directors in connection with the delivery of BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion. The analyses do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect
the prices at which a company might actually be sold or the prices at which any securities have traded or may trade at any time in
the future. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the ranges of valuations resulting from, any particular analysis described above
are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty and should not be taken to be BofA Merrill Lynch’s view of the actual values of
SYNNEX or Convergys.

The type and amount of consideration payable in the mergers was determined through negotiations between SYNNEX and
Convergys, rather than by any financial advisor, and was approved by SYNNEX’ board of directors. The decision to enter into the
merger agreement was solely that of SYNNEX’ board of directors. As described above, BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion and analyses
were only one of many factors considered by SYNNEX’ board of directors in its evaluation of the proposed mergers and should not
be viewed as determinative of the views of SYNNEX’ board of directors or management with respect to the proposed mergers or the
merger consideration.

SYNNEX has agreed to pay BofA Merrill Lynch for its services in connection with the mergers an aggregate fee of
$3,250,000, all of which was payable upon delivery of its opinion. BofA Merrill Lynch and certain of its affiliates also are
participating in the financing for the mergers, including acting as joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner in connection with
SYNNEX’ $1.8 billion bridge financing and any takeout financing associated with such bridge financing, for which services BofA
Merrill Lynch and its affiliates will receive fees estimated to be approximately $6 million, contingent on the consummation of the
mergers. SYNNEX also has agreed to reimburse BofA Merrill Lynch for its expenses incurred in connection with BofA Merrill
Lynch’s engagement and to indemnify BofA Merrill Lynch, any controlling person of BofA Merrill Lynch and each of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates against specified liabilities, including liabilities under the federal
securities laws.

BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates comprise a full service securities firm and commercial bank engaged in securities,
commodities and derivatives trading, foreign exchange and other brokerage activities, and principal investing as well as providing
investment, corporate and private banking, asset and investment management, financing and financial advisory services and other
commercial services and products to a wide range of companies, governments and individuals. In the ordinary course of their
businesses, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates may invest on a principal basis or on behalf of customers or manage funds that
invest, make or hold long or short positions, finance positions or trade or otherwise effect transactions in equity, debt or other
securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of SYNNEX, Convergys and certain of
their respective affiliates.

BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide
investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to SYNNEX and have received or in the future may receive
compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted or acting as administrative agent, joint bookrunner and
co-lead arranger for, and as a lender (including a swing-line and letter of credit lender) under, SYNNEX’ $1.8 billion term loan and
revolving credit facility, (ii) having provided or providing certain derivatives and/or foreign exchange trading services to SYNNEX
and (iii) having provided or providing certain treasury services and products to SYNNEX. From May 1, 2016 through April 30,
2018, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from SYNNEX and its affiliates of approximately $18
million for investment and corporate banking services.

In addition, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may
provide investment banking, commercial banking and other financial services to Convergys and have received or in the future may
receive compensation for the rendering of these services, including (i) having acted or acting as joint bookrunner and co-lead
arranger for, and as a lender under, Convergys’ $515 million term

May 1, 2016 through April 30, 2018, BofA Merrill Lynch and its affiliates derived aggregate revenues from Convergys and its
affiliates of approximately $1.5 million for investment and corporate banking services.

Ownership of SYNNEX Common Stock After the Mergers

Based on the number of Convergys common shares outstanding as of August 23, 2018, the most recent practicable date for
which such information was available, SYNNEX expects to issue approximately 11,277,434 shares of SYNNEX common stock to
Convergys shareholders pursuant to the mergers and up to approximately 801,000 shares of its common stock which may be issued
upon conversion of the convertible debentures. The actual number of shares of SYNNEX common stock to be issued pursuant to the
mergers will be determined at the completion of the mergers based on the exchange ratio and the number of Convergys common
shares outstanding at such time. Based on the number of Convergys common shares outstanding as of August 23, 2018, and the
number of shares of SYNNEX common stock outstanding as of August 23, 2018, the most recent practicable date for which such
information was available, it is expected that, immediately after completion of the mergers, former Convergys shareholders will own
approximately 22% of the outstanding SYNNEX common stock excluding the potential issuance of shares upon conversion of the
convertible debentures.

In addition, as of June 30, 2018, $125.0 million of aggregate principal amount of the convertible debentures were outstanding.
Under the terms of the convertible debentures, from and after the closing of the mergers, the convertible debentures will no longer
be convertible on the basis of Convergys common shares and will instead be convertible on the basis of the consideration paid
pursuant to the mergers. The convertible debentures will be obligations of Merger Sub II, the surviving company in the subsequent
merger following the mergers (until their conversion, repurchase, redemption, maturity or other cancellation).

Prior to the closing of the mergers, upon conversion of the convertible debentures in accordance with the terms of the existing
indenture, Convergys will (i) pay cash up to $1,000 principal amount in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of the convertible
debentures being converted and (ii) to the extent the sum of the daily conversion values (calculated as described below) exceeds
such principal amount, pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, Convergys common shares or a combination thereof (at its election)
in respect of the excess, by delivering to holders in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of the convertible debentures being
converted a “settlement amount” equal to the sum of the daily settlement amounts for each of the 20 trading days during the
observation period. If the sum of the daily conversion values for each of the 20 trading days in the applicable observation period is
less than $1,000 principal amount, converting holders will receive less than $1,000 principal amount in respect of each $1,000
principal amount of convertible debentures converted.

If a conversion is made prior to the 22nd scheduled trading day preceding the closing of the mergers, a holder would receive the
sum of the following for each trading day in a 20 trading day observation period that begins on the third trading day after the holder
gives notice of conversion: (a) cash equal to the lesser of $50 and the daily conversion value, and (b) if the daily conversion value
exceeds $50, either cash, Convergys common shares or a combination thereof with a value equal to such excess. Convergys must
make its election with respect to the percentage of cash, if any, to be delivered for any excess conversion value over the principal
amount no later than the second business day immediately following the related conversion date, and may only choose one cash
percentage in respect of each observation period. The “daily conversion value” is 1/20 of the volume-weighted average price on the
relevant day multiplied by the number of Convergys common shares equal to the conversion rate for the convertible debentures on
the relevant day, determined as described in the existing indenture.

If a conversion is made on or after the 22nd scheduled trading day preceding the closing of the mergers, a converting holder
would receive conversion consideration calculated using the formula described in the previous paragraph, but each reference to
“common stock” in that formula would refer to a Convergys common share only prior to the closing of the mergers and would
instead refer to a unit of reference property after the closing of the mergers. Each unit of reference property would consist of (a) the
amount of cash and (b) the number of shares of SYNNEX common stock that a holder of one Convergys common share would have
received in the mergers. As a result, units of reference property would be used in calculating the conversion value deliverable and in
settling any portion of the conversion value that would have been settled in Convergys common shares prior to the mergers.
Additionally, the conversion rate applicable to the convertible debentures that are converted

TABLE OF CONTENTS

in connection with the closing of the mergers, as described in the following paragraph, will be temporarily increased, as described
below, creating an incentive for holders to convert.

Under the terms of the convertible debentures, the mergers will constitute a fundamental change and a make-whole
fundamental change. As a result, holders of the convertible debentures will be permitted to choose (i) to convert their convertible
debentures at a temporarily increased conversion rate, (ii) to require Convergys to buy back their convertible debentures for a price
equal to their principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest to but excluding the repurchase date, or (iii) to continue holding
their convertible debentures. If the closing of the mergers occurs, the holders of the convertible debentures would be expected to
exercise the right to convert their debentures in accordance with their terms at a temporarily increased conversion rate shortly
following the closing of the mergers (although the holders’ actual decisions will depend upon their judgments based on the
prevailing market conditions).

If holders of the convertible debentures choose to convert in order to receive the temporarily increased conversion rate
calculated as set forth in the existing indenture, the exact conversion consideration they receive will depend upon (x) the date on
which the mergers are consummated, (y) the market price of Convergys common shares during the 5-trading day period preceding
such date and (z) the market price of SYNNEX common stock during the related observation period. Assuming, for illustrative
purposes, that (a) the closing of the mergers occurs on October 4, 2018, (b) each Convergys common share is converted into the
right to receive $13.25 in cash, without interest, and 0.1237 shares of SYNNEX common stock in the mergers, (c) the applicable
conversion rate for the convertible debentures is 91.5008 Convergys common shares for each $1,000 principal amount of the
convertible debentures and all holders of the convertible debentures convert their convertible debentures on the day after the closing
date of the mergers, (d) the market price of Convergys common shares during the 5-trading day period preceding the closing of the
mergers is $25.18 (the implied value of the merger consideration on August 23, 2018), (e) the market price of SYNNEX common
stock is $96.40 (its closing price on August 23, 2018) throughout the observation period during which the conversion consideration
will be calculated following holders’ elections to convert, and (f) SYNNEX elects to cause Merger Sub II, as successor to
Convergys, to settle all conversions with all cash, then an aggregate of $288 million in cash would be deliverable in respect of the
convertible debentures on the third business day following the 22nd trading day following conversion. Alternatively, assuming, for
illustrative purposes, the same facts as in the prior sentence except that SYNNEX elects to cause Merger Sub II, as successor to
Convergys, to settle conversions with the maximum amount of SYNNEX shares deliverable, then an aggregate of $211 million in
cash, together with approximately 801,000 shares of SYNNEX common stock, would be deliverable in respect of the convertible
debentures on the third business day following the 22nd trading day following conversion. The potential amounts of consideration
deliverable upon conversion of the convertible debentures that are set forth in this paragraph are illustrative only and the value of
the consideration deliverable in respect of the convertible debentures that are converted in connection with the mergers may be
higher or lower.

Unaudited Prospective Financial Information

Neither SYNNEX nor Convergys generally publishes its business plans and strategies or makes external disclosures of its
anticipated financial position or results of operations, other than, in each case, providing, from time to time, estimated ranges of
certain expected financial results and operational metrics for the current year and certain future years in their respective regular
earnings press releases and other investor materials.

Convergys Projections

Convergys does not as a matter of course make public long-term projections as to future revenues, earnings or other results,
except for annual constant currency revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted earnings per
share, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as adjusted EPS, guidance, due to, among other reasons, the
uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. In connection with the mergers, Convergys’ management prepared and
provided to Convergys’ board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the mergers, and to Centerview, its financial advisor,
in connection with its financial analyses described above under the section “—Opinion of Convergys’ Financial Advisor,” certain
nonpublic, internal financial projections regarding Convergys’ future operations for fiscal years 2018 through 2022, which are
referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Convergys financial projections, and are comprised of the Convergys
alternative projections and the Convergys base case projections (as defined below). As described below, certain of the Convergys
financial projections were also provided to SYNNEX and

its financial advisor, BofA Merrill Lynch, in connection with their respective financial analyses and BofA Merrill Lynch’s opinion
and such Convergys financial projections as were provided to BofA Merrill Lynch are referred to in the section of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus under the caption “—Opinion of SYNNEX’ Financial Advisor” and “—Opinion of Convergys’ Financial
Advisor” as the Convergys forecasts. Convergys has included below a summary of the Convergys financial projections for the
purpose of providing shareholders and investors access to certain nonpublic information that was furnished to certain parties in
connection with the mergers. Such information may not be appropriate for other purposes, and is not included to influence your
decision, if you are a Convergys shareholder, to vote for the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, the proposal to adjourn from
time to time the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the
merger agreement at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof and the proposal to
approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named
executive officers in connection with the mergers, or, if you are a SYNNEX stockholder, to vote for the stock issuance or to approve
the adjournment of the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve
the stock issuance at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting.

The Convergys financial projections were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor were they prepared with a
view toward compliance with published guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for
preparation and presentations of financial projections. This information is prospective and should not be relied upon as being
necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this joint proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on the prospective financial information. The Convergys financial projections have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of,
Convergys’ management. Neither the independent registered public accounting firm of Convergys, nor any independent
accountants, have examined, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to the Convergys financial projections and,
accordingly, the independent registered accounting firm of Convergys does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on
such projections or their achievability, and assumes no responsibility for, and disclaims any association with, the Convergys
financial projections. The independent registered public accounting firm’s report, contained in Convergys’ Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, relates to
Convergys’ historical financial information. It does not extend to the Convergys financial projections and should not be read to do
so. Furthermore, the Convergys financial projections do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date
they were prepared.

While presented with numeric specificity, the Convergys financial projections were based on numerous variables and
assumptions (including, but not limited to, the assumptions that (1) Convergys would achieve low single-digit revenue growth in the
fourth quarter of 2018 and return to full-year revenue growth in 2019 based, in part, on the diminishing effect of declining revenues
with Convergys’ largest communication client and (2) this revenue growth would contribute to margin expansion) that are
inherently subjective and uncertain and are beyond the control of Convergys’ management. Important factors that may affect actual
results and cause the Convergys financial projections to not be achieved include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties
relating to Convergys’ and SYNNEX’ businesses, industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other
factors described in the sections “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.” The
Convergys financial projections also reflect numerous variables, expectations and assumptions available at the time they were
prepared as to certain business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those
contained in the Convergys financial projections. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the projected results summarized
below will be realized. Convergys shareholders and SYNNEX stockholders are urged to review the most recent SEC filings of
Convergys for a description of the reported and anticipated results of operations and financial condition and capital resources during
2018, including in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Convergys
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which are
incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The inclusion of a summary of the Convergys financial projections in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be
regarded as an indication that any of Convergys, SYNNEX or their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other
representatives considered the Convergys financial projections to necessarily be predictive of actual future events, and the
Convergys financial projections should not be relied upon as such nor

should the information contained in the Convergys financial projections be considered appropriate for other purposes. None of
Convergys, SYNNEX or their respective officers, directors, affiliates, advisors or other representatives can give you any assurance
that actual results will not differ materially from the Convergys financial projections. Convergys undertakes no obligation to update
or otherwise revise or reconcile the Convergys financial projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date the Convergys
financial projections were generated or to reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions
underlying these projections are shown to be in error.

Convergys and SYNNEX may calculate certain non-GAAP financial metrics, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free
cash flow, using different methodologies. Consequently, the financial metrics presented in each company’s prospective financial
information disclosures and in the sections of this joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the opinions of the financial
advisors to Convergys and SYNNEX may not be directly comparable to one another.

Convergys has not made and makes no representation to SYNNEX or any of its stockholders, in the merger agreement or
otherwise, concerning the Convergys financial projections or regarding Convergys’ ultimate performance compared to the
information contained in the Convergys financial projections or that the projected results will be achieved. Convergys urges all
shareholders to review Convergys’ most recent SEC filings for a description of Convergys’ reported financial results.

Convergys Base Case Projections. The following is a summary of the unaudited Convergys prospective financial information
for calendar years 2018 through 2022 that was prepared by Convergys’ management to reflect Convergys’ 2018 budget and a base
case assumption regarding year-over-year revenue growth in 2019 and 2020, as well as numerous other variables and assumptions,
including those discussed above, which are referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the Convergys base case
projections. The Convergys base case projections were prepared by Convergys’ management in March 2018, and included budgeted
numbers for 2018, as well as projected numbers for 2019 through 2022. The Convergys base case projections are based solely on the
information available to Convergys’ management at those times. The Convergys base case projections do not give effect to the
mergers.

The Convergys base case projections were provided to Convergys’ board of directors and its financial advisor, Centerview. The
Convergys base case projections of revenue and adjusted EBITDA, for calendar year 2018 only, were also provided to SYNNEX
and its financial advisor, BofA Merrill Lynch. The following table presents a summary of the Convergys base case projections, as
prepared by Convergys’ management, with all figures rounded to the nearest million.
(Dollars in millions) 2018E(1) 2019E 2020E 2021E 2022E
Revenue $ 2,690 $ 2,717 $ 2,785 $ 2,854 $2,926 
Adjusted EBITDA(2) $ 340 $ 349 $ 363 $ 372 $ 381 
Adjusted Free Cash Flow(3) $ 185 $ 215 $ 210 $ 217 $ 224 

(1) The budgeted numbers for 2018 that were included in the Convergys base case projections that were provided in March 2018 to Convergys’ board of directors
and its financial advisor, Centerview, and later, to SYNNEX and its financial advisor, BofA Merrill Lynch, were updated in June 2018 to take into account
actual results, to the extent then known. These updated numbers for 2018 reflected (a) estimated revenue of $2,714 million and (b) estimated adjusted EBITDA
of $335 million. An updated estimated 2018 adjusted free cash flow of $183 million was also provided to Convergys’ board of directors and Centerview.

(2) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that Convergys’ management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of Convergys’ business.
Convergys’ management defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA – which represents income from continuing operations, net of tax, plus interest expense, tax
expense, depreciation and amortization – excluding certain acquisition-related costs and other discrete items, including pension settlement charges and charges
associated with company-wide restructuring initiatives.

(3) Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that Convergys’ management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of Convergys’ business.
Convergys’ management defines adjusted free cash flow as free cash flow – which represents cash flows from operations less capital expenditures (net of
proceeds from disposal) – excluding certain acquisition-related cash payments associated with investment activity.

Convergys Alternative Projections. The following is a summary of the unaudited Convergys prospective financial information
for calendar years 2018 through 2022 that was prepared by Convergys’ management to reflect more optimistic assumptions
regarding year-over-year revenue growth in 2019 and 2020, as well as numerous other variables and assumptions, including those
discussed above, which are referred to in this joint

Convergys’ management in March 2018, and are based solely on the information available to Convergys’ management at that time.
The Convergys alternative projections do not give effect to the mergers.

The Convergys alternative projections for calendar years 2018 through 2020 only were also provided to SYNNEX and its
financial advisor, BofA Merrill Lynch. The Convergys alternative projections for calendar years 2018 through 2022 were provided

Adjusted Free Cash Flow(3) $ 185 $ 195 $ 210 $ 226 $ 242 

(1) In June 2018, Convergys provided updated projections for 2018 to SYNNEX and its financial advisor, BofA Merrill Lynch, to take into account actual results,
to the extent then known. These updated numbers for 2018 reflected (a) estimated revenue of $2,714 million and (b) estimated adjusted EBITDA of $335

General

Important factors that may affect actual results and cause Convergys’ financial projections not to be achieved include risks and
uncertainties relating to Convergys’ businesses (including its ability to achieve its strategic goals, objectives and targets over
applicable periods; the customer management industry; the regulatory environment; general business and economic conditions; and
other factors described under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” as well as the
risk factors with respect to Convergys’ business contained in its most recent SEC filings, which readers are urged to review, which
may be found as described under “Where You Can Find More Information”). In addition, Convergys’ financial projections cover
multiple future years, and such information by its nature is less reliable in predicting each successive year. Convergys’ financial
projections also do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared and do
not give effect to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the mergers, and also do not take into account
the effect of any failure of the mergers to be completed. Convergys’ financial projections also reflect assumptions as to certain
business decisions that are subject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in Convergys’
financial projections. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Convergys’ financial projections will be realized or that actual
results will not be significantly lower than projected.

The inclusion of Convergys’ financial projections in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded as an
indication that any of Convergys or its affiliates, advisors or representatives considered Convergys’ financial projections to
be predictive of actual future events, and Convergys’ financial projections should not be relied on as such. None of
Convergys or its affiliates, advisors, officers, employees, directors or representatives can give you any assurance that actual
results will not differ from Convergys’ financial projections, and none of those persons undertakes any obligation to update
or otherwise revise or reconcile Convergys’ financial projections to reflect circumstances existing after the date Convergys’
financial projections were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the
assumptions underlying Convergys’ financial projections are shown to be in error. Convergys does not intend to publicly
update or make any other revision to Convergys’ financial projections. None of Convergys or any of its affiliates, advisors,
officers, employees, directors or representatives has made or makes any representation to any SYNNEX stockholder,
Convergys shareholder or any other person regarding Convergys’ ultimate performance compared to Convergys’ financial
projections or that the results reflected therein will be achieved. Convergys has not made any

Certain SYNNEX Prospective Financial Information

SYNNEX Financial Projections

SYNNEX’ management does not as a matter of course publish detailed or long-term public forecasts or projections as to its
future financial performance beyond the then current quarter due to the unpredictability of the underlying assumptions and estimates
and uncertainty inherent in SYNNEX’ business. However, in connection with the evaluation of the mergers, SYNNEX’
management prepared certain long-term illustrative financial projections of SYNNEX for fiscal years 2018 through 2020 and
prepared, or directed the preparation of, and approved, extrapolations thereto for fiscal years 2021 through 2023, which are referred
to collectively in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the SYNNEX financial projections. Such financial projections reflected
SYNNEX management’s best estimates as to SYNNEX’ future performance and were prepared on a stand-alone basis assuming
SYNNEX would continue as an independent company without giving effect to the mergers. The SYNNEX financial projections
were provided to SYNNEX’ board of directors in connection with its evaluation of the proposed transaction and were also provided,
in whole or in part, to BofA Merrill Lynch for the purpose of their financial analyses and opinion, and SYNNEX directed BofA
Merrill Lynch to use and rely on the SYNNEX financial projections for such purpose, and such SYNNEX financial projections as
were so provided to BofA Merrill Lynch are referred to in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “—Opinion of
SYNNEX’ Financial Advisor” as the SYNNEX forecasts.

The SYNNEX financial projections were developed from historical financial statements and reflect numerous assumptions and
estimates that SYNNEX management made in good faith at the time such financial projections were prepared, including, without
limitation, as to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future
events, and other factors described below in “—General.” These assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain, may be beyond
the control of SYNNEX or any other person, were made as of the date the SYNNEX financial projections were prepared, and may
not be reflective of actual results, either since the date such projections were prepared, now or in the future, in light of changed
circumstances, economic conditions, or other developments.

The following table presents a summary of the SYNNEX financial projections:
(Dollars in millions) FY2018E FY2019E FY2020E FY2021E FY2022E FY2023E
SYNNEX revenue $ 19,478 $ 20,452 $ 21,597 $ 22,568 $ 23,584 $ 24,645 
SYNNEX adjusted EBITDA(1) $ 736 $ 806 $ 873 $ 903 $ 943 $ 986 

Less: taxes $ (177) $ (193) $ (211) $ (218) $ (230) $ (242)

Less: capital expenditures $ (85) $ (90) $ (95) $ (99) $ (102) $ (105)

SYNNEX unlevered free cash flow(2)(3) $ 170 $ 324 $ 329 $ 526 $ 518 $ 512 

(1) SYNNEX adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that SYNNEX management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of SYNNEX.
SYNNEX defines adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and excludes acquisition-related and integration
expenses, restructuring costs, the amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects thereon.

(2) SYNNEX unlevered free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that SYNNEX management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of SYNNEX.
SYNNEX calculates unlevered free cash flow as adjusted EBITDA, less taxes, less changes in working capital, and less capital expenditures.

(3) Numbers may not add up due to rounding.

The SYNNEX financial projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus only because such information was provided to SYNNEX’ board of directors and provided, in whole or in
part, to BofA Merrill Lynch for the purpose of its financial analyses and opinion.

Adjusted Convergys Financial Projections

In connection with the mergers, Convergys provided the Convergys financial projections to SYNNEX and, to the extent set
forth under “—Convergys Financial Projections,” to BofA Merrill Lynch. In connection with its

evaluation of the mergers and the preparation of the SYNNEX projected cost savings described below, SYNNEX made certain
adjustments to the assumptions and estimates underlying the Convergys financial projections for fiscal years 2018 through 2021 and
prepared, or directed the preparation of, and approved, extrapolations thereto for fiscal years 2022 through 2023, which are referred
to collectively in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the adjusted Convergys financial projections. Such adjustments were made
by SYNNEX’ management in light of, among other things, the due diligence SYNNEX conducted on Convergys, the potential
impact of the transaction pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and other effects of the transaction, and certain
macroeconomic and industry trends. The adjusted Convergys financial projections reflected SYNNEX management’s best estimates
as to Convergys’ future performance. The adjusted Convergys financial projections were provided to SYNNEX’ board of directors
in connection with its evaluation of the proposed transaction and were also provided, in whole or in part, to BofA Merrill Lynch for
purposes of their financial analyses and opinion, and SYNNEX directed BofA Merrill Lynch to use and rely on the adjusted
Convergys financial projections for such purpose, and such adjusted Convergys financial projections as were so provided to BofA
Merrill Lynch are referred to in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “—Opinion of SYNNEX’ Financial
Advisor” as the adjusted Convergys forecasts.

The following table presents a summary of the adjusted Convergys financial projections:
(Dollars in millions) FY2018E FY2019E FY2020E FY2021E FY2022E FY2023E
Convergys adjusted revenue $ 2,695 $ 2,732 $ 2,804 $ 2,891 $ 2,977 $ 3,067

Convergys adjusted unlevered free cash flow(1) $ 158 $ 168 $ 174 $ 183 $ 191 $ 202 

(1) Each of Convergys adjusted EBITDA and Convergys adjusted unlevered free cash flow has the meaning set forth above under “—Convergys Financial
projections.” Numbers may not add up due to rounding.

The adjusted Convergys financial projections were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus only because such information was provided to the board of directors of SYNNEX in connection with
its evaluation of the proposed transaction and were also provided, in whole or in part, to BofA Merrill Lynch for the purpose of its
financial analyses and opinion.

SYNNEX Projected Cost Savings

Additionally, in connection with its evaluation of the mergers, SYNNEX management prepared certain estimates of potential
cost savings and efficiencies anticipated by SYNNEX management to result from the mergers in the first three full years following
the completion of the mergers and thereafter, which are referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the SYNNEX
projected cost savings. The SYNNEX projected cost savings were provided to SYNNEX’ board of directors in connection with its
evaluation of the proposed transaction and were also provided, in whole or in part, to BofA Merrill Lynch for the purposes of their
financial analyses and opinion, and SYNNEX directed BofA Merrill Lynch to use and rely on the SYNNEX projected costs savings
for such purpose, and such SYNNEX projected cost savings as were so provided to BofA Merrill Lynch are referred to in the
section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “—Opinion of SYNNEX’ Financial Advisor” as the cost savings.

The following table presents a summary of the SYNNEX projected cost savings, which SYNNEX management anticipates
may accrue to the combined company, and assumes that the mergers are completed on December 31, 2018. The below information
is presented on a pre-tax basis:
(Dollars in millions) CY2019E CY2020E CY2021E **
SYNNEX projected cost savings* $ 50 $ 100 $ 150    

* Excludes the estimated cost of achieving such cost savings.

** In addition, SYNNEX’ management estimated 3% growth in the projected cost savings in each of 2022 and 2023.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The SYNNEX projected cost savings reflect numerous assumptions and reflected SYNNEX management’s best estimates as to
the potential cost savings and efficiencies of a combined company, which SYNNEX made in good faith. The SYNNEX projected
cost savings were not prepared with a view to public disclosure and are included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus only
because such information was provided, in whole or in part, to the board of directors of SYNNEX and to BofA Merrill Lynch for
the purpose of its financial analyses and opinion.

General

The SYNNEX financial projections, adjusted Convergys financial projections and SYNNEX projected cost savings, which are
referred to collectively in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the SYNNEX prospective financial information, were prepared by
SYNNEX’ management for internal use and were not prepared with a view to public disclosure, nor were they prepared with a view
toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information or generally accepted accounting principles. The
SYNNEX prospective financial information were prepared by, and are the responsibility of, SYNNEX management. No
independent registered public accounting firm has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled, or applied any agreed-upon procedures
with respect to the SYNNEX prospective financial information nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance
on such information or its achievability. The reports of SYNNEX’ independent registered public accounting firm incorporated by
reference into this joint proxy statement statement/prospectus relate to SYNNEX’ historical financial information and does not
extend to the SYNNEX prospective financial information, nor should it be read to do so.

While the SYNNEX prospective financial information are presented with numeric specificity, they reflect numerous
assumptions and estimates that SYNNEX management made in good faith at the time such projections were prepared with respect
to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and other future events, as well as
the ability to achieve the projected cost savings, the levels of information technology/consumer electronics and outsourced business
services spending, competitive conditions in the industry and market acceptance of SYNNEX products and services. These
assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain, may be beyond the control of SYNNEX or any other person, were made as of
the date the SYNNEX prospective financial information was prepared, and may not be reflective of actual results, either since the
date such projections were prepared, now or in the future, in light of changed circumstances, economic conditions, or other
developments.

Important factors that may affect actual results and cause the SYNNEX prospective financial information not to be achieved
include risks and uncertainties relating to SYNNEX’ and Convergys’ businesses, including their abilities to achieve their respective
strategic goals, objectives, targets and cost savings over applicable periods, customer demand for products, successful and timely
development of products, an evolving competitive landscape, rapid technological change, general business, economic and political
conditions and other factors described under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,”
as well as the risk factors with respect to SYNNEX’ and Convergys’ respective businesses contained in their most recent SEC
filings, which readers are urged to review, which may be found as described under “Where You Can Find More Information”. In
addition, the SYNNEX prospective financial information covers multiple future years, and such information by its nature is less
reliable in predicting each successive year. The SYNNEX prospective financial information also do not take into account any
circumstances or events occurring after the date on which they were prepared and do not give effect to the transactions contemplated
by the merger agreement, including the mergers, and also do not take into account the effect of any failure of the mergers to be
completed. The SYNNEX prospective financial information also reflects assumptions as to certain business decisions that are
subject to change. As a result, actual results may differ materially from those contained in the SYNNEX prospective financial
information. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the SYNNEX prospective financial information will be realized or that
actual results will not be significantly lower than projected. The SYNNEX prospective financial information is not included in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus to induce any stockholder or shareholder, as applicable, to vote in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement, the approval, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, of the compensation that will or may be paid or provided by
Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers or in favor of the stock issuance or any other proposal.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The inclusion of the SYNNEX prospective financial information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be
regarded as an indication that SYNNEX or any of its affiliates, advisors or representatives considered the SYNNEX
prospective financial information to be predictive of actual future events, and the SYNNEX prospective financial
information should not be relied on as such. Neither SYNNEX nor any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, employees,
directors or representatives can give you any assurance that actual results will not differ from the SYNNEX prospective
financial information, and none of those persons undertakes any obligation to update or otherwise revise or reconcile the
SYNNEX prospective financial information to reflect circumstances existing after the date such projections were prepared
or to reflect the occurrence of future events even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying such projections
are shown to be in error. SYNNEX does not intend to publicly update or make any other revision to the SYNNEX
prospective financial information. Neither SYNNEX nor any of its affiliates, advisors, officers, employees, directors or
representatives makes any representation to any SYNNEX stockholder or any other person regarding SYNNEX’ and
Convergys’ ultimate performance compared to the SYNNEX prospective financial information or that the results reflected
therein will be achieved. SYNNEX has not made any representation to Convergys, in the merger agreement or otherwise,
concerning the SYNNEX prospective financial information. For the reasons described above, readers of this joint proxy
statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue, if any, reliance on the SYNNEX prospective financial information.

Regulatory Approvals Required for the Mergers

General

Prior to the closing of the mergers, SYNNEX, the Merger Subs and Convergys have agreed to use their respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
any applicable laws to consummate and make effective the mergers as promptly as practicable, including (i) preparing and filing all
forms, registrations and notifications required to be filed to consummate the mergers, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to satisfy the
conditions to consummating the mergers, (iii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining)
any consent, authorization, expiration or termination of a waiting period, permit, order or approval of, waiver or any exemption by,
any governmental authority (including furnishing all information and documentary material required under the HSR Act) required to
be obtained or made by SYNNEX, either Merger Sub, Convergys or any of their respective subsidiaries in connection with the
mergers or the taking of any action contemplated by the merger agreement, (iv) using reasonable best efforts to defend any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the
mergers and (v) the execution and delivery of any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate the mergers and to
fully carry out the purposes of the merger agreement.

The obligation of each of SYNNEX, Convergys and the Merger Subs to effect the mergers is conditioned upon, among other
things, the antitrust approvals having been obtained or filed or having occurred. See “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to
Completion of the Mergers.”

Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission and Other U.S. Antitrust Authorities

Under the HSR Act, certain transactions, including the mergers, may not be completed unless certain waiting period
requirements have expired or been terminated. The HSR Act provides that each party must file a pre-merger notification with the
FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of
a 30-calendar-day waiting period following the parties’ filings of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early
termination of that waiting period. If the DOJ or the FTC issues a Request for Additional Information and Documentary Material
prior to the expiration of the initial waiting period, the parties must observe a second 30-calendar-day waiting period, which would
begin to run only after both parties have substantially complied with the request for additional information, unless the waiting period
is terminated earlier.

SYNNEX and Convergys each filed its respective required HSR notification and report with respect to the mergers on July 19,
2018, and the request for early termination of the HSR Act waiting period was granted effective on July 30, 2018. Both before and
after the termination of the waiting period, the FTC and Antitrust Division of the DOJ retain the authority to challenge the mergers
on antitrust grounds.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

At any time before or after the mergers are completed, either the DOJ or the FTC could take action under the antitrust laws in
opposition to the mergers, including seeking to enjoin completion of the mergers, condition approval of the mergers upon the
divestiture of assets of SYNNEX, Convergys or their respective subsidiaries or impose restrictions on SYNNEX’ post-merger
operations. In addition, U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in
the public interest including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin completion of the mergers or permitting completion subject to
regulatory concessions or conditions. Private parties also may seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under some
circumstances.

Other Governmental Approvals

In addition to the completion of the mergers being conditioned upon the expiration or early termination of the waiting period
relating to the mergers under the HSR Act, it is also conditioned upon the expiration or termination of the merger control waiting
period under certain foreign antitrust laws. SYNNEX, the Merger Subs and Convergys will submit these merger control filings as
promptly as practicable.

Similar to the DOJ or FTC, the antitrust authorities in these other jurisdictions can take actions under their respective antitrust
laws in opposition to the mergers, including seeking to enjoin completion of the mergers, condition approval of the mergers upon
the divestiture of assets of SYNNEX, Convergys or their respective subsidiaries or impose restrictions on SYNNEX’ post-merger
operations.

Timing; Challenges by Governmental and Other Entities

There can be no assurance that any of the regulatory approvals described above will be obtained and, if obtained, there can be
no assurance as to the timing of any approvals, the ability to obtain the approvals on satisfactory terms or the absence of any
litigation challenging such approvals. In addition, there can be no assurance that any of the governmental or other entities described
above, including the DOJ, the FTC, and private parties, will not challenge the mergers on antitrust or competition grounds and, if
such a challenge is made, there can be no assurance as to its result.

Subject to certain conditions, if the mergers are not completed on or before the end date, either SYNNEX or Convergys may
terminate the merger agreement. See “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement.”

Securities and Exchange Commission

In connection with the stock issuance, SYNNEX must file a registration statement with the SEC under the Securities Act, of
which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, that is declared effective by the SEC.

Appraisal Rights for Convergys Shareholders

If the merger agreement is adopted by Convergys shareholders, Convergys shareholders who do not vote in favor of the
adoption of the merger agreement and who properly demand payment of fair cash value of their shares are entitled to certain
dissenters’ rights pursuant to Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL. Section 1701.85 generally provides that Convergys
shareholders will not be entitled to such rights without strict compliance with the procedures set forth in Section 1701.85, and
failure to take any one of the required steps may result in the termination or waiver of such rights. Specifically, any Convergys
shareholder who is a record holder of Convergys common shares on August 31, 2018, the record date for the Convergys special
meeting, and whose shares are not voted in favor of the adoption of merger agreement may be entitled to be paid the “fair cash
value” of such common shares after the completion of the initial merger. To be entitled to such payment, a shareholder must deliver
to Convergys a written demand for payment of the fair cash value of the shares held by such shareholder before the vote on the
adoption of the merger agreement, the shareholder must not vote in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, and the
shareholder must otherwise comply with Section 1701.85. A Convergys shareholder’s failure to vote against the adoption of the
merger agreement will not constitute a waiver of such shareholder’s dissenters’ rights, as long as such shareholder does not vote in
favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. Any written demand must specify the shareholder’s name and address, the number
and class of shares held by him, her or it on the record date, and the amount claimed as the “fair cash value” of such Convergys
common shares. See the text of Section 1701.85 of the OGCL attached as Annex E to this joint proxy statement/prospectus for
specific information on the procedures to be followed in exercising dissenters’ rights.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

If Convergys so requests, dissenting shareholders must submit their share certificates to Convergys within 15 days of such
request, for endorsement on such certificates by Convergys that a demand for appraisal has been made. Failure to comply with such
request will terminate the dissenting shareholders’ rights, at Convergys’ option exercised by written notice sent to the applicable
dissenting shareholder within 20 days after the lapse of the 15-day period, unless a court for good cause shown otherwise directs.
Such certificates will be promptly returned to the dissenting shareholders by Convergys. If Convergys and any dissenting
shareholder cannot agree upon the “fair cash value” of Convergys common shares, either may, within three months after service of
demand by the shareholder, file a petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Summit County, Ohio, for a determination of the “fair
cash value” of such dissenting shareholder’s common shares. The fair cash value of a Convergys common share to which a
dissenting shareholder is entitled under Section 1701.85 will be determined as of the day prior to the vote of the Convergys common
shareholders on the adoption of the merger agreement. If the Convergys common shares are listed on a national securities exchange,
such as the NYSE, immediately before the effective time of the initial merger, the fair cash value will be the closing sale price of
Convergys’ common shares as of the close of trading on the day before the vote of the Convergys common shareholders on the
adoption of the merger agreement. Investment banker opinions to company boards of directors regarding the fairness from a
financial point of view of the consideration payable in a transaction, such as the mergers, are not opinions regarding, and do not
address, “fair cash value” under Section 1701.85.

If a Convergys shareholder exercises his or her dissenters’ rights under Section 1701.85, all other rights with respect to such
shareholder’s Convergys common shares will be suspended until Convergys purchases the shares, or the right to receive the fair
cash value is otherwise terminated. All rights of the dissenter with respect to the dissenter’s Convergys common shares will be
reinstated should the right to receive the fair cash value be terminated other than by the purchase of such shares.

The foregoing description of the procedures to be followed in exercising dissenters’ rights available to holders of Convergys
common shares pursuant to Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL may not be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of Sections 1701.84 and 1701.85 of the OGCL attached as Annex E to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

No Appraisal or Dissenters’ Rights for SYNNEX Stockholders

Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the DGCL,
holders of SYNNEX common stock will not be entitled to appraisal or dissenters’ rights in connection with the mergers.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences

General

The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers to U.S. holders of
Convergys common shares of the receipt of shares of SYNNEX common stock and cash pursuant to the initial merger. This
discussion is based on and subject to the Code, applicable Treasury regulations, administrative guidance and interpretations, and
judicial decisions, all as in effect as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, all of which are subject to change, possibly
with retroactive effect, and to differing interpretations. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of
Convergys common shares that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

• a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any
state therein, subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia;

• an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

• a trust (i) that is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and all the substantial decisions of
which are controlled by one or more U.S. persons or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury
regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

This discussion addresses only U.S. holders that hold their Convergys common shares as “capital assets” within the meaning of
Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not constitute tax advice and does not
address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a U.S. holder in light of the U.S. holder’s particular
circumstances, or to a U.S. holder subject to special rules, such as:

• a bank, thrift, mutual fund, or other financial institution or insurance company;

• a real estate investment trust or regulated investment company;

• a tax-exempt organization or governmental organization;

• a trader in securities who elects to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting;

• a dealer or broker in securities;

• an individual retirement or other deferred account;

• a holder whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

• a U.S. expatriate or former citizen or resident of the United States;

• a person that owns (or held at any time during the five year period ending on the date of the disposition of such holder’s
Convergys common shares pursuant to the mergers), actually or constructively, 5% or more of the Convergys common
shares;

• a holder that exercises appraisal rights;

• a subchapter S corporation or other pass-through entity;

• a holder that holds Convergys common shares as part of a hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle, constructive
sale, or conversion, integrated or other risk reduction transaction; or

• a holder that acquired Convergys common shares through the exercise of compensatory options or stock purchase plans or
otherwise as compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan.

If a partnership (including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds
Convergys common shares, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and
the activities of the partnership. A U.S. holder that is a partnership and the partners of such partnership should consult their tax
advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers.

No rulings will be sought from the IRS with respect to the mergers, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert
(or that a court will not sustain) a position that is contrary to the tax consequences described below. This discussion of material U.S.
federal income tax consequences is not a complete description of all potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers.
This discussion does not address tax consequences that may vary with, or are contingent on, individual circumstances. In addition, it
does not address any alternative minimum tax, any non-income tax or any non-U.S., state or local tax consequences of the mergers
or the potential application of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
of 2010 (including the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and intergovernmental agreements entered into pursuant
thereto or in connection therewith).

This discussion is not tax advice. Each Convergys shareholder should consult its tax advisor with respect to the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of the mergers to such holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, as well as
any tax consequences of the mergers arising under the U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to income tax,
including estate or gift tax laws, or under any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. Convergys shareholders that are not U.S.
holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possibility that, in the event the applicable withholding agent is
unable to determine whether any cash consideration paid in the mergers should be treated as a dividend for applicable U.S.
federal income tax purposes, such withholding agent may withhold U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or such
lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on the entire amount

of cash consideration payable to such non-U.S. holder in the merger, and such non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax
advisors as to the possible desirability and timing of selling any shares of SYNNEX common stock or Convergys common
shares that they own.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Mergers

Although SYNNEX, Convergys and their respective affiliates have agreed to use reasonable best efforts to cause the initial
merger, together with the subsequent merger, to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code,
whether or not the transaction will qualify for the intended tax treatment depends on facts that will not be known until the
transaction is completed. In particular, the intended tax treatment requires that the value of the shares of SYNNEX common stock
issued to Convergys shareholders in the initial merger, determined as of the completion of the initial merger, represents at least a
minimum percentage of the total consideration paid to Convergys shareholders in the initial merger. While there is no specific
guidance as to precisely what minimum percentage is necessary to satisfy this requirement, it would be satisfied if the SYNNEX
common stock (valued as of the completion of the initial merger) represents at least 40% of the total merger consideration. Because
this test is based on the value of SYNNEX common stock as of the completion of the initial merger, a decline in the value of
SYNNEX common stock could cause this requirement not to be met. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the mergers will
qualify for the intended tax treatment, even if SYNNEX, Convergys and their respective affiliates comply with the relevant
covenant. In addition, the completion of the mergers is not conditioned on the mergers qualifying for the intended tax treatment or
upon the receipt of an opinion of counsel to that effect, and neither SYNNEX nor Convergys will request a ruling from the IRS
regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the mergers will
qualify for the intended tax treatment. Further, even if SYNNEX and Convergys conclude that the mergers qualify for the intended
tax treatment, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge that conclusion or that a court would not sustain such a
challenge.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences if the Mergers, Taken Together, Qualify as a Reorganization

If the mergers, taken together, qualify as a “reorganization,” then the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers to
U.S. holders of Convergys common shares generally will be as follows.

A U.S. holder will not recognize any loss upon the exchange of Convergys common shares for shares of SYNNEX common
stock and cash in the initial merger, and will recognize gain (if any) in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the amount by which the
sum of the fair market value of the shares of SYNNEX common stock and cash received by the U.S. holder exceeds such U.S.
holder’s tax basis in such U.S. holder’s Convergys common shares, and (ii) the amount of cash received by such U.S. holder (in
each case excluding any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of SYNNEX common stock, which shall be treated as discussed
below).

Any gain recognized by a U.S. holder of Convergys common shares in connection with the initial merger generally will
constitute capital gain, and generally will constitute long-term capital gain if such U.S. holder has held its Convergys common
shares more than one year as of the date of the initial merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including
individuals, are generally taxed at preferential rates. In some cases, including if a holder actually or constructively owns shares of
SYNNEX common stock other than the shares of SYNNEX common stock received pursuant to the initial merger, the recognized
gain could be treated as having the effect of a distribution of a dividend under the tests set forth in Section 302 of the Code, in which
case such gain would be treated as dividend income. Because the possibility of dividend treatment depends on each holder’s
particular circumstances, including the application of constructive ownership rules, Convergys shareholders should consult their tax
advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules to their particular circumstances.

A U.S. holder generally will have an aggregate adjusted tax basis in the SYNNEX common stock received in the initial merger
(including any fractional share interests in SYNNEX common stock deemed received and exchanged for cash, as discussed below)
equal to the aggregate adjusted tax basis of the Convergys common shares surrendered in the initial merger, increased by the amount
of gain, if any, recognized on the exchange (regardless of whether such gain is classified as capital gain or dividend income, as
discussed above, but excluding any gain recognized with respect to any fractional shares of SYNNEX common stock for which cash
is received, as discussed below), and decreased by the amount of cash received in the initial merger (excluding any cash received in
lieu of a fractional share of SYNNEX common stock). A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in

TABLE OF CONTENTS

the SYNNEX common stock received in the initial merger (including a fractional share deemed received) will be allocated between
the SYNNEX common stock actually received and any fractional share deemed received in accordance with their respective fair
market values.

The holding period of the SYNNEX common stock received in exchange for Convergys common shares (including any
fractional shares of SYNNEX common stock deemed received and exchanged for cash, as discussed below) in the initial merger
will include the holding period of the Convergys common shares surrendered in the initial merger.

In the case of a U.S. holder that holds different blocks of Convergys common shares (generally, Convergys common shares
acquired on different dates or at different prices), such U.S. holder should consult its tax advisor regarding the determination of the
basis and holding period of shares of SYNNEX common stock received in the initial merger in respect of particular blocks of
Convergys common shares.

A U.S. holder of Convergys common shares who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of SYNNEX common stock will
generally be treated as having received the fractional share pursuant to the initial merger and then as having sold that fractional
share of SYNNEX common stock for cash. As a result, such U.S. holder will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference
between the amount of cash received in lieu of the fractional share of SYNNEX common stock and the tax basis allocated to such
fractional share of SYNNEX common stock. Gain or loss recognized with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional share of
SYNNEX common stock will generally constitute capital gain or loss and will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if, as of the
date of the initial merger, the holding period for such shares is greater than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.

Tax Consequences if the Mergers, Taken Together, Do Not Qualify as a Reorganization

If the mergers, taken together, do not qualify as a “reorganization,” then a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss
upon the exchange of Convergys common shares in the initial merger equal to the difference, if any, between (1) the sum of the fair
market value of the shares of SYNNEX common stock and the amount of cash received by such holder (including cash received in
lieu of fractional shares of SYNNEX common stock) and (2) the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Convergys common shares
surrendered. If a U.S. holder of Convergys common shares acquired different blocks of Convergys common shares at different times
or at different prices, any gain or loss will be determined separately with respect to each block of Convergys common shares. Any
gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder of Convergys common shares in connection with the initial merger generally will constitute
capital gain or loss, and generally will constitute long-term capital gain or loss if such U.S. holder has held its Convergys common
shares for more than one year as of the date of the initial merger. Long-term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including
individuals, are generally taxed at preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

A U.S. holder generally will have an aggregate tax basis in its shares of SYNNEX common stock received in the initial merger
equal to the fair market value of such shares as of the date such shares are received. A U.S. holder’s holding period in shares of
SYNNEX common stock received in the initial merger will begin on the day following the initial merger.

Notwithstanding the above, in certain circumstances, the receipt of the cash consideration by U.S. holders of Convergys
common shares that also actually or constructively own SYNNEX common stock may be subject to Section 304 of the Code if
holders who own (including by attribution) 50% or more of the Convergys common shares before the initial merger own (including
by attribution), immediately after the initial merger, 50% or more of the SYNNEX common stock. If Section 304 of the Code
applies to the cash consideration received in the initial merger, to the extent a U.S. holder would otherwise be treated for U.S.
federal income tax purposes as selling Convergys common shares to SYNNEX for cash, such holder will instead be treated as
receiving the cash consideration from SYNNEX in deemed redemption of shares of SYNNEX common stock deemed issued to such
holder. If such deemed redemption is treated as having the effect of a distribution of a dividend under the tests set forth in Section
302 of the Code, then a U.S. holder generally would recognize dividend income up to the amount of the cash received. It is not
certain whether Section 304 of the Code will apply to the initial merger, because it is not certain whether shareholders who own
(including by attribution) 50% or more of the Convergys common shares before the initial merger will own (including by
attribution) 50% or more of the SYNNEX common stock immediately after the initial merger. Because the possibility of dividend
treatment depends upon each holder’s particular circumstances, including the application of constructive ownership rules,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Convergys shareholders that also actually or constructively own SYNNEX common stock should consult their tax advisors
regarding the application of the foregoing rules to their particular circumstances.

Backup Withholding and Information Reporting

Regardless of whether the mergers, taken together, qualify as a “reorganization,” any cash payments to a U.S. holder of
Convergys common shares in connection with the initial merger (including cash in lieu of fractional shares of SYNNEX common
stock) generally will be subject to information reporting and may be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding (currently, at a rate
of 24%). To prevent backup withholding, U.S. holders of Convergys common shares should provide the exchange agent with a
properly completed IRS Form W-9 included in the letter of transmittal to be delivered to such U.S. holder.

Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or credit against a U.S. holder’s U.S.
federal income tax liability, provided that such U.S. holder furnishes certain required information to the IRS in a timely fashion. The
IRS may impose a penalty upon any taxpayer that fails to provide the correct taxpayer identification number.

Accounting Treatment

The mergers will be accounted for as an acquisition of a business. SYNNEX will record assets acquired and liabilities assumed
from Convergys primarily at their respective fair values at the date of completion of the mergers. Any excess of the purchase price
(as described under Note 4 under “SYNNEX Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements”) over the net fair
value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill.

The financial condition and results of operations of SYNNEX after completion of the mergers will reflect Convergys’ balances
and results after completion of the transaction but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial condition or
results of operations of Convergys. The earnings of SYNNEX following the completion of the mergers will reflect acquisition
accounting adjustments, including the effect of changes in the carrying value for assets and liabilities on interest expense and
amortization expense. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, if any, and goodwill will not be amortized but will be tested for
impairment at least annually, and all assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If,
in the future, SYNNEX determines that tangible or intangible assets (including goodwill) are impaired, SYNNEX would record an
impairment charge at that time.

Listing of SYNNEX common stock and Delisting and Deregistration of Convergys Common Shares

Application will be made to have the shares of SYNNEX common stock to be issued in connection with the initial merger
approved for listing on the NYSE, where shares of SYNNEX common stock are currently traded. If the mergers are completed,
Convergys common shares will no longer be listed on the NYSE and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

Description of Debt Financing

SYNNEX anticipates that the total amount of funds necessary to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration and to pay
transaction fees and expenses will be approximately $1,540 million, which amount is subject to adjustment as further described in
“The Merger Agreement—Merger Consideration.” In addition, SYNNEX anticipates that the total amount of funds necessary to
directly or indirectly pay, repay, repurchase, or settle, as applicable, certain existing indebtedness of Convergys and its subsidiaries
will be approximately $500 million. These amounts will be funded through the takeout facility and cash on hand that SYNNEX may
elect to apply in lieu of borrowing under the takeout facility. Remaining amounts under the takeout facility will be used for general
corporate purposes, including, without limitation, permitted acquisitions or dividends.

Pursuant to the bridge commitment letter for the bridge facility, SYNNEX received commitments for an aggregate principal
amount of $3.57 billion in financing, to provide a senior secured 364-day term loan bridge facility. The bridge facility consisted of
two different tranches of senior secured term loans: tranche A of the bridge facility for $1.8 billion in the aggregate and tranche B of
the bridge facility for $1.77 billion in the aggregate. The purpose of tranche B of the bridge facility was to backstop an amendment
to the existing credit facility in order to permit the incurrence of acquisition related indebtedness under either the bridge facility or
the

takeout facility. However, on August 7, 2018, SYNNEX obtained an amendment to the existing credit agreement and, as a result,
tranche B of the bridge facility was automatically reduced to zero. On August 9, 2018, SYNNEX entered into the takeout facility
and, as a result, pursuant to the terms of the bridge commitment letter, the commitment with respect to tranche A of the bridge
facility was automatically reduced to zero. As a result of the termination of both tranche A of the bridge facility and tranche B of the
bridge facility, there are no remaining financing commitments of the lenders thereunder, and instead, the debt financing will be
provided under the takeout facility.

Pursuant to the takeout facility, SYNNEX received commitments for a $1.8 billion 5-year senior secured term loan A facility
from a syndicate of commercial banks. The term loan commitments under the takeout facility are subject to customary conditions.
The borrower under the takeout facility is SYNNEX and the secured obligations of SYNNEX under the takeout facility are and will
be guaranteed and secured by each existing and subsequently acquired or formed direct and indirect domestic wholly-owned
subsidiary of SYNNEX, subject to customary exceptions.

The term loan commitments under the takeout facility terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the end date in the event the
initial funding under the takeout facility has not occurred on or prior to such date, (ii) the date on which SYNNEX provides notice
under the takeout facility in the event that the merger agreement has been terminated and (iii) in the event SYNNEX voluntarily
elects to reduce such commitments to zero, on such date.

Senior Secured Credit Facilities

The proceeds of the term loans under the takeout facility, together with cash on hand which SYNNEX may elect to apply in
lieu of borrowing under the takeout facility, will be used to pay the cash equivalent merger consideration, to pay transaction fees and
expenses and to pay, repay, repurchase, or settle, as applicable, certain existing indebtedness of Convergys and its subsidiaries.
Remaining amounts under the takeout facility will be used for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, permitted
acquisitions or dividends.

Interest Rate

The interest rate per annum applicable to the term loans under the takeout facility are, at SYNNEX’ option, equal to either a
base rate or a LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin, which may (in the case of LIBOR based loans) range from 1.25% to 1.75%,
depending on SYNNEX’ consolidated leverage ratio. The applicable margin on base rate loans is 1.00% less than the corresponding
margin on LIBOR based loans.

Amortization and Prepayments

Once advanced, the outstanding principal amount of the takeout facility will be payable in equal quarterly amounts equal to 5%
per annum of the principal of the term loan A facility outstanding as of the 90th day after the initial funding date, with the remaining
balance due at the maturity of the term loan A facility. The takeout facility is not subject to mandatory prepayment. SYNNEX may
prepay all or any portion of the term loans under the takeout facility prior to maturity without premium or penalty, subject to
reimbursement of any LIBOR breakage costs of the lenders.

Delayed Draw

An aggregate of up to $350.0 million of the takeout facility is available to be drawn down, with draws permitted up to five
additional times for the 90 day period following initial funding date (which date will be concurrent with the closing of the mergers)
to fund the obligation to repurchase or settle any of the convertible debentures upon the tender for repurchase or conversion thereof
to the holders thereof in connection with the initial merger.

Conditions to Initial Funding

The obligation of the lenders to fund the initial term loans under the takeout facility is subject, among other things, to:

• consummation of the mergers substantially concurrently with the initial funding of the takeout facility in all material
respects in accordance with the merger agreement, without any amendment or

modification thereto which is materially adverse to the interests of the lenders under the takeout facilities, who are
collectively referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the takeout lenders, unless approved by the arrangers of
the takeout facility (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);

• the accuracy of certain limited representations and warranties;

• execution and delivery by certain additional subsidiaries of SYNNEX and certain subsidiaries of Convergys acquired by
SYNNEX as a result of the mergers of customary joinder documentation with respect to the takeout facility and the grant
of security interests over their assets, subject to certain customary limited conditionality exceptions;

• delivery of historical consolidated financial statements regarding SYNNEX and Convergys;

• delivery of pro forma financial statements regarding SYNNEX and its subsidiaries, after giving effect to the transactions;

• the repayment of certain indebtedness of Convergys and its subsidiaries substantially concurrent with the initial funding of
the takeout facility;

• solvency of SYNNEX and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, after giving effect to the consummation of the
transactions; and

• since January 1, 2018, no material adverse effect on Convergys.

For more information, see “The Merger Agreement—Financing.”

Certain Covenants and Events of Default

The takeout facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default (including relating to a
change of control) that are substantially similar to the existing credit agreement. Among other things, such negative covenants
restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of SYNNEX and its subsidiaries, to grant liens on their assets, incur indebtedness,
sell assets, make investments, engage in certain acquisitions, mergers or consolidations and pay dividends and other restricted
payments. In addition, the takeout facility contains the following maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio
that are identical to the corresponding ratios set forth in the existing credit agreement: SYNNEX’ maximum consolidated leverage
ratio may not exceed 4.25 to 1.00, with a step-down to 4.00 to 1.00 after the fifth full fiscal quarter following the closing of the
mergers and SYNNEX’ minimum interest coverage ratio may not be less than 3.50 to 1.00.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT

The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the merger agreement. This summary may not contain all
the information about the merger agreement that is important to you. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
merger agreement attached as Annex A to, and incorporated by reference into, this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You are
encouraged to read the merger agreement in its entirety because it is the legal document that governs the mergers.

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement and the Summary of the Merger Agreement: Representations,
Warranties and Covenants in the Merger Agreement Are Not Intended to Function or Be Relied on as Public Disclosures

The merger agreement and the summary of its terms in this joint proxy statement/prospectus have been included to provide
information about the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. The terms, conditions and information in the merger agreement
are not intended to provide any public disclosure of factual information about SYNNEX, Convergys or any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the merger agreement were made
by SYNNEX, Convergys and the Merger Subs as of specific dates and were qualified and subject to certain limitations and
exceptions agreed to by SYNNEX, Convergys and the Merger Subs in connection with negotiating the terms of the merger
agreement. In particular, in your review of the representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement and described in
this summary, it is important to bear in mind that the representations and warranties were negotiated for the purpose of allocating
contractual risk among the parties to the merger agreement rather than to establish matters as facts. The representations and
warranties may also be subject to a contractual standard of materiality or material adverse effect that is different from what may be
viewed as material by stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, or other investors and from the materiality standard applicable to
reports and documents filed with the SEC and in some cases may be qualified by disclosures made by one party to the other, which
are not reflected in the merger agreement. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and
warranties, which do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, may have changed since the
date of the merger agreement.

For the foregoing reasons, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements and any descriptions of those provisions
should not be read alone as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of SYNNEX, Convergys or any of their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Instead, such provisions or descriptions should be read only in conjunction with the other
information provided elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus or incorporated by reference into this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Structure of the Mergers

The merger agreement provides for the initial merger, in which Merger Sub I will be merged with and into Convergys, with
Convergys surviving the initial merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX, and immediately following the initial merger, the
subsequent merger, in which Convergys will be merged with and into Merger Sub II, with Merger Sub II surviving the subsequent
merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of SYNNEX.

After the completion of the initial merger and before the completion of the subsequent merger, Convergys’ articles and
Convergys’ code, each in effect immediately prior to the completion of the initial merger, will be the articles of incorporation and
code of regulations, respectively, of Convergys, as the surviving corporation in the initial merger, in each case until amended in
accordance with applicable law. After the completion of the initial merger and before completion of the subsequent merger, the
directors and officers of Merger Sub I immediately prior to the completion of the initial merger, will be the directors and officers,
respectively, of Convergys, as the surviving corporation in the initial merger, in each case until their successors are duly elected and
qualified.

After the completion of the subsequent merger, the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of Merger Sub II, each in effect
immediately prior to the completion of the subsequent merger, will be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, respectively, of
the surviving company in the subsequent merger, in each case until amended in accordance with applicable law. After completion of
the subsequent merger, the officers of Merger Sub II immediately prior to the completion of the subsequent merger, will be the
directors and officers of the surviving company, until their successors are duly and qualified in accordance with the surviving
company’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws and applicable law.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Completion and Effectiveness of the Mergers

Each of the mergers will be completed and become effective at such time as the certificates of merger for such merger is filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio and Secretary of State of Delaware (or at such time as agreed to between Convergys
and SYNNEX and specified in such certificates of merger in accordance with applicable law). Unless another date and time are
agreed to by SYNNEX and Convergys, completion of the mergers will occur on the third business day following the day on which
the last of the conditions described under “—Conditions to Completion of the Mergers” is to be satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing of the mergers, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions).

As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, SYNNEX and Convergys expect that the mergers will be completed by
the end of calendar year 2018. However, completion of the mergers is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to
completion of the mergers, which are summarized below. There can be no assurances as to when, or if, the mergers will occur. If the
mergers are not completed on or before the initial end date of December 28, 2018, either SYNNEX or Convergys may terminate the
merger agreement, unless all conditions to completion of the mergers have been satisfied on the initial end date other than an order
or injunction arising under antitrust law or all waiting periods under the HSR Act (early termination was granted, effective on July
30, 2018) having been expired or terminated, and all antitrust filing, notices, approvals and clearances having been obtained or filed
in certain other jurisdictions, such conditions have not been waived by SYNNEX and Convergys, and either SYNNEX or
Convergys elects to extend the initial end date to March 28, 2019, in which case, if the mergers are not completed on or before
March 28, 2019, either SYNNEX or Convergys may terminate the merger agreement. The right to terminate the merger agreement if
the mergers are not completed on or prior to the end date will not be available to SYNNEX or Convergys if the failure of the
mergers to be consummated by such date is due to a material breach by such party of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement of such party set forth in the merger agreement. See “—Conditions to Completion of the Mergers” and “—Termination of
the Merger Agreement.”

Merger Consideration

At the completion of the initial merger, each Convergys common share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the initial merger, except for shares held by Convergys as treasury stock, shares owned by SYNNEX or Merger
Sub I immediately prior to the completion of the initial merger, shares held by any subsidiary of Convergys or SYNNEX and shares
with respect to which appraisal rights have been properly exercised in accordance with the OGCL, which are referred to in this joint
proxy statement/prospectus as the dissenting shares, will be automatically converted into (i) a number of validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable shares of SYNNEX common stock equal to the exchange ratio (as defined below), which translates to 0.1193
shares of SYNNEX common stock, subject to certain adjustments to be made at the closing of the mergers if the 20 day average
trading price of SYNNEX common stock three trading days prior to the closing of the mergers has increased or decreased by more
than 10% from a base price of $111.0766, plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of SYNNEX common stock (with cash payable
in lieu of any fractional shares as described under “—Fractional Shares”) and (ii) the right to receive $13.25 in cash, without
interest.

“Exchange ratio” means (i) if the SYNNEX closing price is less than 85% of $111.0766, 0.1193 multiplied by 1.05882, (ii) if
the SYNNEX closing price is greater than or equal to 85% of $111.0766 and less than 90% of $111.0766, 0.1193 multiplied by the
quotient of (A) 90% of $111.0766 divided by (B) the SYNNEX closing price, (iii) if the SYNNEX closing price is greater than or
equal to 90% of $111.0766 and less than or equal to 110% of $111.0766, 0.1193, (iv) if the SYNNEX closing price is greater than
110% of $111.0766 and less than or equal to 115% of $111.0766, 0.1193 multiplied by the quotient of (A) 110% of $111.0766
divided by (B) the SYNNEX closing price and (v) if the SYNNEX closing price is greater than 115% of $111.0766, 0.1193
multiplied by 0.95652.

If, between the dates of the merger agreement and the completion of the initial merger, any change in the outstanding
Convergys common shares occurs as a result of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event, the merger consideration will be equitably
adjusted to proportionally reflect such change.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Fractional Shares

No fractional shares of SYNNEX common stock will be issued to any holder of Convergys common shares upon the
completion of the initial merger. Instead, all fractional shares of SYNNEX common stock that a holder of Convergys common
shares would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the initial merger will be aggregated and sold by the exchange agent, and
the holder will be entitled to receive cash in an amount representing such holder’s proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the
sale by the exchange agent on behalf of such holder of SYNNEX common stock that would otherwise be issued. No interest will be
paid or accrued on cash payable in lieu of fractional SYNNEX common stock and no such holder will be entitled to dividends,
voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of SYNNEX common stock that would otherwise have been
issuable as part of the merger consideration.

Shares Subject to Properly Exercised Appraisal Rights

Convergys common shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the initial merger and held by a
holder who is entitled to demand, and has properly demanded, appraisal for such Convergys common shares in accordance with the
OGCL will not be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration to which they would otherwise be entitled to under
the merger agreement, but will instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to
such holder pursuant to the procedures set forth in the OGCL. If any such holder withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to
perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal pursuant to the OGCL, then such holder’s Convergys common shares will instead be
deemed to have been converted into the right to receive the merger consideration.

Procedures for Surrendering Convergys Certificates

The conversion of Convergys common shares into the right to receive the merger consideration will occur automatically at the
effective time of the initial merger. Prior to the closing of the mergers, SYNNEX will appoint an exchange agent reasonably
acceptable to Convergys and enter into an exchange agent agreement reasonably acceptable to Convergys providing for the
exchange agent to handle the exchange of certificates or book-entry form representing Convergys common shares for the merger
consideration. At the effective time of the initial merger, SYNNEX will deposit, or cause to be deposited, cash sufficient to pay the
cash equivalent merger consideration and evidence of shares of SYNNEX common stock in book-entry form payable to Convergys
shareholders (and/or certificates representing such SYNNEX common stock at SYNNEX’ election) as part of the merger
consideration, with the exchange agent in trust for the benefit of Convergys shareholders. Any such cash, shares represented by
certificates and book-entry form deposited with the exchange agent is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the
payment fund. Promptly (but not later than three business days) after the completion of the initial merger, SYNNEX will cause the
exchange agent to mail to each holder of record of Convergys common shares whose shares were converted pursuant to the merger
agreement a letter of transmittal and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Convergys common shares represented by
certificates or book-entry form in exchange for the merger consideration.

Convergys shareholders who surrender their certificates or book-entry form representing Convergys common shares together
with a duly completed and executed letter of transmittal will be entitled to receive the merger consideration into which the
Convergys common shares represented by such certificates or book-entry form have been converted pursuant to the merger
agreement. After the completion of the initial merger, subject to applicable law in the case of dissenting shares, all Convergys
shareholders will cease to have any rights as shareholders of Convergys other than the right to receive the merger consideration into
which Convergys common shares represented by certificates or book-entry form have been converted upon surrender of such
certificates or book-entry form (and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of SYNNEX common stock as described under “—
Fractional Shares,” and any dividends or other distributions on the shares of SYNNEX common stock into which such Convergys
common shares have been converted into as described below under “—Procedures for Surrendering Convergys Certificates”),
without interest, and the stock transfer books of Convergys will be closed with respect to all Convergys common shares outstanding
immediately prior to the completion of the initial merger, and there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the surviving corporation in the initial merger of Convergys common shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
completion of the initial merger. Any portion of the payment fund, including any interest or other amounts received with respect
thereto, that remains unclaimed or undistributed for twelve months after the completion of the initial merger will be delivered to
SYNNEX, and any holder thereafter will look only to SYNNEX or the surviving company for the satisfaction of its claim for
merger consideration, without any interest.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

After the completion of the initial merger, SYNNEX will not pay dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after
the completion of the initial merger to any holder of Convergys common shares to be converted into SYNNEX common stock until
the holder surrenders its certificate or book-entry form representing Convergys common shares as described above. However, once
those certificates or uncertificated Convergys common shares are surrendered, SYNNEX will pay to the holder, without interest, any
dividends or other distributions on the shares of SYNNEX common stock into which such Convergys common shares have been
converted with a record date on or after the completion of the initial merger that had become payable.

If there is a transfer of ownership of Convergys common shares that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of
Convergys, payment of the merger consideration as described above (and cash in lieu of any fractional SYNNEX common stock as
described under “—Fractional Shares,” and any dividends or other distributions on the shares of SYNNEX common stock into
which such Convergys common shares have been converted into as described above under “—Procedures for Surrendering
Convergys Certificates”), without interest, may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the certificate or
uncertificated share so surrendered is registered only if the transferee presents such certificate or book-entry form together with all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and evidence that all applicable stock transfer or other similar taxes have
been paid or are not applicable.

Convergys, SYNNEX, the Merger Subs and the exchange agent are entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise
payable pursuant to the merger agreement, any amounts required to be deducted or withheld with respect to making such payment
under applicable tax law, without duplication. To the extent any amounts are so deducted, withheld and timely remitted to the
appropriate taxing authority, such deducted or withheld amounts will be treated as having been paid to the person in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

If any certificate representing Convergys common shares has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the person claiming such certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed will make an affidavit of that fact and, if required by SYNNEX or the exchange agent, post a bond in
such amount as SYNNEX or the exchange agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it or the surviving company with respect to such certificate. Thereafter, the exchange agent (or, if subsequent to the
termination of the payment fund, SYNNEX) will deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the merger
consideration (together with cash in an amount representing any fractional share of SYNNEX common stock and any dividends or

Convergys Options

At the completion of the initial merger, each Convergys option outstanding immediately prior to the completion of the initial
merger that has an exercise price per Convergys common share that is less than the cash equivalent merger consideration will be
cancelled by virtue of the initial merger and without any action on the part of the holder of such Convergys option, in consideration
for the right to receive, promptly (but not later than five business days) following the completion of the initial merger, a cash
payment (without interest and less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under applicable tax law with respect to
the making of such payment) with respect thereto equal to the product of (A) the number of Convergys common shares subject to
such Convergys option as of immediately prior to the completion of the initial merger, multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of the
cash equivalent merger consideration over the exercise price per Convergys common share subject to such Convergys option as of
immediately prior to the completion of the initial merger.

At the completion of the initial merger, each vested or unvested Convergys option outstanding immediately prior to the
completion of the initial merger that has an exercise price per Convergys common share greater than or equal to the cash equivalent
merger consideration will be cancelled for no consideration.

The cash equivalent merger consideration is the sum of (A) $13.25 plus (B) the product of the number of shares of SYNNEX
common stock equal to the exchange ratio, multiplied by the SYNNEX closing price.

virtue of the initial merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, in consideration for the right to receive a cash
payment (without interest and less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under applicable tax law with respect to
the making of such payment), which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the cash award amount, with respect
thereto equal to the product of (i) the number of Convergys common shares subject to such Convergys RSU, Convergys PSU, or
Convergys DSU as of immediately prior to the completion of the initial merger (with respect to each Convergys PSU, such number
of shares will equal the greater of the number of shares that would be earned based upon target performance and the number of
shares determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement, with any associated performance determinations to be made
by Convergys’ board of directors) and (ii) the cash equivalent merger consideration (or, if higher, a cash amount equal to the average
of the opening and closing prices per Convergys common share on the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the closing
date of the mergers).

The cash award amount payable in respect of a Convergys RSU or Convergys PSU that was granted on or after March 31, 2016
(other than any such Convergys RSU or Convergys PSU that is held by a non-employee director or that becomes vested at the
completion of the initial merger pursuant to the terms of an applicable contract) will remain unvested as of the completion of the
initial merger and continue to vest and be paid in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement (including the terms
relating to accelerated vesting upon a qualifying termination of employment).

To the extent that any such Convergys RSU, Convergys PSU or Convergys DSU constitutes nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, the cash award amount related thereto will be paid at the earliest time permitted
under the terms of such award that will not result in the application of a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

Other than as provided above, the cash award amount will paid promptly following the completion of the initial merger, but not
later than five business days following such date.

Definition of “Material Adverse Effect”

Many of the representations and warranties in the merger agreement are qualified by “material adverse effect” on the party
making such representations and warranties.

For purposes of the merger agreement, “material adverse effect” means, with respect to SYNNEX or Convergys, as the case
may be, any change, effect, event, occurrence or development that has a material adverse effect on the business, operations or
financial condition of that party and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, except that the impact of the following changes, effects,
events, occurrences or developments will be excluded in determining whether there has been a material adverse effect, or whether a
material adverse effect would reasonably be expected to occur:

• any changes or developments in domestic, foreign or global markets or domestic, foreign or global economic conditions
generally, including (1) any changes or developments in or affecting the domestic or any foreign securities, equity, credit
or financial markets or (2) any changes or developments in or affecting domestic or any foreign interest or exchange rates;

• changes in GAAP or any official interpretation or enforcement thereof;

• changes in law or any changes or developments in the official interpretation or enforcement thereof by governmental
authorities;

• changes in domestic, foreign or global political conditions (including the outbreak or escalation of war, military actions, or
acts of terrorism), including any worsening of such conditions threatened or existing on the date of the merger agreement;

• weather conditions or other acts of God (including storms, earthquakes, tornados, floods or other natural disasters);

• a decline in the trading price or trading volume of that party’s common stock or any change in the ratings or ratings
outlook for that party or any of its subsidiaries;

• the failure to meet any projections, guidance, budgets, forecasts or estimates, except that the underlying causes thereof
may be considered in determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred if not otherwise excluded from the
definition of material adverse effect);

• any action taken or omitted to be taken by that party or any of its subsidiaries at the written request of the other party;

• any actions or claims made or brought by any of the current or former shareholders of that party (or on their behalf or on
behalf of that party) against that party or any of its directors, officers or employees arising out of the merger agreement or
the mergers;

• the announcement or the existence of the merger agreement if arising from the identity of the other party or its affiliates;
and

• the failure to obtain any approvals or consents from any governmental authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement;

except, in the case of the changes, effects, events, occurrences or developments referred to in the third and fifth bullets in the
immediately preceding list, to the extent that such impact is disproportionately adverse to that party and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, relative to others in the industry or industries in which that party and its subsidiaries operate.

Additionally, “material adverse effect” means, with respect to SYNNEX or Convergys, as the case may be, any change, effect,
event, occurrence or development that would prevent or materially impair the ability of the other party to consummate the mergers
by the end date.

written consent of Convergys (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (iii) as contemplated or required
by the merger agreement or (iv) as set forth in SYNNEX’ confidential disclosure schedule delivered to Convergys concurrently with
execution of the merger agreement, SYNNEX will not, and will not permit any of its subsidiaries to, among other things:

• acquire or agree to acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a material portion of the assets of or equity
in, any person if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such transaction could
reasonably be expected to (i) prevent, materially delay or materially impede the obtaining of, or adversely affect in any
material respect the ability of SYNNEX to procure, any authorizations, consents, orders, declarations or approvals of any
governmental authority or the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or (ii) materially increase the risk of any governmental authority
entering an order, ruling, judgment or injunction prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement or (iii) take any action that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to adversely affect or
materially delay the ability of SYNNEX to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Obligations to Recommend the Adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Approval of the Stock Issuance

As discussed under “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval of the
Stock Issuance—Convergys’ Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendations of the Convergys Board of Directors that Convergys
Shareholders Adopt the Merger Agreement,” Convergys’ board of directors unanimously recommends that Convergys shareholders
vote “FOR” the adoption of the merger agreement. Convergys’ board of directors, however, may make an adverse recommendation
change under specified circumstances as discussed under “—No Solicitation.”

Similarly, as discussed under “Convergys Proposal I: Adoption of the Merger Agreement and SYNNEX Proposal I: Approval
of the Stock Issuance—SYNNEX’ Reasons for the Mergers; Recommendations of SYNNEX’ Board of Directors that SYNNEX
Stockholders Approve the Stock Issuance,” SYNNEX’ board of directors unanimously recommends that SYNNEX stockholders
vote “FOR” the stock issuance.

Neither Convergys’ board of directors nor any committee thereof will:

• change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in each case in any manner adverse to SYNNEX, or fail to include in this
joint proxy statement/prospectus, a recommendation that Convergys shareholders adopt the merger agreement;

• approve or recommend to Convergys shareholders, or resolve to or publicly propose or announce its intention to approve
or recommend to Convergys shareholders, a takeover proposal;

• fail to recommend against acceptance of any takeover proposal that is structured as a tender offer or exchange offer for
Convergys common shares within ten business days after commencement of such offer;

• fail to reaffirm the recommendation that Convergys shareholders adopt the merger agreement within ten business days
after a request therefor by SYNNEX following the date any written takeover proposal (or any material written
modification thereto) is first publicly disclosed by Convergys or the person making the written takeover proposal
(provided that SYNNEX may not make such a request more than once for each takeover proposal or material modification
thereto);

• agree or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any action described in the first five bullets of this paragraph are
collectively referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as an adverse recommendation change); or

• authorize, cause or permit Convergys or any of its subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement (including an acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint

venture agreement or other agreement), commitment or agreement in principle with respect to any takeover proposal,
other than a confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality provisions that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to
Convergys than those contained in its confidentiality agreement with SYNNEX.

“Takeover proposal” means any bona fide proposal or offer made by any person or group of related persons (other than
SYNNEX and its subsidiaries and affiliates), and whether involving a transaction or series of related transactions, for (i) a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving
Convergys, (ii) the acquisition by any person or group of related persons (other than SYNNEX and its affiliates) of more than 20%
of the assets of Convergys and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis (in each case, including securities of the subsidiaries of
Convergys), or (iii) the direct or indirect acquisition by any person or group of related persons (other than SYNNEX and its
affiliates) of more than 20% of the Convergys common shares then issued and outstanding.

No Solicitation

Subject to the exceptions described below, Convergys will not, and will cause each of its subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers and directors, and will instruct each of its other representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

• solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or facilitate any proposal or offer or any inquiries regarding the making of any
proposal or offer, including any proposal or offer to its shareholders, that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, a takeover proposal;

• engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person
any information in connection with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a takeover proposal (other than, in response to an unsolicited
inquiry, to ascertain facts from the person making such takeover proposal for the sole purpose of clarifying the terms and
conditions thereof so as to determine whether such takeover proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, a superior acquisition proposal (as defined below) and to refer the inquiring person to the non-solicit provisions of the
merger agreement and to limit its conversation or other communication exclusively to such referral and such clarifying of
terms as provided herein); or

• approve, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar
document, agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle with respect to a takeover proposal.

“Superior acquisition proposal” means a takeover proposal, substituting “50%” for “20%” in the definition thereof, that
Convergys’ board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Convergys’ independent financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, taking into account the timing, likelihood of consummation, legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of
the takeover proposal, including the financing terms thereof, and such other factors as Convergys’ board of directors considers to be
appropriate, to be more favorable to Convergys and its shareholders than the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

Convergys will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries and direct its and their representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any persons (other than SYNNEX and the Merger Subs) that may be ongoing
with respect to a takeover proposal and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such person in possession of non-
public information in respect of Convergys or its subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of Convergys and its subsidiaries in
connection with such takeover proposal to return or destroy (and confirm such destruction of) all such information. Convergys will
not release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any standstill or
confidentiality provision with respect to a takeover proposal or similar matter in any agreement to which Convergys is a party;
provided, that if Convergys’ board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law, Convergys may waive any
such standstill provision solely to the extent necessary to permit a third party to make a takeover proposal.

However, if at any time after the date of the merger agreement and prior to obtaining the Convergys shareholder approval,
Convergys receives a bona fide unsolicited written takeover proposal from any person that

did not result from a breach of the restrictions contained in “—Obligations to Recommend the Adoption of the Merger Agreement
and the Approval of the Stock Issuance” and “—No Solicitation,” and if Convergys’ board of directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such takeover proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a superior acquisition proposal, then Convergys and its representatives may (i) furnish, pursuant to
a confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality provisions that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable to Convergys than
those contained in its confidentiality agreement with SYNNEX, information (including non-public information) with respect to
Convergys and its subsidiaries to the person that has made such takeover proposal and its representatives (provided, that Convergys
will, substantially concurrently with the delivery to such person, provide to SYNNEX any non-public information concerning
Convergys or any of its subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its representatives unless such non-public
information has been previously provided to SYNNEX) and (ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations
with the person making such takeover proposal and its representatives regarding such takeover proposal. Convergys will promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) notify SYNNEX in writing if Convergys takes any of the actions in clauses (i) and (ii) above.

Convergys will promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt) notify SYNNEX in writing in the event that
Convergys or any of its representatives receives a takeover proposal or any offer, proposal, inquiry or request for information or
discussions relating to Convergys or its subsidiaries that would be reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates a takeover
proposal, including the identity of the person making such takeover proposal or offer, proposal, inquiry or request and the material
terms and conditions thereof. Convergys will keep SYNNEX reasonably informed, on a reasonably current basis (but in no event
more often than once every 24 hours), as to the status of (including any material developments) such takeover proposal, offer,
proposal, inquiry or request.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, at any time after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the time the
Convergys shareholder approval is obtained, Convergys’ board of directors may make an adverse recommendation change if, prior
to taking such action, Convergys’ board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with Convergys’ board of directors’ fiduciary duties
under applicable law; provided, that prior to making such adverse recommendation change, (I) Convergys has given SYNNEX at
least two business days prior written notice of its intention to take such action specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor,
and (II) upon the end of such notice period, Convergys’ board of directors will have considered in good faith any revisions to the
terms of the merger agreement proposed in writing by SYNNEX, and will have determined, after consultation with independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to make an adverse recommendation change would reasonably be
expected to continue to be inconsistent with Convergys’ board of directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the date of the merger agreement and prior to the time the Convergys
shareholder approval is obtained, if Convergys’ board of directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that a written takeover proposal made after the date of the merger agreement constitutes
a superior acquisition proposal, Convergys’ board of directors may, subject to compliance with this paragraph, (i) make an adverse
recommendation change or (ii) cause Convergys to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into a definitive agreement
relating to such superior acquisition proposal subject to paying a termination fee to SYNNEX in accordance with the provisions
described under “—Termination Fees and Expenses;” provided, that prior to so making an adverse recommendation change or
terminating the merger agreement, (A) Convergys has given SYNNEX at least four business days’ prior written notice of its
intention to take such action, including the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making, any such
superior acquisition proposal and has contemporaneously provided to SYNNEX a copy of the superior acquisition proposal and a
copy of any proposed superior acquisition proposal (which version will be updated, as applicable, promptly), (B) at the end of such
notice period, Convergys’ board of directors will have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of the merger agreement
proposed in writing by SYNNEX, and will have determined, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that the superior acquisition proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a superior acquisition proposal if the
revisions proposed by SYNNEX were to be given effect, and (C) in the event of any change to any of the financial terms (including
the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of such superior acquisition proposal,
Convergys will, in each case,

have delivered to SYNNEX an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) above of this proviso and a new notice
period of two business days will commence during which time Convergys will be required to comply with the requirements of this
paragraph anew with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (C) above of this proviso.

Nothing will prohibit Convergys or Convergys’ board of directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the shareholders of
Convergys a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act (it being understood that such action may constitute an adverse recommendation change for purposes of the preceding
paragraph and SYNNEX’ termination right in the event of an adverse recommendation change if it otherwise satisfies the definition
thereof) or (ii) from making any “stop, look and listen” communication to the shareholders of Convergys pursuant to Rule 14d 9(f)
under the Exchange Act.

Proxy Statement and Registration Statement Covenant

As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of the merger agreement, (i) Convergys and SYNNEX have agreed to
jointly prepare and each file with the SEC this joint proxy statement/prospectus and (ii) SYNNEX has agreed to prepare and file
with the SEC the registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to the shares of SYNNEX common stock issuable in connection
with the initial merger, which will include this joint proxy statement/prospectus with respect to the Convergys special meeting and
the SYNNEX special meeting. Each of Convergys and SYNNEX will use its reasonable best efforts to (A) have the registration
statement on Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, (B) ensure that the
registration statement on Form S-4 complies in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and
Securities Act, and (C) keep the registration statement on Form S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete the mergers.

Each of Convergys and SYNNEX has agreed to furnish all information concerning itself, its respective affiliates and the
holders of its shares to the other and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and the registration statement on Form S-4. Each of
Convergys and SYNNEX has agreed to provide the other party with a reasonable period of time to review this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and any amendments thereto prior to filing and will reasonably consider any comments from the other party.
Each of Convergys and SYNNEX will respond promptly to any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC. Each of Convergys
and SYNNEX will notify the other party promptly of the receipt of any comments (whether written or oral) from the SEC or the
staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to this joint proxy
statement/prospectus or the registration statement on Form S-4 or for additional information and will supply the other party with
copies of all correspondence between it and any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the
other hand, with respect to this joint proxy statement/prospectus or registration statement on Form S-4 or the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement within 48 hours of the receipt thereof. This joint proxy statement/prospectus and registration
statement on Form S-4 will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and
Securities Act.

If at any time prior to the Convergys special meeting or the SYNNEX special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement of
the Convergys special meeting or the SYNNEX special meeting) any information relating to SYNNEX or Convergys, or any of
their respective affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by SYNNEX or Convergys that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to this joint proxy statement/prospectus and registration statement on Form S-4, so that this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and registration statement on Form S-4 would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
the party that discovers such information will promptly notify the other party and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information will be promptly filed by Convergys and/or SYNNEX with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable law, disseminated to Convergys shareholders and SYNNEX stockholders. Convergys will cause this joint proxy
statement/prospectus and registration statement on Form S-4 to be mailed to Convergys shareholders, and SYNNEX will cause this
joint proxy statement/prospectus and registration statement on Form S-4 to be mailed to SYNNEX stockholders, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the registration statement on Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act.

Obligations to Call Shareholders’ and Stockholders’ Meetings

As soon as reasonably practicable following the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4, Convergys will take
all actions necessary in accordance with applicable law and its organizational documents to set a record date for, duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders following the mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for the purpose of
obtaining the Convergys shareholder approval. Unless Convergys makes an adverse recommendation change, as discussed under
“—No Solicitation,” it will solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the Convergys shareholder approval at the
Convergys special meeting as soon as reasonably practicable.

As soon as reasonably practicable following the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4, SYNNEX will take all
action necessary in accordance with applicable law and its organizational documents to set a record date for, duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders following the mailing of this joint proxy statement/prospectus for the purpose of
obtaining the SYNNEX stockholder approval. SYNNEX will solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, the SYNNEX
stockholder approval at the SYNNEX special meeting as soon as reasonably practicable.

Neither Convergys nor SYNNEX may adjourn or postpone the meeting of its shareholders or stockholders, respectively,
without the prior written consent of the other party (which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). However,
each party may, without the prior written consent of the other party, adjourn or postpone the meeting of its shareholders or
stockholders, as applicable, (i) to allow time for the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure document
that its board of directors has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required to be filed and
disseminated under applicable law, (ii) if as of the time that the meeting of its shareholders or stockholders, respectively, is
originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Convergys common shares or SYNNEX common stock, respectively,
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or (iii) if such
party reasonably determines in good faith that the Convergys shareholder approval or SYNNEX stockholder approval, as applicable,
is unlikely to be obtained. Without the prior written consent of the other party (which will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), the approval of the adoption the merger agreement, with respect to Convergys, and the issuance of
SYNNEX common stock in connection with the initial merger, with respect to SYNNEX, will be the only matters (other than
matters of procedure and matters required by applicable law to be voted on by such party’s shareholders or stockholders, as
applicable, in connection with the adoption of the merger agreement) that such party will propose to be acted on by its shareholders
or stockholders, as applicable, at the Convergys special meeting and the SYNNEX special meeting, respectively.

Employee Matters

Effective as of the completion of the initial merger and during the one-year period immediately following the completion of the
initial merger, SYNNEX will provide, or will cause the surviving company to provide, to each employee of Convergys or its
subsidiaries who was an employee immediately prior to the completion of the initial merger and who continues to be employed by
SYNNEX or the surviving company or any of their respective subsidiaries following the completion of the initial merger, which
individuals are collectively referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Convergys employees, base compensation and
cash incentive compensation opportunities that, in each case, are no less favorable than the base compensation and cash incentive
compensation opportunities that were provided to such Convergys employee immediately before the completion of the initial
merger (it being understood that in the case of cash incentive compensation opportunity, the underlying performance metrics need
not be no less favorable than, or use the same type of metric as, those provided immediately before the completion of the initial
merger, so long as they are of substantially comparable achievability as determined in reasonable good faith by SYNNEX as those
provided immediately before the completion of the initial merger).

Effective as of the completion of the initial merger and during the eight-month period immediately following the completion of
the initial merger, SYNNEX will provide, or will cause the surviving company to provide, to each Convergys employee, employee
benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the employee benefits that were provided to such Convergys employee
immediately before the completion of the initial merger; provided, however, that nothing included in this paragraph will prevent
SYNNEX from making modifications to the employee benefits offered to its U.S. employees, including Convergys employees, at
SYNNEX’ next open enrollment, which will be effective for the policy year starting on July 1, 2019. SYNNEX

will provide, or will cause the surviving company to provide, to each Convergys employee whose employment is involuntarily
terminated by Convergys during the two-year period following the completion of the initial merger, the severance benefits, if any,
that would have been provided to such Convergys employee under Convergys’ severance arrangements in effect immediately prior
to the completion of the initial merger.

Each Convergys employee who immediately prior to the completion of the initial merger is then participating in Convergys’
Annual Incentive Plans (AIP) (including the 2018 AIP adopted by resolution of the compensation and benefits committee of
Convergys’ board of directors) or other non-sales bonus plans for Convergys employees at the level of director and above, which are
collectively referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as bonus plans, will be entitled to receive an annual bonus payment
in respect of fiscal year 2018 pursuant to the terms of the applicable bonus plan and hereof so long as such Convergys employee
remains employed by Convergys or a subsidiary thereof continuously up to and including December 31, 2018; provided, that a
Convergys employee who experiences a severance-qualifying termination of employment under a severance plan of Convergys and
its affiliates (or, in the case of a Convergys employee employed outside of the United States, pursuant to applicable law) on or after
the closing of the mergers and on or before December 31, 2018 will be entitled to receive the annual bonus payment in respect of
fiscal year 2018 that would otherwise be payable to such Convergys employee pursuant to the terms hereof, prorated to reflect the
percentage of 2018 elapsed through the date of such termination of employment; but, provided, further, that such prorated payment
will be reduced (but not below zero) by any prorated bonus in respect of fiscal year 2018 to which the applicable Convergys
employee is entitled pursuant to a severance plan of Convergys and its affiliates (or, in the case of a Convergys employee employed
outside of the United States, pursuant to applicable law). The amount of each bonus payment will be based on the actual level of
achievement of the applicable performance goals established under the applicable bonus plan in respect of fiscal year 2018 (with
such determination of performance to exclude any costs relating to the mergers, as applicable), as determined by SYNNEX in
accordance with the applicable bonus plan; provided, however, that (i) a Convergys employee’s bonus amount will be no less than
80% of such Convergys employee’s target bonus payment amount, and (ii) in the event that the actual level of achievement of the
applicable performance goals meets or exceeds the target level of achievement, the target bonus payment will be increased by 10%
of the amount provided for under the terms of the applicable bonus plan. Annual bonuses for Convergys’ 2018 fiscal year will be
paid at the same time that SYNNEX pays annual bonuses in respect of its fiscal year ending November 30, 2018 to its employees,
but in no event will payment be made later than March 15, 2019. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing (but
notwithstanding the payment timing set forth in the immediately preceding sentence), in the event that the completion of the initial
merger has not occurred prior to January 1, 2019, annual bonuses for Convergys’ 2018 fiscal year will be determined by Convergys
in accordance with this paragraph as if the closing of the mergers had occurred immediately prior to the conclusion of such fiscal
year and paid by Convergys at the time that Convergys normally pays annual bonuses in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, or, at Convergys’ election, immediately prior to the closing of the mergers.

Following the closing date of the mergers, SYNNEX will, or will cause the surviving company to, cause any employee benefit
or compensation plans sponsored or maintained by SYNNEX or the surviving company or their subsidiaries in which Convergys
employees are eligible to participate following the closing date of the mergers, which are collectively referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as post-closing plans, to recognize the service of each Convergys employee with Convergys and its
subsidiaries (and any predecessor thereto) prior to the closing date of the mergers for purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of
benefits under such post-closing plans; provided, that such recognition of service will not apply (i) for purposes of benefit accrual
under any post-closing plan that is a final average pay defined benefit retirement plan, or (ii) to the extent that such crediting would
result in a duplication of benefits. With respect to any post-closing plan that provides medical, dental or vision insurance benefits,
for the plan year in which such Convergys employee is first eligible to participate, SYNNEX will (A) cause any preexisting
condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be waived with respect to such Convergys employee to the
extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Convergys employee benefit plan in which such Convergys
employee participated immediately prior to the completion of the initial merger and (B) credit each Convergys employee for any co-
payments or deductibles incurred by such Convergys employee in such plan year for purposes of any applicable deductible and
annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such post-closing plan. Such credited expenses will also count toward any
annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply under the terms of the applicable plan.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the merger agreement, with respect to any Convergys employees who
are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, labor union contract, trade union agreement or who are based outside of the
United States, SYNNEX’ obligations will be in addition to, and not in contravention of, any obligations under the applicable
collective bargaining agreement, labor union contract, trade union agreement or under the laws of the foreign countries and political
subdivisions thereof in which such Convergys employees are based.

SYNNEX acknowledged under the merger agreement that a “change in control” of Convergys or other event with similar
import, within the meaning of the Convergys employee benefit plans that contain such terms, will occur upon the completion of the
initial merger.

Regulatory Approvals

Prior to the closing of the mergers, SYNNEX, the Merger Subs and Convergys will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any
applicable laws to consummate and make effective the mergers as promptly as practicable, including (i) preparing and filing all
forms, registrations and notifications required to be filed to consummate the mergers, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to satisfy the
conditions to consummating the mergers, (iii) using reasonable best efforts to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining)
any consent, authorization, expiration or termination of a waiting period, permit, order or approval of, waiver or any exemption by,
any governmental authority (including furnishing all information and documentary material required under the HSR Act) required to
be obtained or made by SYNNEX, either Merger Sub, Convergys or any of their respective subsidiaries in connection with the
mergers or the taking of any action contemplated by the merger agreement, (iv) using reasonable best efforts to defend any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the
mergers and (v) the execution and delivery of any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate the mergers and to
fully carry out the purposes of the merger agreement. Early termination under the HSR Act was granted, effective on July 30, 2018.

None of SYNNEX nor either Merger Sub has any obligation to, or to cause any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or
Convergys to: (A) sell, license, divest or dispose of or hold separate the assets, intellectual property or businesses of any entity; (B)
terminate, amend or assign any existing relationships or contractual rights or obligations of any entity; (C) change or modify any
course of conduct regarding future operations of any entity; (D) otherwise take any action that would limit the freedom of action
with respect to, or the ability to retain, one or more businesses, assets or rights of any entity or interests therein; or (E) commit to
take any such action in the foregoing clause (A), (B), (C) or (D). Notwithstanding the foregoing, SYNNEX and the Merger Subs
will take the actions in the foregoing clause (A), (B), (C), (D) and/or (E) if such actions (1) are necessary to permit the closing of the
mergers to occur as promptly as practicable and in any event before the end date and (2) would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be have a material adverse effect on SYNNEX and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to
the mergers (assuming SYNNEX and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the mergers, were the size of
Convergys and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, prior to giving effect to the mergers).

SYNNEX and Convergys will each keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the mergers
and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, orders or approvals of, or any exemptions
by, any governmental authority undertaken pursuant to the foregoing. In that regard, prior to the closing of the mergers, each party
will promptly consult with the other party with respect to and provide any necessary information and assistance as the other party
may reasonably request with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other party (or their counsel) with copies of)
all notices, submissions or filings made by or on behalf of such party or any of its affiliates with any governmental authority or any
other information supplied by or on behalf of such party or any of its affiliates to, or correspondence with, a governmental authority
in connection with the merger agreement and the mergers. Each party to the merger agreement will promptly inform the other party,
and if in writing, furnish the other party with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other party orally of) any
communication from or to any governmental authority regarding the mergers, and permit the other party to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed communication or submission
with any such governmental authority. Neither SYNNEX nor Convergys nor any of their respective affiliates will participate in any
meeting or teleconference with any governmental authority in

connection with the merger agreement and the mergers unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such governmental authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, SYNNEX and Convergys may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive material provided to the other as “Antitrust Counsel Only Material.” Such materials and the information contained therein
will be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (SYNNEX or
Convergys, as the case may be) or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, materials provided may be redacted
(i) to remove references concerning the valuation of Convergys and the mergers, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

Convergys and SYNNEX will make or file, as promptly as practicable, with the appropriate governmental authority all filings,
forms, registrations and notifications required to be filed to consummate the mergers under any applicable antitrust law, and
subsequent to such filings, Convergys and SYNNEX will, and will cause their respective affiliates to, as promptly as practicable,
respond to inquiries from governmental authorities, or provide any supplemental information that may be requested by
governmental authorities, in connection with filings made with such governmental authorities. Each of SYNNEX and Convergys
filed its required HSR Act notification and report with respect to the mergers on July 19, 2018, and the request for early termination
of the HSR Act waiting period was granted effective on July 30, 2018.

If requested by SYNNEX, Convergys will agree to any action contemplated by the foregoing if any such agreement or action is
conditioned on the consummation of the mergers. However, in no event will Convergys or its affiliates propose, negotiate, effect or
agree to any such actions without the prior written consent of SYNNEX.

Indemnification and Insurance

The merger agreement provides that, from and after the effective time of the initial merger, the surviving company and
SYNNEX will indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors, officers and employees of Convergys or any of its
subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, managing member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request or for the benefit of Convergys or
any of its subsidiaries (which individuals, together with such persons’ heirs, executors and administrators, are collectively referred
to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as covered persons) to the fullest extent permitted by law as provided in Convergys’
organizational documents or similar governing documents of Convergys’ subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of the
merger agreement, or pursuant to any other contracts in effect on the date of the merger agreement and disclosed in Convergys’
confidential disclosure schedule delivered to SYNNEX concurrently with execution of the merger agreement, which are collectively
referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as indemnification contracts, against any costs and expenses (including
advancing attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
covered person to the fullest extent permitted by law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened proceeding brought by a governmental authority or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the completion of the initial
merger (including acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity at
the request or for the benefit of Convergys).

Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the effective time of the initial merger, SYNNEX and the surviving company
will indemnify and hold harmless covered persons to the fullest extent permitted by law as provided in Convergys’ organizational
documents or similar governing documents of Convergys’ subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of the merger
agreement, or pursuant to any indemnification contract for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the process resulting in
and the adoption and approval of the merger agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement. From and after the effective time of the initial merger, SYNNEX, Convergys and the surviving company will advance
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any proceeding brought by a governmental
authority or investigation with respect to the matters subject to indemnification in accordance with the procedures (if any) set forth
in Convergys’ organizational documents, the certificate or articles of incorporation and code of regulations or bylaws, or other
organizational or governance documents, of any

subsidiary of Convergys, and indemnification contracts. In the event of any such proceeding brought by a governmental authority or
investigation, SYNNEX and the surviving company will cooperate with covered persons in the defense of any such proceeding
brought by a governmental authority or investigation.

For not less than six years from and after the effective time of the initial merger, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the surviving company will contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
exculpation, indemnification of and advancement of expenses to covered persons for periods at or prior to the effective time of the
initial merger than are currently set forth in Convergys’ organizational documents. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if any
proceeding brought by a governmental authority or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the effective time of the initial
merger) is made against such persons with respect to matters subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the effective time of the initial merger, this paragraph will continue in effect until the final disposition of such
proceeding brought by a governmental authority or investigation. Following the effective time of the initial merger, the
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of the merger agreement with any of the directors, officers or employees
of Convergys or any its subsidiaries will be assumed by the surviving company, without any further action, and will continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms.

For not less than six years from and after the effective time of the initial merger, the surviving company will, and SYNNEX
will cause the surviving company to, maintain for the benefit of the directors and officers of Convergys and its subsidiaries, as of the
date of the merger agreement and as of the effective time of the initial merger, an insurance and indemnification policy that provides
coverage for events occurring prior to the effective time of the initial merger that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not
less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policies of Convergys and its subsidiaries or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, that the surviving company will not be required to pay an annual
premium for such insurance and indemnification policy in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of the
merger agreement, but in such case will purchase as much coverage as is available for such amount. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence will be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the effective
time of the initial merger (which Convergys will be permitted to purchase prior to the effective time of the initial merger at a price
of no more than 300% of the last annual premium for each year of coverage), which policies provide such directors and officers with
coverage for an aggregate period of at least six years from and after the effective time of the initial merger with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the effective time of the initial merger, including in respect of the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the effective time of the initial merger,
the surviving company will, and SYNNEX will cause the surviving company to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

In the event that SYNNEX or the surviving company (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and will not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any person, then proper provision will be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or transferee
of such assets, as the case may be, will assume the indemnification obligations set forth herein.

The foregoing obligations will not be terminated or modified in any manner that is adverse to covered persons (and their
respective successors and assigns), it being expressly agreed that covered persons (including their respective successors and assigns)
are third party beneficiaries of the indemnification provisions. In the event of any breach by the surviving company or SYNNEX of
any indemnification provision, the surviving company will pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys’ fees, that may be
incurred by covered person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided herein as such fees are incurred, upon the
written request of such covered person.

From and after the effective time of the initial merger, the surviving company will assume all remaining obligations of
Convergys relating to indemnification set forth in Section 5.08 of the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among Convergys,
Comet Merger Co., SGS Holdings, Inc. and the Sellers listed on Schedule I thereto, dated January 6, 2014.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Tax Matters

The merger agreement requires each of SYNNEX and Convergys (and their respective affiliates) to use their reasonable best
efforts to take all actions, and do and to assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things reasonably necessary to permit
the mergers, taken together, to qualify as a “reorganization” within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

Financing

Financing Not a Condition to the Mergers

On August 9, 2018, SYNNEX entered into the takeout facility, pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have committed to
provide a $1.8 billion 5-year senior secured term loan A facility. The lenders’ obligation to fund the term loan under the takeout
facility is subject to several conditions as set forth in the takeout facility, including, among others, completion of the mergers, the
non-occurrence of a material adverse effect on Convergys, the accuracy of certain representations and warranties related to both
SYNNEX and Convergys and SYNNEX’ and Convergys’ delivery of certain financial statements.

The availability of the term loan under the takeout facility is not a condition to SYNNEX’ or either Merger Sub’s obligations
under the merger agreement.

Cooperation of Convergys

Convergys has agreed to, and to cause its subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with SYNNEX as
necessary in connection with the arrangement of debt financing as may be customary and reasonably requested by SYNNEX in
writing, including using commercially reasonable efforts to, upon the request of SYNNEX:

• make appropriate officers or members of the management team (with appropriate seniority and expertise) available for
participation at reasonable times in a reasonable number of meetings, lender presentations, conference calls, meetings with
prospective lenders and ratings agencies;

• (A) furnish to SYNNEX certain financial information, (B) provide reasonable assistance in the preparation of any
reasonable and customary bank information memoranda (including using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
customary authorization letters with respect to the information specific to Convergys or any of its subsidiaries to be
reasonably included in any such bank information memoranda from a senior officer of Convergys) or private placement
memoranda, rating agency presentations, marketing and/or syndication materials and cooperate reasonably with the debt
financing sources’ due diligence, in each case with respect to Convergys and its subsidiaries and to the extent customary
and reasonable, and (C) assist SYNNEX in the preparation by SYNNEX of customary pro forma financial statements and
projections necessary in connection with the debt financing, it being understood that SYNNEX will be solely responsible
for any pro forma cost savings, synergies, capitalization, ownership or other post-closing pro forma adjustments;

• assist in the preparation and negotiation and execution and delivery as of the closing of the mergers of any definitive
financing documents (including any schedules and exhibits thereto) as may be reasonably requested by SYNNEX
including, without limitation, customary certificates;

• facilitate the pledging of, and granting of security interests in, the collateral in connection with the debt financing,
including using commercially reasonable efforts to execute and deliver as of the closing of the mergers any customary
pledge and security documents or other definitive financing documents, in each case as may be reasonably requested by
SYNNEX;

• cause the taking of corporate and other actions by Convergys and its subsidiaries reasonably necessary to permit the
consummation of the debt financing on the closing date of the mergers;

• provide at least three business days prior to the closing date of the mergers (provided that SYNNEX has made such
request at least nine days prior to the closing date of the mergers) all material documentation and other information about
Convergys as is reasonably requested by SYNNEX to satisfy applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act;

forma financial information or (B) projections (provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, Convergys will assist SYNNEX
in SYNNEX’ preparation of pro forma financial information or projections in accordance with clause (C) of the second
bullet above); and

audit of Convergys’ financial statements.

In addition, the merger agreement provides that it does not require Convergys or any of its subsidiaries, prior to the closing of
the mergers, to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the debt financing. SYNNEX will, promptly upon request by Convergys,
reimburse Convergys for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Convergys or its subsidiaries

such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely, to harm, disparage or otherwise adversely affect

Termination Fees and Expenses

Termination Fee Payable by Convergys

Convergys has agreed to pay SYNNEX a termination fee of $74.0 million if:

• the merger agreement is terminated by Convergys at any time prior to the receipt of the Convergys shareholder approval,
in accordance with the second to last paragraph of “—No Solicitation,” in which case the termination fee will be payable
in immediately available funds prior to or concurrently with such termination;

• the merger agreement is terminated by SYNNEX at any time prior to the receipt of the Convergys shareholder approval, in
the event of an adverse recommendation change or in the event of a material breach by Convergys of any of its covenants
or agreements described under “—Obligations to Recommend the Adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Approval of
the Stock Issuance” and “—No Solicitation,” which breach Convergys knew or should have known was a breach of such
covenants or agreements, in which case the termination fee will be payable in immediately available funds within two
business days of such termination; or

• (i) after the date of the merger agreement, a takeover proposal (substituting 50% for the 20% threshold set forth in the
definition of “takeover proposal”), which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as a qualifying transaction,
has been publicly made and not withdrawn at least four business days prior to the Convergys special meeting (or any
adjournment or postponement thereof), (ii) thereafter the merger agreement is terminated by SYNNEX or Convergys
because Convergys shareholders fail to adopt the merger agreement upon a vote taken on a proposal to adopt the merger
agreement at the Convergys special meeting and (iii) at any time on or prior to the 12-month anniversary of such
termination, Convergys or any of its subsidiaries completes or enters into a definitive agreement with respect to such
qualifying transaction, for which (x) one half of the termination fee will be payable in immediately available funds upon
entering into a definitive agreement with respect to such a qualifying transaction and (y) if Convergys subsequently
consummates such a qualifying transaction, the remaining half of the termination fee will be payable upon such
consummation; provided, that any expense reimbursement actually paid by Convergys described below under “—Expense
Reimbursement Payable by Convergys” will be credited against, and will reduce, the amount of the termination fee (or
portion thereof payable) that otherwise would be required to be paid by Convergys to SYNNEX.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the full termination fee will become due and payable in accordance with the
foregoing, from and after such termination and payment of the termination fee in full pursuant to and in accordance with the
foregoing, Convergys will have no further liability of any kind for any reason in connection with the merger agreement or the
termination contemplated by the merger agreement other than as set forth under “—Termination Fees and Expenses” other than for
fraud or breach of any of its representations, warranties, agreements or covenants that Convergys knew or should have known was a
breach of such representation, warranty, agreement or covenant. Convergys will not be required to pay the termination fee on more

THE VOTING AGREEMENT

The following is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the voting agreement. This summary may not contain all
the information about the voting agreement that is important to you. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
voting agreement attached as Annex D to, and incorporated by reference into, this joint proxy statement/prospectus. You are
encouraged to read the voting agreement in its entirety because it is the legal document that governs the matters discussed in the
summary below.

Agreement to Vote and Irrevocable Proxy

Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, SYNNEX entered into a voting agreement with Convergys’ chief
executive officer, chief financial officer and all of Convergys’ directors, which are collectively referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as the voting agreement shareholders. The Convergys common shares beneficially owned by the voting
agreement shareholders subject to the voting agreement constituted approximately 1.2% of the total issued and outstanding
Convergys common shares as of August 23, 2018.

Pursuant to the voting agreement, each voting agreement shareholder irrevocably and unconditionally agreed that at any
meeting (whether annual or special and each postponement, recess, adjournment or continuation thereof) of Convergys
shareholders, such voting agreement shareholder shall (i) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause all of his or her Convergys
common shares as of the date of the voting agreement, and all other Convergys common shares over which he or she has acquired
beneficial or record ownership and the power to vote or direct the voting thereof after the date of the voting agreement and prior to
the applicable record date, which, together with the existing Convergys common shares as of the date of the voting agreement, are
referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as the voting shares, to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a
quorum and (ii) vote or cause to be voted all of his or her voting shares in favor of (A) the adoption of the merger agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, including the mergers and (B) any proposal to adjourn or postpone such
meeting of Convergys’ shareholders to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to approve the merger agreement and in favor of
any advisory, non-binding compensation proposal set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and submitted to the
shareholders of Convergys in connection with the mergers.

Further, the voting agreement shareholders have agreed to vote against (i) any action or proposal in favor of a takeover
proposal, (ii) any action or proposal that could reasonably be expected to interfere with or delay the timely consummation of the
mergers and (iii) any amendments to Convergys’ articles or Convergys’ code if such amendment would reasonably be expected to
prevent or delay the consummation of the closing of the mergers. Each voting agreement shareholder agreed not to enter into any
other voting agreement or voting trust with respect to his or her voting shares until the voting agreement is terminated.

In addition, each voting agreement shareholder irrevocably and unconditionally granted, and appointed, SYNNEX or any
designee of SYNNEX as such voting agreement shareholder’s proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in
the name, place and stead of such voting agreement shareholder, to vote or cause to be voted (including by proxy or written consent,
if applicable) the voting shares as of the applicable record date in accordance with the foregoing in certain circumstances.

Transfer Restrictions Prior to Initial Merger

Pursuant to the voting agreement, each voting agreement shareholder agreed that he or she will not, without the prior written
consent of SYNNEX, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, give, tender in any tender or exchange offer or similarly dispose of any of his or
her voting shares, or any interest therein, including the right to vote any of his or her voting agreement shares, as applicable, subject
to exceptions for (i) estate planning or philanthropic purposes or (ii) surrendering his or her voting shares to Convergys in
connection with the vesting, settlement or exercise of Company Equity Awards to satisfy any withholding for the payment of taxes
incurred in connection with such vesting, settlement or exercise, or, in respect of Company Options, the exercise price thereon.

Non-Solicitation

Each voting agreement shareholder acknowledged and agreed that such voting agreement shareholder has received a copy of
the merger agreement, has read the non-solicit provisions in the merger agreement and all related sections and understands the
obligations of the directors and officers of Convergys thereunder.

Termination

The voting agreement automatically terminates without any further action required by any person upon the earliest to occur of:
(a) the termination of the merger agreement in accordance with its terms, (b) the effective time of the initial merger and (c) an
adverse recommendation change. In addition, the voting agreement may be terminated with respect to any voting agreement

INTERESTS OF CONVERGYS’ DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN THE MERGERS

In considering the recommendation of Convergys’ board of directors that you vote to approve the merger proposal, you should
be aware that Convergys’ non-employee directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or
in addition to, those of Convergys shareholders generally. Convergys’ board of directors was aware of these interests and considered
them, among other matters, in reaching its decisions to approve the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and
to recommend that the shareholders of Convergys approve the merger proposal. The transactions contemplated by the merger
agreement will be a “change of control” for purposes of Convergys compensation and benefit plans described below. The following
discussion sets forth certain of these interests in the mergers of the Convergys executive officers, each of whom is also a named
executive officer, and non-employee directors.

Certain Assumptions

Except as otherwise specifically noted, for purposes of quantifying the potential payments and benefits described in this
section, the following assumptions were used:

• The relevant price per Convergys common share is $25.01, which is the average closing price of Convergys common
shares on the New York Stock Exchange over the five trading days immediately following the first public announcement
of the mergers on June 28, 2018;

• The completion of the initial merger is August 7, 2018, which is the assumed date of the closing of the mergers solely for
purposes of the disclosure in this section; and

• Each executive officer of Convergys experiences a qualifying termination, including a termination by Convergys without
“cause” or “good cause” or resignation by the executive officer for “good reason,” as such terms are defined in the
relevant Convergys compensation plans and agreements, immediately following the assumed completion of the initial
merger of August 7, 2018.

Equity Compensation

Treatment of Convergys Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards. Pursuant to the
merger agreement, at the completion of the initial merger, each Convergys restricted stock unit (“RSU”) award and performance-
based restricted stock unit (“PSU”) award that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the completion of the initial merger shall be
cancelled in consideration for the right to receive a cash payment (the “cash award amount”) equal to the product of (i) the number
of Convergys common shares subject to such Convergys RSU or PSU award as of immediately prior to the completion of the initial
merger (with respect to each Company PSU award, such number of shares shall equal the greater of the number of shares that would
be earned based upon target performance and the number of shares determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement,
with any associated performance determinations to be made by Convergys’ board of directors) and (ii) the cash equivalent merger
consideration (or, if higher, a cash amount equal to the average of the opening and closing prices per Convergys common share on
the New York Stock Exchange on the trading day immediately preceding the closing date). As used in this section, the term “cash
equivalent merger consideration” means the sum of (1) $13.25, plus (2) the number of shares of SYNNEX common stock equal to
the exchange ratio, multiplied by (y) the SYNNEX closing price.

The merger agreement provides that each cash award amount shall be paid as promptly as practicable following the completion
of the initial merger, subject to the following two exceptions: (i) each cash award amount payable in respect of a Convergys RSU or
PSU award granted on or after March 31, 2016 (other than any such Convergys RSU or PSU award that is held by a non-employee
director or that becomes vested at the completion of the initial merger pursuant to the terms of an applicable contract) will remain
unvested as of the completion of the initial merger and continue to vest and be paid in accordance with the terms of the applicable
award agreement, and (ii) each cash award payable in respect of a Convergys RSU or PSU award which constitutes nonqualified
deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be paid at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such
award that will not result in the application of a tax or penalty under Section 409A. Cash award amounts that remain unvested
following the completion of the initial merger will vest in full pursuant to the terms of such awards upon the applicable award
holder ceasing to be an employee of Convergys and its affiliates by reason of the award holder’s death, disability, involuntary
termination by Convergys without good cause, or resignation for good reason, in each case prior to the applicable vesting date for
such cash award amount.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Pursuant to the terms of the separation and consulting agreement entered into between Convergys and Andrea Ayers, its Chief
Executive Officer, on February 20, 2018, the cash award amount in respect of each of Ms. Ayers’ Convergys RSU and PSU awards
will become vested upon a change of control.

Quantification of Equity Compensation. See “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Convergys Named
Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers” for an estimate of the amounts that may become payable to each of Convergys’
executive officers in respect of their unvested equity awards. Based on the assumptions described above under “Interests of
Convergys’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers—Certain Assumptions,” the estimated aggregate amount that would
become payable upon the completion of the initial merger to Convergys’ eight non-employee directors in respect of their unvested
Convergys RSU awards is $1,009,454.

Executive Severance Arrangements

Upon a termination of employment by Convergys without cause or due to resignation for good reason, in each case, either in
anticipation of and within six months prior to, or during the two-year period immediately following, a change of control, each
executive officer is entitled to receive certain severance benefits under the Convergys Corporation Senior Executive Severance Pay
Plan (the “Severance Plan”), except that Cormac Twomey, Convergys’ chief commercial officer, does not participate in the
Severance Plan due to his status as a non-U.S. employee. Under the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Twomey is entitled to
receive severance benefits that are the same as those provided under the Severance Plan (except as noted below) on the same terms
set forth in the Severance Plan.

The applicable severance benefits for each executive officer include:

• cash severance equal to two times the sum of the executive officer’s base salary and target annual incentive plan award for
the year of termination;

• payment of a prorated portion of the executive officer’s target annual incentive plan award for the year of termination;

• continued medical, dental and vision benefits (if the officer elects COBRA) for 24 months following termination of
employment (except that Mr. Twomey is not entitled to receive this benefit); and

• outplacement services of up to $20,000 (except that Mr. Twomey is not entitled to receive this benefit).

The severance benefits described above are subject to the applicable officer providing a release of all claims against
Convergys.

In addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, if the applicable severance-qualifying termination occurs in 2018 and actual
performance under the 2018 annual incentive plan ultimately equals or exceeds target performance, the applicable executive officer
would receive an additional payment equal to the difference between (1) a prorated portion of the executive officer’s annual
incentive plan award for 2018, calculated in accordance with the merger agreement (see “The Merger Agreement—Employee
Matters”) and (2) the prorated bonus to which the executive officer is entitled under the Severance Plan, as described above;

The Severance Plan includes a “better net after-tax cutback” provision which provides that, in the event that any payments or
benefits to a Convergys executive officer (other than Mr. Twomey, who does not participate in the Severance Plan) in connection
with a change of control would be subject to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the payments and benefits due to such
executive officer under the Severance Plan will be reduced on a pro rata basis so that no portion of the payments or benefits due to
such executive officer in connection with the change of control will be subject to the excise tax, if that would result in a greater
aggregate amount being retained by the executive officer on an after-tax basis.

See “—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Convergys Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Mergers” for an estimate of the value of the severance benefits payable to each of the Convergys executive officers upon a
qualifying termination upon or following the completion of the initial merger.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Indemnification and Insurance

Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, Convergys non-employee directors and executive officers will be entitled to
certain ongoing indemnification and coverage under directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies following the mergers. Such
indemnification and insurance coverage is further described under “The Merger Agreement—Indemnification and Insurance.”

Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Convergys Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers

The information set forth in the table below is intended to comply with Item 402(t) of the SEC’s Regulation S-K, which
requires disclosure of information about certain compensation for each named executive officer of Convergys that will or may be
paid or become payable and that is based on, or otherwise relates to, the mergers. The amounts shown in the table below are
estimates based on multiple assumptions that may or may not actually occur or be accurate on the relevant date, including the
assumptions described below and in the footnotes to the table, and do not reflect certain compensation actions or events that may
occur before completion of the mergers. For purposes of calculating such amounts, the following assumptions were used:

• The relevant price per Convergys common share is $25.01, which is the average closing price of Convergys common
shares on the New York Stock Exchange over the five trading days immediately following the first public announcement
of the mergers on June 28, 2018;

• The completion of the initial merger is August 7, 2018, which is the assumed date of the closing of the mergers solely for
purposes of the disclosure in this section;

• Each named executive officer of Convergys experiences a qualifying termination, including a termination by Convergys
without “cause” or “good cause” or resignation by such named executive officer for “good reason,” as such terms are
defined in the relevant Convergys compensation plans and agreements, immediately following the assumed completion of
the initial merger of August 7, 2018; and

• Payments and benefits will not be reduced pursuant to the better net after-tax cutback provision in the Severance Plan.

target annual incentive plan award for the year of termination, and (b) the prorated portion of the named executive officer’s annual incentive plan award for the
year of termination. For purposes of calculating the estimated prorated annual incentive plan awards, it was assumed that the actual level of performance under
the annual incentive plan for 2018 equals the target level, resulting under the merger agreement in each named executive officer receiving a prorated portion of
110% of such named executive officer’s target annual incentive plan award. For further details on the prorated bonus amounts to which the named executive
officers would be entitled on a qualifying termination of employment, see “—Executive Severance Arrangements” and “The Merger Agreement—Employee
Matters.” Such payments are “double trigger” and payable upon a qualifying termination of employment either in anticipation of and within six months prior

CONVERGYS PROPOSAL II: ADJOURNMENT OF THE CONVERGYS SPECIAL MEETING

Convergys shareholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give Convergys’ board of directors authority to adjourn
from time to time the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt
the merger agreement at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. Any determination
of whether it is necessary to adjourn the Convergys special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) to solicit
additional proxies will be made solely by Convergys consistent with the terms of the merger agreement or with the consent of
SYNNEX.

If this proposal is approved, the Convergys special meeting could be adjourned to any date. If the Convergys special meeting is
adjourned, Convergys shareholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to revoke them at any time prior to their
use. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on the adjournment proposal, your shares will be voted
in favor of the adjournment proposal. But if you indicate that you wish to vote against the adoption of the merger agreement, your
shares will only be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of that proposal.

To approve the adjournment from time to time of the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if
there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof (whether or not a quorum is present) requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
Convergys common shares present or represented by proxy at the Convergys special meeting.

Convergys’ board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the adjournment from time to time of
the Convergys special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger
agreement at the time of the Convergys special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

CONVERGYS PROPOSAL III: ADVISORY VOTE ON MERGER-RELATED
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

Convergys is providing its shareholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve compensation
that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers, as required by the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.

The compensation that Convergys’ named executive officers may be entitled to receive from Convergys in connection with the
mergers is summarized in the first table under “Interests of Convergys’ Directors and Executive Officers in the Mergers—
Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Convergys Named Executive Officers in Connection with the Mergers.” That
summary includes all compensation and benefits that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers
in connection with the mergers, including as a result of a termination of employment in connection with the mergers.

Convergys’ board of directors encourages you to review carefully the information regarding compensation that will or may be
paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers disclosed in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus.

Convergys’ board of directors unanimously recommends that the shareholders of Convergys approve the following resolution:

“RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Convergys approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, compensation that will or may
be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers, as disclosed pursuant to Item
402(t) of Regulation S-K in the tables included in the section entitled “Interests of Convergys’ Directors and Executive Officers in
the Mergers—Quantification of Potential Payments and Benefits to Convergys Named Executive Officers in Connection with the
Mergers” and the related narrative disclosures.”

The vote on the proposal to approve compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive
officers in connection with the mergers is a vote separate and apart from the vote on the adoption of the merger agreement.
Accordingly, you may vote to approve the adoption of the merger agreement and vote not to approve this proposal and vice versa.
Because the vote on the proposal to approve compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named
executive officers in connection with the mergers is advisory only, it will not be binding on either Convergys or SYNNEX.
Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted and the mergers are completed, the compensation payments that are contractually
required to be paid by Convergys to its named executive officers will or may be paid, subject only to the conditions applicable
thereto, regardless of the outcome of the advisory (non-binding) vote of Convergys shareholders.

The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the Convergys common shares present or represented by proxy at
the Convergys special meeting will be required to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the proposal to approve
compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in connection with the mergers.

Convergys’ board of directors unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” the approval, on an advisory (non-
binding) basis, of compensation that will or may be paid or provided by Convergys to its named executive officers in
connection with the mergers.

SYNNEX PROPOSAL II: ADJOURNMENT OF THE SYNNEX SPECIAL MEETING

SYNNEX stockholders are being asked to approve a proposal that will give SYNNEX’ board of directors authority to adjourn
the SYNNEX special meeting one or more times if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve
the stock issuance at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof. If this proposal is
approved, the SYNNEX special meeting could be adjourned to any date. Any determination of whether it is necessary to adjourn the
SYNNEX special meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) to solicit additional proxies will be made solely by
SYNNEX consistent with the terms of the merger agreement or with the consent of Convergys.

If the SYNNEX special meeting is adjourned, SYNNEX stockholders who have already submitted their proxies will be able to
revoke them at any time prior to their use. If you sign and return a proxy and do not indicate how you wish to vote on any proposal,
or if you indicate that you wish to vote in favor of the approval of the stock issuance but do not indicate a choice on the adjournment
proposal, your shares will be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal. But if you indicate that you wish to vote against the
approval of the stock issuance, your shares will only be voted in favor of the adjournment proposal if you indicate that you wish to
vote in favor of that proposal.

The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present at the SYNNEX special meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to
vote will be required to approve the adjournment of the SYNNEX special meeting.

SYNNEX’ board of directors unanimously recommends that SYNNEX stockholders vote “FOR” the adjournment of
the SYNNEX special meeting if necessary to solicit additional proxies if there are not sufficient votes to approve the stock
issuance at the time of the SYNNEX special meeting, or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DESCRIPTION OF SYNNEX CAPITAL STOCK

The following description of the terms of SYNNEX capital stock is a summary only and is qualified by reference to the
relevant provisions of Delaware law, SYNNEX’ charter and SYNNEX’ bylaws. Copies of SYNNEX’ charter and SYNNEX’
bylaws are incorporated by reference and will be sent to holders of Convergys common shares free of charge upon written or
telephonic request. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”

Authorized Capital Stock

Under SYNNEX’ charter, the total number of shares of all classes of shares that SYNNEX has authority to issue is
105,000,000, having a par value of $0.001 each. At August 23, 2018, the authorized capital stock of SYNNEX consisted of
100,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock. Except as otherwise provided in
SYNNEX’ charter or in a board resolution, shares purchased, redeemed by, surrendered to or otherwise acquired by SYNNEX
assume the status of authorized but unissued shares, undesignated as to class or series, and may thereafter be reissued in the same
manner as other authorized but unissued shares.

SYNNEX Common Stock

The holders of shares of SYNNEX common stock are entitled to dividends as SYNNEX’ board of directors may declare from
time to time from legally available funds subject to the preferential rights of the holders of any shares of SYNNEX preferred stock
that may be issued in the future. The holders of shares of SYNNEX common stock are entitled to one vote per share on any matter
to be voted upon by SYNNEX stockholders.

SYNNEX’ charter does not provide for cumulative voting in connection with the election of directors. Accordingly, directors
are elected by a plurality of the shares of SYNNEX common stock voting once a quorum is present. No holder of shares of
SYNNEX common stock will have any preemptive right to subscribe for any shares of SYNNEX capital stock issued in the future.

Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of SYNNEX’ affairs, the holders of shares of
SYNNEX common stock are entitled to share, on a pro rata basis, all assets remaining after payment to creditors and subject to prior
distribution rights of any shares of SYNNEX preferred stock that may be issued in the future. All of the outstanding shares of
common stock are, and the shares issued in connection with the initial merger will be, fully paid and non-assessable.

Preferred Stock

Under SYNNEX’ charter, SYNNEX’ board of directors, without further action by the SYNNEX stockholders, will be
authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series. SYNNEX’ board of directors may fix the rights,
preferences and privileges of the preferred stock, along with any limitations or restrictions, including voting rights, dividend rights,
conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation preferences of each class or series of preferred stock. The shares of
SYNNEX preferred stock could have voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of
holders of shares of SYNNEX common stock. The issuance of shares of SYNNEX preferred stock could also have the effect, under
certain circumstances, of delaying, deferring or preventing a takeover or other transaction that holders of some or a majority of
shares of SYNNEX common stock might believe to be in their best interests or in which holders might receive a premium for their
shares over the then-market price of the shares. SYNNEX currently has no plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.

Certain Anti-Takeover, Limited Liability and Indemnification Provisions

SYNNEX’ charter and bylaws described below may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another person from
acquiring control of SYNNEX.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SYNNEX Charter and Bylaw Provisions

SYNNEX’ charter and SYNNEX’ bylaws include provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a
change in control or an unsolicited acquisition proposal that a SYNNEX stockholder might consider favorable, including a proposal
that might result in the payment of a premium over the market price for the shares held by SYNNEX stockholders. These provisions
are summarized in the following paragraphs.

• Supermajority Voting. SYNNEX’ charter requires the approval of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of SYNNEX’ combined
voting power to effect certain amendments to SYNNEX’ charter. SYNNEX’ bylaws may be amended by either a majority
of SYNNEX’ board of directors, or the holders of 66 2/3% of the SYNNEX voting stock.

• Authorized but Unissued or Undesignated Capital Stock. The SYNNEX authorized capital stock consists of 100,000,000
shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. No preferred stock will be designated upon
consummation of the mergers. After the mergers, SYNNEX estimates that it will have outstanding approximately
50,916,365 shares of SYNNEX common stock excluding the potential issuance of shares upon conversion of the
convertible debentures. The authorized but unissued (and in the case of preferred stock, undesignated) shares of SYNNEX
stock may be issued by SYNNEX’ board of directors in one or more transactions. In this regard, SYNNEX’ charter grants
SYNNEX’ board of directors broad power to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued preferred
stock. The issuance of shares of SYNNEX preferred stock pursuant to SYNNEX’ board of directors’ authority described
above could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of shares of SYNNEX
common stock and adversely affect the rights and powers, including voting rights, of such holders and may have the effect
of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control. SYNNEX’ board of directors does not currently intend to seek
SYNNEX stockholder approval prior to any issuance of preferred stock, unless otherwise required by law.

• Special Meetings of Stockholders. SYNNEX’ charter and SYNNEX’ bylaws provide that special meetings of SYNNEX
stockholders may be called by the chairman of SYNNEX’ board of directors or by a majority of SYNNEX’ board of
directors.

• No Stockholder Action by Written Consent. SYNNEX’ charter and SYNNEX’ bylaws provide that an action required or
permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of SYNNEX stockholders may only be taken at a duly called annual
or special meeting of SYNNEX stockholders. This provision prevents SYNNEX stockholders from initiating or effecting
any action by written consent, and thereby taking actions opposed by SYNNEX’ board of directors.

• Notice Procedures. SYNNEX’ bylaws establish advance notice procedures with regard to all SYNNEX stockholder
proposals to be brought before meetings of SYNNEX stockholders, including proposals relating to the nomination of
candidates for election as directors, the removal of directors and amendments to SYNNEX’ charter or SYNNEX’ bylaws.
These procedures provide that notice of such SYNNEX stockholder proposals must be timely given in writing to the
SYNNEX Secretary prior to the meeting. The notice must contain certain information specified in SYNNEX’ bylaws.

Other Anti-Takeover Provisions

SYNNEX’ charter limits the liability of the SYNNEX directors (in their capacity as directors but not in their capacity as
officers) to SYNNEX or SYNNEX stockholders to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Specifically, SYNNEX directors
will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of a director’s fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability:

• For any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to SYNNEX or SYNNEX stockholders;

• For acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

• Under Section 174 of the DGCL, which relates to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or
redemption; or

• For any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

Indemnification Arrangements

SYNNEX’ bylaws provide that SYNNEX directors and officers will be indemnified and provide for the advancement to them
of expenses in connection with actual or threatened proceedings and claims arising out of their status as such to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL. SYNNEX has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its directors and executive officers that
provide them with rights to indemnification and expense advancement to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL.

STOCKHOLDER NOMINATIONS

    
Under Convergys’ governance principles, candidates
recommended by shareholders are evaluated in the same
manner as candidates recommended by others. To recommend
an individual for nomination, a shareholder must submit the
candidate to the Governance and Nominating Committee by
certified mail.
   
Convergys’ governance principles establish requirements for
nominee recommendations, including a letter certifying that the
person making the recommendation is a shareholder and
providing the name, address and biographical history of the
proposed nominee and a signed statement from the candidate
consenting to be named as a nominee and, if nominated and
elected, to serve as a director. Under Convergys’ governance
principles, recommendations for nominees for election must be
received by Convergys before the close of business on
November 15th of the year before the next annual meeting.

Under SYNNEX’ bylaws, the nomination of persons for election
to SYNNEX’ board of directors may be made by any stockholder
of record of SYNNEX entitled to vote for the election of directors
at the annual meeting who complies with the applicable notice
procedures. Any such nomination must be made pursuant to
timely notice in writing to the secretary of SYNNEX.
   
Under SYNNEX’ bylaws, to be timely, a stockholder’s notice
must be delivered personally or deposited in the United States
mail, or delivered to a common carrier for transmission to the

PROXY ACCESS

    
Convergys’ code does not provide for a proxy access provision. SYNNEX’ bylaws do not provide for a proxy access provision.
    
    

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS AND OTHER STOCKHOLDER PROTECTIONS
    
The Ohio Control Share Acquisition Act generally prohibits a
“control share acquisition” unless the shareholders approve the
transaction at a special meeting, at which a quorum is present,
by both the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding
voting power of the corporation and by the affirmative vote of
a majority of the outstanding voting power of the corporation
excluding the voting power of interested shares. “Control share
acquisition” means any acquisition of an issuer’s shares which
would entitle the acquirer, immediately after such acquisition,
directly or indirectly, to exercise or direct the exercise of voting
power of the issuer in the election of directors within any of the
following ranges of such voting power: (1) one-fifth or more
but less than one-third of such voting power; (2) one-third or
more but less than a majority of such voting power; or (3) a
majority or more of such voting power. This act does not apply
to mergers approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least two-thirds of the voting power of Convergys.

SYNNEX has opted out of Section 203 of the DGCL which
prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a business
combination with a stockholder acquiring more than 15% but less
than 85% of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock for three
years following the time such stockholder becomes an “interested
stockholder,” unless, among other things, prior to such date the
board of directors approves either the business combination or
the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an
interested stockholder, or the business combination is approved
by the board of directors and by the affirmative vote of at least
66-2/3% of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the
interested stockholder.

    
Convergys’ articles do not contain any provisions altering these
standards.

Ohio’s merger moratorium statute prohibits certain transactions
(including disposition of assets, mergers and consolidations,
voluntary dissolutions and transfer of shares) between an Ohio
corporation with 50 or more shareholders and a beneficial
owner of 10% or more of the outstanding voting power of the
corporation, which is referred to in this joint proxy
statement/prospectus as an interested shareholder, for at least
three years after such interested shareholder attains 10%
ownership, unless the board of directors of the corporation
approves the transaction before such shareholder attains 10%
ownership. Subsequent to the three-year period, a business
combination may take place provided that certain conditions
are satisfied, including: (1) the board of directors approves the
transaction; (2) the transaction is approved by the holders of
shares with at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting power
of the corporation (or a different proportion set forth in
Convergys’ articles), including at least a majority of the
disinterested shareholders; or (3) the business combination
results in shareholders, other than the interested shareholder,
receiving a fair price plus interest for their shares.
    
Convergys has opted into the merger moratorium statute, but in
some circumstances, has adopted a higher voting proportion
than that required under the statute. Under Convergys’ articles,
subject to certain enumerated exceptions, an affirmative vote of
the holders of at least 80% of the outstanding voting power of
Convergys, voting at a meeting called for such purpose, is
required in the event of:

  

    
• any merger or consolidation of the corporation or of any

subsidiary with any interested shareholder or any other
corporation which would become, after such merger or
consolidation, an affiliate of an interested shareholder;

  

    
• any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or

other disposition to or with any interested shareholder or
any affiliate of any interested shareholder of any assets of
the corporation or of any subsidiary having an aggregate
fair market value of $5,000,000 or more;

  

    
• the issuance or transfer by the corporation or by any

subsidiary of any securities of the corporation or of any
subsidiary to any interested shareholder or to any affiliate
of any interested shareholder in exchange for cash,
securities or other property having an aggregate fair
market

which has the effect, directly or indirectly, of increasing
the proportionate share of the outstanding shares of any
class of equity or convertible securities of the corporation
or of any subsidiary which is owned by any interested

Convergys has also included in its definition of an “interested
shareholder” a person who is an affiliate of the corporation and
at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the
date in question was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of
the outstanding voting shares, or is an assignee of any
outstanding voting shares which were at any time within the

beneficially owned by any interested shareholder.

  

    
Pursuant to Ohio’s “anti-greenmail” statute, a public
corporation formed in Ohio may recover profits that a
shareholder makes from the sale of the corporation’s securities
within 18 months after making a proposal to acquire control or
publicly disclosing the possibility of a proposal to acquire
control. The corporation may not, however, recover from a
person who proves either: (1) that his sole purpose in making
the proposal was to succeed in acquiring control of the
corporation and there were reasonable grounds to believe that
he would acquire control of the corporation; or (2) that his
purpose was not to increase any profit or decrease any loss in
the shares. In addition, before the corporation may obtain any
recovery, the aggregate amount of the profit realized by such
person must exceed $250,000. Any shareholder may bring an
action on behalf of a corporation if the corporation refuses to
bring an action to recover these profits.

  

    
Convergys has not opted out of the “anti-greenmail” statute.

control bid for any securities of a “subject company” pursuant
to a tender offer must file information specified in the Ohio
Securities Act with the Ohio Division of Securities when the
bid commences. The Ohio Division of Securities must then
decide whether it will suspend the bid under the statute. If it
does so, it must make a determination within three calendar
days after the hearing has been completed and no later than 14
calendar days after the date on which the suspension is
imposed. For this purpose, a “control bid” is the purchase of, or
an offer to purchase, any equity security of a subject company
from a resident of Ohio that would, in general, result in the
offeror acquiring 10% or more of the outstanding shares of
such company. A “subject company” includes any company
with both: (1) its principal place of business or principal
executive office in Ohio or assets located in Ohio with a fair
market value of at least $1,000,000; and (2) more than 10% of
its record or beneficial equity security holders are resident in
Ohio, more than 10% of its equity securities are owned of
record or beneficially by Ohio residents, or more than 1,000 of
its record or beneficial equity security holders are resident in
Ohio.

  

    
LIMITATION OF PERSONAL LIABILITY OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

    
Under Ohio law, a director is not liable for monetary damages
unless it is proved by clear and convincing evidence that his
action or failure to act was undertaken with deliberate intent to
cause injury to the corporation or with reckless disregard for
the best interests of the corporation.

Under SYNNEX’ charter, directors of SYNNEX are not
personally liable to SYNNEX or its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for
liability (1) for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to
SYNNEX or its stockholders; (2) for acts or omissions not in
good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law; (3) under Section 174 of the DGCL (unlawful
payment of dividend or unlawful stock purchase or redemption);
or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived an
improper personal benefit.

    
INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS AND INSURANCE

    
Under the OGCL, a corporation may indemnify current and
former directors and officers from liability, other than in an
action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact
that the person is or was a director or officer, if such person
acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be
in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, if such
person had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct
was unlawful. In the case of an action by or in the right of a
corporation, a person may not be

SYNNEX’ charter and SYNNEX’ bylaws provide that SYNNEX
will, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, indemnify and
hold harmless any person who was or is a party or is threatened
to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative by reason of the fact that such person is or was a

indemnified (i) if the person seeking indemnification is found
liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of his
duty to the corporation, unless the court in which such action
was brought determines such person is fairly and reasonably
entitled to indemnification or (ii) if liability asserted against
such person concerns certain unlawful distributions. The
indemnification provisions of the OGCL require
indemnification of a director who has been successful on the
merits or otherwise in defense of any action that he was a party
to by reason of the fact that he is or was a director of the
corporation. The indemnification authorized by the OGCL is
not exclusive and is in addition to any other rights granted to
directors under the articles of incorporation or regulations of
the corporation or to any agreement between the directors and
the corporation.
   
Ohio law provides that a director (but not an officer, employee
or agent) of an Ohio corporation is entitled to mandatory
advancement of expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred in
defending any action, including derivative actions, brought
against the director, provided that the director agrees to
cooperate with the corporation concerning the matter and to
repay the amount advanced if it is proven by clear and
convincing evidence that the director’s act or failure to act was
done with deliberate intent to cause injury to the corporation or
with reckless disregard for the corporation’s best interests.
Advancement of expenses to officers, employees and agents on
the other hand is at the board’s discretion.
   
Under its code of regulations, Convergys may indemnify all
persons whom it may indemnify pursuant to the OGCL.

other enterprise, against expenses (including attorney’s fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such
action. The DGCL provides that such indemnification is subject
to such person seeking indemnification having acted in good faith
and in a manner that such person reasonably believed to be in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation, and with
respect to any criminal motion or proceeding, such person having
had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful.
SYNNEX’ charter provides that the foregoing right to
indemnification is a contract right and includes the right to be
paid by SYNNEX the expenses incurred in defending any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition, except that, if the
DGCL so requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a
current, former or proposed director or officer in his or her
capacity as a director or officer or proposed director or officer in
advance of the final disposition of a proceeding shall be made
only upon delivery to SYNNEX of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such person to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
be ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to be
indemnified under SYNNEX’ charter or otherwise. SYNNEX
may, by action of SYNNEX’ board of directors, provide
indemnification to employees and agents of SYNNEX,
individually or as a group, with the same scope and effect as the
indemnification of directors and officers provided for in
SYNNEX’ charter. The right to indemnification and the
advancement and payment of expenses that will be conferred by
SYNNEX’ charter and SYNNEX’ bylaws will not be exclusive
of any other right which any indemnified person may have or
acquire.

bylaws, in order for a matter to be deemed properly presented by a SYNNEX stockholder, timely notice must be delivered to, or
mailed and received by, SYNNEX not less than 50 nor more than 75 days prior to the next annual meeting; provided, however, that
