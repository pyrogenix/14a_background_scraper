LMI AEROSPACE, INC.

 
April 24, 2017
 
To the Shareholders of LMI Aerospace, Inc.:
 

You are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of shareholders, which we refer to as the “Special Meeting,” of LMI Aerospace,
Inc., a Missouri corporation, which we refer to as “LMI,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” to be held on June 8, 2017, at 10:00 a.m.,
Central time, at our principal executive offices at 411 Fountain Lakes Boulevard, St. Charles, Missouri 63301. A listen-only audio webcast of
the Special Meeting will also be accessible by visiting http://edge.media-server.com/m/p/rcgiosqd.

 
At the Special Meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adopt the Agreement and Plan of Merger, which we

refer to as the “Merger Agreement,” dated as of February 16, 2017, by and among LMI, Sonaca S.A., a limited liability company validly
existing under the laws of Belgium, which we refer to as “Sonaca” or “Parent,” Sonaca USA Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent, which we refer to as “Intermediate Co,” and Luminance Merger Sub, Inc., a Missouri corporation and indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, which we refer to as “Sub,” and approve the Merger (as defined below) and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Sub will merge with and into LMI, which we refer to
as the “Merger,” and LMI will be the surviving corporation in the Merger and will become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. At
the Special Meeting, you will also be asked to consider and vote on a non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain compensation that will
or may become payable to LMI’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 
If the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $14.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes,

for each share of common stock of LMI that you own (unless you have properly exercised and perfected your appraisal rights), which
represents a premium of approximately (i) 52% over LMI’s closing share price on February 16, 2017, the last trading day prior to the date the
Merger Agreement was publicly announced, (ii) 63% over LMI’s three-month volume weighted average price up to and including February 16,
2017, and (iii) 78% over LMI’s sixth-month volume weighted average price up to and including February 16, 2017.

 
The Board of Directors of LMI, which we refer to as the “Board of Directors,” other than Daniel G. Korte, a member of our

Board of Directors and the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, who abstained from voting due to his interests in the
transaction discussed in more detail in the enclosed proxy statement, after considering the factors more fully described in the enclosed
proxy statement, has unanimously (1) determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby are fair to and in the best interests of LMI and its shareholders; (2) approved and declared advisable the Merger
Agreement and the consummation by LMI of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby; (3) directed that the
Merger Agreement be submitted to the shareholders of LMI for adoption; and (4) resolved to recommend that LMI shareholders vote
in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement

 

 



9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. The Board of Directors, with Mr. Korte abstaining,
recommends that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby; (2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if
there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby
at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain compensation that will or may
become payable to LMI’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 
The enclosed proxy statement provides detailed information about the Special Meeting, the Merger Agreement and the Merger. A copy

of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to the proxy statement. The proxy statement also describes the actions and determinations of
the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger Agreement and the Merger. We encourage you to read the proxy
statement and its annexes, including the Merger Agreement, carefully and in their entirety, as they contain important information.

 
Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, please sign, date and return, as promptly as possible, the enclosed

proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy electronically over the internet or by telephone. If you attend the
Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke any proxy that you have previously submitted.

 
If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee how to vote your shares in

accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee. Without your instructions,
your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee cannot vote on a proposal for which it does not have discretionary authority.

 
Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares that you own. We cannot complete the Merger unless the

proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby is approved by the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of common stock of LMI as of April 21, 2017, the record
date for the Special Meeting. Please note that any abstention or other failure to vote your shares of common stock will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and to approve the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby.

 
If you have any questions or need assistance voting your shares, please contact our Proxy Solicitor:

Parties Involved in the Merger (Page 34)
 
LMI Aerospace, Inc.
 

LMI is a leading supplier of structural assemblies, kits and components, and design engineering services to the aerospace and defense
markets. LMI provides a broad array of manufacturing capabilities, as well as engineering and value-added services to the large commercial,
corporate and regional, and military aircraft markets. LMI also provides prototyping, testing and design capabilities to customers in support of
new product development and in-service aircraft. LMI is a preferred supplier to aircraft original equipment manufacturers and Tier 1
aerospace suppliers. In addition to aerospace products, LMI produces components and assemblies for laser equipment used by semiconductor
equipment manufacturers, electronic and electrical wire harnesses, cable assemblies, and mechanical sub-assemblies for the air and rail traffic
control, medical equipment, telecommunications, and heavy equipment industries.

 
Founded in 1948 as a manufacturer of components for the large commercial aircraft market of the aerospace industry, LMI became a

publicly-held company in 1998. Historically, its business was primarily dependent on the large commercial aircraft market, specifically with
one principal customer. In order to diversify its product and customer base, LMI implemented an acquisition and marketing strategy in the late
1990’s that has broadened the number of industries to which LMI sells its products and services and, within the aerospace industry, diversified
its customer base to reduce its dependence on any one principal customer.

The Merger and the Merger Consideration (Page 44)
 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Sub will merge with and into
LMI, and LMI will continue as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Parent, which we refer to as the
“surviving corporation.” Upon completion of the Merger, LMI will cease to be a publicly traded company and each outstanding share of LMI
common stock, par value $0.02 per share, that is

issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than (i) any shares held by LMI or its wholly-owned
subsidiaries as treasury shares or owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, Intermediate Co or Sub, which we refer to as “excluded shares,” and
(ii) any shares owned by shareholders who are entitled to and who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under The General
and Business Corporation Law of Missouri, which we refer to as the “MGBCL”), will be canceled, extinguished and automatically converted
into the right to receive $14.00 per share, in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes, which we refer to as the “Merger
Consideration.”

 
Following the completion of the Merger, you will no longer own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation. You

will, however, have the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but you will no longer have any other rights as a shareholder of LMI
(except that shareholders who have properly exercised and perfected their appraisal rights will have the right to receive a payment for the “fair
value” of their shares as determined pursuant to an appraisal proceeding as contemplated by the MGBCL, as described below in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Appraisal Rights”).

 
After the Merger is completed and if your shares of our common stock are held in book-entry form, the paying agent will issue and

deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your shares. If you are a shareholder of record with your shares held in certificate form, you will
receive a letter of transmittal with instructions on how to send your stock certificate(s) representing your shares of our common stock to the
paying agent following consummation of the Merger. The paying agent will issue and deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your shares
after you comply with these instructions. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. See the section in this proxy
statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures” for additional information.

 
If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your

broker, bank, trust or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of your shares held in “street name.”
 

Treatment of Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units (Page 87)
 

As a result of the Merger, the treatment of LMI’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the time at which the
Merger will become effective will be as follows:

 
Restricted Shares
 

Each share of restricted common stock of LMI granted under LMI’s equity incentive plans or otherwise (each such share, a
“Restricted Share”) that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be fully vested and, at the effective time of
the Merger, canceled and extinguished and converted into the Merger Consideration.

 
Restricted Stock Units
 

Each restricted stock unit awarded pursuant to LMI’s equity incentive plans (each, an “RSU”) that is outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time of the Merger will be fully

vested and settled in one share of common stock of LMI and, at the effective time of the Merger, canceled and extinguished and converted
into the Merger Consideration.

● the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Merger Agreement with respect to the absence of a Company

● the other representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the Merger Agreement were true and correct as of the date of the

representation and warranty expressly relates to a specific date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be so true and

in which case such representation and warranty shall be so true and correct as of such date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent material adverse
effect (as defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Material Adverse Effect Definition”);

 
● each of Parent, Intermediate Co and Sub will have performed or complied in all material respects with all obligations required to be

performed or complied with by it under the Merger Agreement at or prior to the closing date of the Merger; and
 

● the Company will have received a certificate executed by an executive officer of Parent confirming that the above conditions to the
Company’s obligation to complete the Merger have been satisfied.

 
Financing of the Merger (Page 85)
 

Although obtaining the proceeds of any financing, including financing under the commitment letters described in this section, is not a
condition to the completion of the Merger, the failure of Parent or Sub to obtain any portion of certain committed financing described below
(or alternative financing) is likely to result in the failure of the Merger to be completed.

 
Parent has obtained equity financing commitments from SFPI-FPIM in an amount up to €15 million, and from Wespavia SA in an

amount up to €85 million. Parent has also obtained debt financing commitments from ING Bank N.V., BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV and ING
Belgium SA/NV in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement consisting of (i) a euro denominated term loan
facility in the aggregate principal amount of €50

million, (ii) a U.S. dollar denominated term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $270 million, and (iii) a euro (and certain other
currencies) denominated revolving credit facility in the aggregate amount of up to €60 million.

 
We believe that the amounts committed under the commitment letters will be sufficient to complete the Merger, but we cannot assure

you of that. Those amounts might be insufficient if, among other things, one or more of the parties to the commitment letters fails to fund the
financing or if the conditions to such commitments are not met, which conditions include the failure to receive the proceeds of the equity
financing, as described further in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Financing of the Merger.”

 
Governmental and Regulatory Approvals (Page 100)
 

Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed until notifications have been
given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (“Antitrust Division”) and the Federal
Trade Commission (“FTC”) and all statutory waiting period requirements have expired or been terminated. On March 10, 2017, both the
Company and Parent filed their respective Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC, and each requested early
termination of the 30-day statutory waiting period. The Antitrust Division and the FTC granted the requests by the Company and Parent for
early termination of the waiting period, effective April 11, 2017 at 2:13 p.m. Eastern time and 2:12 p.m. Eastern time, respectively.

 
The Merger is also conditioned on the issuance by CFIUS of a written notification to the parties to the Merger Agreement that it has

concluded a review of the notification voluntarily provided pursuant to the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (the “DPA”), and
determined not to conduct a full investigation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or, if a full investigation is deemed
to be required, notification that the U.S. government will not take action to prevent the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
from being consummated.

 
On March 17, 2017, LMI and Parent submitted a draft joint notice with CFIUS. On April 3, 2017, LMI and Parent submitted the final

joint voluntary notice with CFIUS. On April 10, 2017, CFIUS accepted the parties’ joint notice and began its initial 30-day review period.
 
The Merger also cannot be completed unless and until (i) 60 days have passed since LMI notified the DDTC of the Merger and the

DDTC has not taken or threatened to take enforcement action against Parent in connection with the consummation of the Merger or (ii) the
DDTC has notified LMI or Parent that it does not intend to take enforcement action against Parent in connection with the consummation of
the Merger.

 
On April 21, 2017, LMI submitted notification of the Merger to the staff of the DDTC.

Merger,” LMI’s Board of Directors, which we refer to as the “Board of Directors,” other than Daniel G. Korte, a member of the Board of
Directors and the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, who abstained from voting due to his interests in the transaction as
described in the section of the proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of LMI’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,”
unanimously (1) determined that the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby are fair to
and in the best interests of LMI and its shareholders; (2) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement and consummation by LMI
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby; (3) directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the shareholders of
LMI for adoption and (4) resolved to recommend that LMI shareholders vote in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approve
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. The Board of Directors, with Mr. Korte abstaining, unanimously recommends
that you vote (1) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby;
(2) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to
adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting; and
(3) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to LMI’s named
executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 
Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC (Page 69)
 

In connection with the Merger, on February 16, 2017, the Company’s financial advisor, Lazard, rendered its oral opinion to our
Board of Directors, subsequently confirmed in writing, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, procedures,
factors, qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the per share merger consideration to be paid to holders of Company common stock
(other than (i) excluded shares and (ii) shares of Company common stock held by holders who are entitled to and properly demand an
appraisal of their shares (such holders, “excluded holders”)), in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of
Company common stock (other than excluded holders).

 
The full text of Lazard’s written opinion, dated February 16, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures followed,

factors considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Lazard in connection with its opinion is attached to this
proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to read Lazard’s opinion, and the
section “The Merger—Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC” carefully and in their entirety. Lazard’s opinion was directed to our Board of
Directors for the information and assistance of our Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the Merger and only
addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company common stock (other than excluded holders) of the
per share merger consideration to be paid to such holders in the Merger as of the date of Lazard’s opinion. Lazard’s opinion did not
address any other aspect of the Merger and was not intended to and does not constitute a recommendation to any holder of Company
common stock as to how such holder should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any matter relating thereto. Lazard expressed
no view or opinion as to any terms or other aspects (other than the per share Merger Consideration to the extent expressly specified in
the opinion) of the Merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger

or any agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with, or contemplated by, the Merger. In addition, Lazard expressed
no view or opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the compensation to any officers,
directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative to the per share Merger Consideration or
otherwise.

 
Interests of LMI’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger (Page 87)
 

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger
Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, you should be aware that our directors and executive
officers may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of shareholders generally, as more fully
described below. In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii)
recommending that the Merger Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby be adopted and approved by
shareholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other
matters. These interests include the following:

 
● the entitlement of each executive officer and director of the Company to the treatment of Restricted Shares and RSUs described

above under “—Treatment of Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units.”
 

● the entitlement of each executive officer pursuant to his or her current or new employment agreement to receive payments and
benefits in connection with an involuntary termination of service within a period of time immediately following the effective time of
the Merger, which may include:

 
○ continued base salary for 2.5 years and a pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination; and

 
○ continued health benefits at a reduced premium.

 
● continued indemnification and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.

 
If the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and to approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby is

approved, the shares of our common stock held by our directors and executive officers will be treated in the same manner as outstanding
shares of our common stock held by all other shareholders. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger—Interests of LMI’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

 
Appraisal Rights (Page 93)
 

Under Section 351.455 of MGBCL, holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on April 21, 2017, which we
refer to as the “Record Date,” as registered in the records of the Company, who object to the Merger Agreement will be entitled to seek
appraisal for, and obtain payment in cash for the judicially determined fair value of, their shares of

9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

common stock in lieu of receiving the Merger Consideration if the Merger is completed, but only if they comply with all applicable
requirements of the MGBCL. This value could be more than, the same as, or less than the Merger Consideration. Any holder of common stock
as registered in the records of the Company, as of the Record Date, intending to exercise appraisal rights, among other things, must (i) file
with the Company a written objection to the Merger prior to or at the Special Meeting, (ii) not vote in favor of the proposal to approve the
Merger Agreement, (iii) make a written demand on the Company within 20 days after the effective time of the Merger for payment of the fair
value of his, her or its shares as of the day before the date on which the vote was taken approving the Merger Agreement and (iv) otherwise
strictly comply with all of the procedures required by Missouri law. Section 351.455 of the MGBCL is included as Annex C to this proxy
statement. You are encouraged to read these provisions carefully and in their entirety. Moreover, due to the complexity of the procedures for
exercising the right to seek appraisal, shareholders who are considering exercising such rights are encouraged to seek the advice of legal
counsel. Failure to strictly comply with these provisions may result in the waiver of, or inability to exercise, the right of appraisal.
Shareholders who vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement will waive their appraisal rights, unless they revoke their
proxies, if revocable, prior to the Special Meeting (as defined in the section of this proxy statement below captioned “—The Special Meeting
of LMI Shareholders – Date, Time, and Place”) and otherwise comply with Section 351.455 of the MGBCL.

 
Go-Shop; Acquisition Proposals; Change in Recommendation (Page 113)
 
Go-Shop; Acquisition Proposals
 

From February 16, 2017 and continuing until 11:59 p.m. (New York time) on March 18, 2017 (which we refer to as the “go-
shop period end date”), the Company and its subsidiaries and their respective representatives were permitted to:

 
● solicit (whether publicly or otherwise) any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes an acquisition proposal (as

defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Go-Shop; Acquisition Proposals; Change of
Recommendation—Go-Shop; Acquisition Proposals”), including by providing information (including non-public information and
data) regarding the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, and

 
● participate in any discussions or negotiations with respect to any acquisition proposals and cooperate with or assist with any such

discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any acquisition proposals, including by providing information
(including non-public information and data) regarding the Company and its subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement.

 
The Company was required to notify Parent in writing of the identity of any qualified purchaser (as such term is defined in the

section of the proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Go-Shop; Acquisition Proposals; Change of Recommendation—Go-Shop;
Acquisition Proposals”) no later than March 23, 2017 (four business days after the go-shop period end date). The Company did not receive
any alternative acquisition proposals as of the go-shop period end date and, accordingly, there were no qualified purchasers.

After the go-shop period, and subject to certain exceptions described below, the Company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from,

directly or indirectly:
 

● initiating, soliciting, knowingly encouraging or facilitating (including by way of providing information) the submission or making of
any requests, inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any acquisition proposal or
engaging in, entering into, continuing or otherwise participating in, any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto, or otherwise
cooperating with or assisting or participating in, or facilitating any such requests, proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations, or
furnishing to any person or entity any nonpublic information in furtherance of or afford access to the books and records or the
directors, officers, employees or other representatives of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to any person with respect to, any
proposal or offer that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in any acquisition proposal;

 
● except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement’s customary fiduciary out exceptions, approving, endorsing or

recommending, or publicly proposing to approve, endorse or recommend, an acquisition proposal, or entering into any confidentiality
agreement, merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, purchase agreement, option agreement, or other agreement
providing for or relating to an acquisition proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement as set forth below) or entering into any
agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or breach its obligations thereunder or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing;

 
● taking any action to make the provisions of any takeover law inapplicable to any transaction contemplated by an acquisition

proposal;
 

● terminating, amending, releasing, modifying or failing to enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or request under,
any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by the Company in respect of or in contemplation of an acquisition
proposal; or

 
● publicly proposing to do any of the foregoing.

 
After the go-shop period end date, the Company and its subsidiaries were obligated to cease and terminate any solicitation,

negotiation or cooperation with any inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations with any persons or entities conducted prior to the date of
the Merger Agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal.

 
Notwithstanding the restrictions above, if after the go-shop period end date and prior to the date and time on which Shareholder

Approval is obtained, (i) the Company receives an unsolicited written acquisition proposal from a third party that our Board of Directors
determines in good faith to be bona fide, (ii) such acquisition proposal did not result in any material respect from a breach of the covenant not
to solicit such proposals under the Merger Agreement, (iii) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or would be reasonably expected to

result in a superior proposal and that the failure to take the action described immediately below with respect to the third party making such an
acquisition proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then the Company may:

 
● enter into a confidentiality agreement (on terms no more favorable to the other party than those in the confidentiality agreement

previously entered into between Parent and the Company) with the person or entity making such acquisition proposal and furnish
information with respect to the Company and our subsidiaries to that person or entity; and

 
● participate in discussions or negotiations with the person or entity making such acquisition proposal.

 
Following the go-shop period end date, the Company is required to promptly notify Parent if it takes any action described in the

previous paragraph and provide a copy of any related acquisition proposal, must keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis of any
material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any acquisition proposals and, upon the reasonable request of Parent, must
apprise Parent of the status of those discussions or negotiations.

 
Change of Recommendation
 

Until the earlier of the effective time of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement, neither the Board of Directors nor
any committee thereof is permitted to effect a Change of Recommendation (as such term is defined in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger Agreement—Go-Shop; Acquisition Proposals; Change of Recommendation—Change of Recommendation”).

 
Notwithstanding these restrictions, at any time prior to the time the Shareholder Approval has been obtained, if the Board of

Directors determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties,
the Board of Directors may:

 
● change its recommendation as a result of an event, development or change in circumstances that first occurred or became known

after the date of the Merger Agreement, other than with respect to a superior proposal; or
 

● change its recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive alternative acquisition agreement, with
respect to a superior proposal.

 
The Board of Directors may not change its recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement in the two circumstances described in

the paragraph above unless the superior proposal did not result in any material respect from a breach by the Company of its obligations not to
solicit proposals (in the case of a superior proposal) and:

 
● the Company has provided four business days’ prior written notice to the Parent, Intermediate Co and Sub of its intention to make a

Change of Recommendation or, in connection with a superior proposal, terminate the Merger Agreement; and
 

12 



9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

● prior to changing its recommendation or terminating the Merger Agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior

proposal, (i) the Company has negotiated with the Parent in good faith to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement, and (ii) the Board of Directors has determined in good faith that the superior proposal still constitutes a superior
proposal or it would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties to the holders of
Company common stock under applicable law to not effect a Change of Recommendation.

 
In the event of any material revision to the terms of any superior proposal or acquisition proposal that the Board of Directors determines

no longer constitutes a superior proposal, including any change in the price terms, the Company must deliver a new written notice to the
Parent, Intermediate Co and Sub within two business days.

 
Termination of the Merger Agreement (Page 127)
 

The Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time of the Merger, whether before or after receipt of the
Shareholder Approval:

 
● by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 
● by either the Company or Parent:

 
○ if the Merger has not been consummated on or before August 16, 2017 (which we refer to as the “Outside Date”), provided

that either the Company or the Parent may extend the Outside Date until September 29, 2017 if the reason the Merger has
not been consummated by the Outside Date is due to the fact that certain regulatory approvals or the Shareholder Approval
have not yet been obtained; however, such right of termination is not available to any party if the failure of such party to
perform any of its obligations under the Merger Agreement has been a primary cause of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated on or before such date;

 
○ if any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, law or other governmental order issued by any

court of competent jurisdiction enjoining or otherwise preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger is in effect
and is final and nonappealable, provided, however, that such right of termination is not available to any party unless such
party has complied with its obligations under the Merger Agreement to prevent, oppose or remove such restraint;

 
○ if the Shareholder Approval has not been obtained at the shareholders’ meeting duly convened or at any adjournment or

postponement thereof; or
 

○ if there is any breach or inaccuracy in any of the other party’s representations or warranties set forth in the Merger
Agreement or the other party has failed to perform any of its covenants under the Merger Agreement, which inaccuracy,
breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to, if occurring or continuing at the

 effective time of the Merger, the failure of any of the terminating party’s conditions to closing and (ii) has not been or is not

capable of being cured by such other party prior to the earlier of (a) August 16, 2017 and (b) the 30th calendar day after
such other party’s receipt of written notice thereof from the terminating party; provided that neither party has such right of
termination if it is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants, or other agreements under the Merger
Agreement which breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions to closing applicable to
the other party (we refer to such termination by the Parent as a “Company Breach Termination”);

 
● by Parent, if the Shareholder Approval has not been obtained and (each of which we refer to as a “Change in Recommendation

Termination”):
 

○ if the Board of Directors or any committee thereof effects a Change of Recommendation (as defined in the section of this
proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Change of Recommendation”);

 
○ if the Company failed to include in this proxy statement, when mailed, the Board of Directors’ recommendation that our

shareholders adopt the Merger Agreement and a statement of the findings and conclusions of the Board of Directors;
 

○ if, following the public disclosure or announcement of an acquisition proposal (other than a tender or exchange offer
described below), the Board of Directors has failed to reaffirm publicly its recommendation that our shareholders adopt the
Merger Agreement within ten business days after Parent requests in writing that such recommendation under such
circumstances be reaffirmed publicly; or

 
○ if a tender or exchange offer relating to securities of the Company has been commenced and the Company has not

announced, within ten business days after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, a statement disclosing that
the Company recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer.

 
● by the Company:

 
○ in order to accept a superior proposal (in compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement) and enter into an alternative

acquisition agreement with respect to such superior proposal, provided, that the Company pays the break-up fee prior to or
contemporaneously with such termination (which we refer to as a “Alternative Acquisition Termination”); or

 
○ if (i) all of Parent’s, Intermediate Co’s and Sub’s conditions to their obligation to close the transactions contemplated by the

Merger Agreement have been satisfied (other than those that require deliveries or are tested at the time of closing of the
Merger, which conditions would have been satisfied if the closing had occurred at the time of such termination), (ii) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed by written notice to Parent that (x) all of the Company’s obligations to effect the
Merger have been satisfied or have been irrevocably waived in writing and (y) the

9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 26/255

 

 
Company is prepared to consummate the Merger at the closing, and (iii) Parent, Intermediate Co and Sub fail to
consummate the Merger within two business days following delivery of such notice.

 
Break-Up Fees (Page 129)
 

The Company will pay to or cause to be paid to or as directed by Parent a “break-up fee” (if a break-up fee has not already been paid
pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement) in the event that:

 
● a Change in Recommendation Termination or Alternative Acquisition Termination occurs or

 
● a Company Breach Termination occurs or the Merger Agreement is terminated because the Merger has not been consummated by the

Outside Date at a time when a Company Breach Termination was available and, in either case, within twelve months following such
termination, the Company either (i) consummates an acquisition transaction that results in a change of control or (ii) enters into a
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other contract with respect to an acquisition transaction that results in a change of
control that is ultimately consummated (whether or not such consummation occurs within twelve months following such
termination).

 
The amount of the break-up fee would have been $10.0 million upon certain termination events associated with a superior proposal

arising from the go-shop period, none of which occurred. The amount of the break-up fee is $15 million under any other circumstance in
which a break-up fee is payable.

 
Fees Payable by LMI (Page 129)
 

The Company is responsible for paying the filing, printing and mailing fees and expenses associated with this proxy statement.
 
The Parent is required to reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable

attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with their cooperation with Parent’s arrangement of the debt
financing or alternative financing, and for all documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by
the Company in connection with its cooperation pursuant to (i) an offer to purchase and/or consent solicitation with respect to, or a redemption
of, the existing notes and (ii) a redemption of the IRBs (as such terms are defined in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger Agreement—Financing”).

 
The Parent is also responsible for 100% of the filing fees payable to the FTC, the Antitrust Division, CFIUS, or any other

governmental entity in connection with the antitrust, competition, or trade regulation matters contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
 
All other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the transactions contemplated

thereby will be paid by the party incurring or required to incur such fees or expenses, except as otherwise provided in this proxy statement.

The Special Meeting of LMI Shareholders (Page 36)
 

Date, Time and Place
 
A special meeting of shareholders of LMI, which we refer to as the “Special Meeting,” will be held on June 8, 2017, at 10:00 a.m.,

Central time, at our principal executive offices at 411 Fountain Lakes Boulevard, St. Charles, Missouri 63301.
 
Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote
 
You are entitled to vote at the Special Meeting if you owned shares of our common stock at the close of business on April 21, 2017,

the Record Date. You will have one vote at the Special Meeting for each share of our common stock that you owned at the close of business
on the Record Date.

 
Purpose
 
At the Special Meeting, we will ask shareholders to vote on proposals to: (i) adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger

and the other transactions thereby, (ii) adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient
votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special
Meeting, and (iii) approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to LMI’s named executive
officers in connection with the Merger.

 
Quorum
 
As of the Record Date, there were 13,694,093 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting.

The shareholders of LMI representing a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding common stock of LMI, present in person
or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at the Special Meeting.

 
Required Vote
 
The MGBCL requires that at least two-thirds of the shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting

at the close of business on the Record Date vote in favor of the Merger Agreement in order for the Merger to be consummated. The failure of
any shareholder to vote, abstentions, and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote by that shareholder “AGAINST” the Merger,
the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Approval of each of the adjournment proposal and the advisory non-binding
proposal on executive compensation payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock present in person or represented by
proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” these proposals but the
failure to vote your shares and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals.

 
Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote.

9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

Share Ownership of Our Directors and Executive Officers
 
At the close of business on the Record Date, directors and executive officers of the Company and their subsidiaries were entitled to

vote 2,166,327 shares of common stock, or approximately 15.9% of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding on that date.
 
Voting and Proxies
 
Any shareholder of record entitled to vote at the Special Meeting may submit a proxy by returning a signed proxy card by mail in the

accompanying prepaid reply envelope or granting a proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone, or may vote in person by appearing
at the Special Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares of our common stock in “street name” through a broker, bank,
trustee or other nominee, you should instruct your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares of our common
stock using the instructions provided by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee. Under applicable stock exchange rules, brokers, banks,
trustees and other nominees have the discretion to vote on routine matters. The proposals to be considered at the Special Meeting include non-
routine matters, and brokers, banks, trustees and other nominees cannot vote on these proposals without your instructions. As a result, absent
specific instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares, brokers are not empowered to vote those shares, referred to generally as
“broker non-votes.” Broker non-votes will be treated as shares that are present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining whether a
quorum exists and will have the same effect as votes “AGAINST” the proposal regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, but will have no effect on the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, whether or
not a quorum is present, or on the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable
to LMI’s executive officers in connection with the Merger. Therefore, it is important that you cast your vote or instruct your broker,
bank, trustee or other nominee on how you wish to vote your shares.

 
If you are a shareholder of record on the Record Date, you may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted

at the Special Meeting by: (i) signing another proxy card with a later date and returning it to us prior to the Special Meeting; (ii) submitting a
new proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone after the date of the earlier submitted proxy; (iii) delivering a written notice of
revocation to our Corporate Secretary; or (iv) attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

 
If you hold your shares of our common stock in “street name,” you should contact your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee for

instructions regarding how to change your vote. You may also vote in person at the Special Meeting if you obtain a “legal proxy” from your
broker, bank, trustee or other nominee.

 
All shares represented by properly executed proxies received in time for the Special Meeting will be voted at the Special Meeting in

the manner specified by the holders. Properly executed proxies that do not contain voting instructions will be voted “FOR” the proposal
regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, “FOR” the
proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 29/255

 

 
necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting, and “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding,
advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to LMI’s executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 
Shares of our common stock represented at the Special Meeting but not voted, including shares of our common stock for which

proxies have been received but for which shareholders have abstained, will be treated as present at the Special Meeting for purposes of
determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of all business.

 
Only shares affirmatively voted for the proposal regarding adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the

other transactions contemplated thereby, including properly executed proxies that do not contain specific voting instructions, will be counted
“FOR” that proposal.

 
If you abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal regarding adoption of the Merger

Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, “AGAINST” the proposal to adjourn the Special
Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, and “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation
that will or may become payable to LMI’s executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 
If you do not execute a proxy card, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal regarding adoption of the Merger

Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, but will have no effect on the proposal to adjourn the
Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, or on the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that
will or may become payable to LMI’s executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 
Effect on LMI if the Merger is Not Completed (Page 44)
 

If the Merger Agreement is not adopted and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are not
approved by the required vote of LMI shareholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, LMI shareholders will not receive
any payment for their shares of our common stock. Instead, LMI will remain an independent public company, our common stock will continue
to be listed and traded on NASDAQ and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which we refer to as the
“Exchange Act,” and we will continue to file periodic and current reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as
the “SEC.” If the Merger is not completed, depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, the price of our
common stock may decline significantly, and if that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock would return to
the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement. Under specified circumstances, LMI will be required to pay Sonaca a break-
up fee upon the termination of the Merger Agreement. For more details, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—
Effect on LMI if the Merger is Not Completed.”

Accounting Treatment (Page 96)
 

It is currently the intent to have the Merger accounted for as a “purchase transaction” for Belgian financial accounting purposes.
 

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger (Page 96)
 

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the receipt of cash by a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this proxy statement
captioned “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger”) in exchange for such U.S. Holder’s shares of our
common stock in the Merger generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss in an amount measured by the difference, if any, between
the amount of cash that such U.S. Holder receives in the Merger (computed as if there were no applicable withholding taxes) and such U.S.
Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares of our common stock surrendered in the Merger. Gain or loss realized generally must be calculated
separately for each block of shares (i.e., shares acquired at the same cost in a single transaction) surrendered pursuant to the Merger.

 
A Non-U.S. Holder (as defined in this proxy statement in the section captioned “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax

Consequences of the Merger”) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to the exchange of shares of our common
stock for cash in the Merger, unless such Non-U.S. Holder has certain connections to the United States.

 
The determination of actual tax consequences of the Merger to a holder of our common stock will depend on the holder’s specific

situation. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger — Material U.S. Federal Income Tax
Consequences of the Merger.” Shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences
relating to the Merger in light of their particular circumstances and any consequences arising under U.S. federal non-income tax laws or the
laws of any state, local or foreign taxing jurisdiction.

 
When the Merger is Expected to be Completed (Page 104)
 

As of the date of this proxy statement, the Merger is expected to be completed by the second half of 2017. However, there can be no
assurances that the Merger will be completed at all or, if completed, that it will be completed by the second half of 2017.

 
Delisting and Deregistration of LMI Common Stock (Page 93)
 

When the Merger is completed, the LMI common stock currently listed on the NASDAQ will cease to be quoted on the NASDAQ
and will be deregistered under the Exchange Act.

 
Litigation Related to the Merger (Page 101)
 

On March 24, 2017, a shareholder class action complaint was filed in connection with our entry into the Merger Agreement in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against the Company, the Board of Directors, Parent, Intermediate Co, and
Sub: The Vladimir Gusinsky Rev. Trust v. LMI Aerospace, Inc., et. Al., Case No. 4:17-cv-01090-SPM. On

March 27, 2017, a second shareholder class action complaint was filed in connection with our entry into the Merger Agreement in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against the Company and the Board of Directors: Madjid Benchabane v. LMI
Aerospace, Inc., et. al., Case No. 4:17-cv-01100. The complaints bring claims under Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act
pertaining to the purported dissemination of allegedly misleading proxy materials. The first complaint seeks, among other things, declaration
that the action is properly maintainable as a class action; an order enjoining the defendants from consummating the Merger; in the event the
Merger is consummated, an order rescinding it and setting it aside or awarding rescissory damages; dissemination of a proxy statement that
does not contain the allegedly misleading information; and unspecified attorneys’ fees and costs. The second complaint seeks, among other
things, declaration that the action is properly maintainable as a class action; an order enjoining the defendants from consummating the Merger
unless allegedly omitted information is disclosed in the proxy; and unspecified damages, attorneys’ fees and costs.

 
Additional Information (Page 139)
 

You can find more information about the Company in the periodic reports and other information we file with the SEC. The
information is available on the SEC’s public reference facilities and at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov. For a more
detailed description of the additional information available, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

 
The following questions and answers address some commonly asked questions regarding the Merger, the Merger Agreement and the

Special Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that are important to you. We encourage you to read carefully the
more detailed information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement, the annexes to this proxy statement and the documents we refer to in
this proxy statement. You may obtain the information incorporated by reference in this proxy statement without charge by following the
instructions in the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where You Can Find More Information.”

 
Q: Why am I receiving this proxy statement?
 
A: On February 16, 2017, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement providing for the Merger of Sub, an indirect, wholly-owned

subsidiary of Parent, with and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent. You are receiving this proxy statement and form of proxy card in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of
Directors in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and the other matters to be voted on at the Special Meeting.

 
Q: What is the proposed transaction?
 
A: The proposed transaction is the merger of Sub with and into the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Following the effective

time of the Merger, the Company would be privately held as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.
 
Q: What will I receive in the Merger?
 
A: If the Merger is completed, you will be entitled to receive $14.00 in cash, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes,

for each share of our common stock that you own. For example, if you own 100 shares of common stock of the Company, you will be
entitled to receive $1,400 in cash in exchange for your shares of common stock, without interest and less any applicable withholding
taxes. You will not be entitled to receive shares in the surviving corporation or in Parent.

 
Q: What will the holders of LMI restricted shares and restricted stock units receive in the Merger?
 
A: Each Restricted Share and each RSU granted under LMI’s equity incentive plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective

time of the Merger shall be fully vested and, at the effective time of the Merger, canceled and extinguished, and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the $14.00 per share Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes.

Q: How does the Merger Consideration compare to the market price of the common stock?
 
A: The relationship of the Merger Consideration to the trading price of our common stock constituted a premium of approximately (i)

52% over LMI’s closing share price on February 16, 2017, the last trading day prior to the date when the Merger Agreement was
publicly announced, (ii) 63% over LMI’s three-month volume weighted average price up to and including February 16, 2017, and (iii)
78% over LMI’s six-month volume weighted average price up to and including February 16, 2017.

 
Q: Where and when is the Special Meeting?
 
A: The Special Meeting will take place on June 8, 2017, at 10:00 a.m., Central time, at our principal executive offices at 411 Fountain

Lakes Boulevard, St. Charles, Missouri 63301.
 
Q: Who is entitled to vote at the Special Meeting?
  
A: Shareholders as of the Record Date are entitled to notice of the Special Meeting and to vote at the Special Meeting. Each holder of

shares of our common stock is entitled to cast one vote on each matter properly brought before the Special Meeting for each share of
our common stock owned as of the Record Date.

 
Q: May I attend the Special Meeting and vote in person?
 
A: Yes. All shareholders as of the Record Date may attend the Special Meeting and vote in person. Seating will be limited. Shareholders

will need to present proof of ownership of shares of our common stock, such as a bank or brokerage account statement, and a form of
personal identification to be admitted to the Special Meeting. No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, large bags,
briefcases or packages will be permitted in the Special Meeting, except as administered by the Company.

 
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, to ensure that your shares will be represented at the Special Meeting we
encourage you to sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope or grant your proxy
electronically over the Internet or by telephone. If you attend the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your vote will revoke
any proxy previously submitted by you with respect to the shares so voted in person.
 
If you hold your shares in “street name,” you should instruct your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee how to vote your shares in
accordance with the voting instruction form that you will receive from your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee. Without your
instructions, your broker or other agent cannot vote on a proposal for which it does not have discretionary authority. If you hold your
shares in “street name,” you may not vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your
broker, bank, trustee or other nominee.
 

Q: What matters will be voted on at the Special Meeting?

A: You will be asked to consider and vote on the following proposals:
 

● to approve the Merger Agreement;
 

● to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to solicit additional proxies, if necessary or appropriate, if there are insufficient
votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement;

 
● to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, specified compensation that may be payable to the named executive officers of the

Company in connection with the Merger; and
 

● to act upon other business that may properly come before the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof by or
at the direction of the Board of Directors.

 
Q: What vote of our shareholders is required to approve the Merger Agreement?
  
A: Under the MGBCL, shareholders holding at least two-thirds of the shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the

Special Meeting at the close of business on the Record Date must affirmatively vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the Merger
Agreement. In addition, under the Merger Agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition to the consummation of the
Merger. A failure to vote your shares of common stock, an abstention from voting or a broker non-vote will have the same effect as a
vote against the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement.

  
As of the Record Date, there were 13,694,093 shares of common stock outstanding.
 

Q: What vote is required to approve any proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional
proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting and to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation
that will or may become payable to LMI’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger?

 
A: Approval of the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are

insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby at the time
of the Special Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding common
stock of the Company present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.

 
Approval, by non-binding, advisory vote, of certain compensation that will or may become payable to LMI’s named executive officers
in connection with the Merger also requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock present
in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 35/255

 

  
The failure of any shareholder of record to (i) submit a signed proxy card; (ii) grant a proxy over the Internet or by telephone; or (iii)
vote in person by ballot at the Special Meeting will not have any effect on either the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, or the
proposal to approve certain compensation that will or may become payable to LMI’s named executive officers in connection with the
Merger. If you hold your shares in “street name,” the failure to instruct your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee how to vote your
shares will not have any effect on either of these proposals. However, abstentions will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST”
these proposals.
 

Q: How many votes am I entitled to cast for each share of Company common stock that I own?
 
A: Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote.
 
Q: What is a quorum?
 
A: A quorum will be present if holders of a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the Record Date

are present in person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting. If a quorum is not present at the Special Meeting, the Special
Meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time until a quorum is obtained.

 
If you submit a proxy but abstain or fail to provide voting instructions on any of the proposals listed on the proxy card, your shares
will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting.
 
If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee and you do not tell the nominee how to vote
your shares, these shares will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business at the
Special Meeting.
 

Q: How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?
 
A: The Board of Directors, other than Daniel G. Korte, a member of the Board of Directors and the Company’s President and Chief

Executive Officer, who abstained from voting due to his interests in the transaction as described in the section of the proxy statement
captioned “The Merger—Interests of LMI’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” unanimously recommends that our
shareholders vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger. The Board of Directors, with Mr. Korte
abstaining, also unanimously recommends that the shareholders of the Company vote “FOR” the advisory (non-binding) proposal to
approve specified compensation that may become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the
Merger and “FOR” the proposal regarding adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate.

 
Q: Why is the Board of Directors recommending that I vote “FOR” the Merger?

9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 36/255

 

  
A: After careful consideration, the Board of Directors, other than Daniel G. Korte, a member of the Board of Directors and the

Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, who abstained from voting due to his interests in the transaction as described in the
section of the proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of LMI’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,”
unanimously determined that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders. After such consideration, the Board of Directors, with Mr. Korte abstaining, approved
and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement in
accordance with the requirements of the MGBCL. In reaching its decision to approve the Merger Agreement and to recommend
approval of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, the proposal regarding adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or
appropriate by our shareholders, and the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve specified compensation that may become payable
to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the Merger, the Board of Directors consulted with our
management, as well as our legal and financial advisors, and considered the terms of the proposed Merger Agreement. The Board of
Directors also considered each of the items set forth under the section of this proxy captioned “The Merger—Recommendation of the
Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger.”

 
Q: What effects will the Merger have on LMI?
 
A: Our common stock is currently registered under the Exchange Act and is quoted on the NASDAQ, under the symbol “LMIA.” As a

result of the Merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company and will be indirectly wholly-owned by Parent.
Following the consummation of the Merger, the registration of our common stock and our reporting obligations under the Exchange
Act will be terminated. In addition, upon the consummation of the Merger, our common stock will no longer be listed on any stock
exchange or quotation system, including the NASDAQ.

 
Q: What happens if the Merger is not consummated?
 
A: If the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are not approved by the

Company’s shareholders, or if the Merger is not consummated for any other reason, the Company’s shareholders will not receive any
payment for their shares of common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, the Company will remain an independent public
company and shares of our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NASDAQ. Furthermore, depending on the
circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, the price of our common stock may decline significantly, and if that were to
occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock would return to the price at which it trades as of the date of this
proxy statement. Under specified circumstances, the Company may be required to pay to Parent a break-up fee of $15 million (and any
costs of collection). See “The Merger Agreement—Break-Up Fees” and “The Merger Agreement—Fees Payable by LMI.”

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 37/255

 

  
Q: What will happen if shareholders do not approve the advisory proposal on executive compensation payable to the Company’s

named executive officers in connection with the Merger?
 
A: The approval of this proposal is not a condition to the completion of the Merger. The vote on this proposal is an advisory vote and will

not be binding on the Company or Parent. If the Merger Agreement is approved by the shareholders and the Merger is completed, the
Merger-related compensation may be paid to the Company’s named executive officers even if shareholders fail to approve this
proposal.

 
Q: What do I need to do now? How do I vote my shares of common stock?
 
A: We urge you to read this proxy statement carefully, including its annexes and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in

this proxy statement, and to consider how the Merger affects you. Your vote is important. If you are a shareholder of record (that is, if
your shares of our common stock are registered in your name with Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., our transfer agent),
there are four ways to vote:

 
● by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the accompanying prepaid reply envelope;

 
● by visiting the Internet at the address on your proxy card;

 
● by calling toll-free (within the U.S. or Canada) the phone number on your proxy card; or

 
● by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person by ballot.

 
A control number, located on your proxy card, is designed to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares of our common
stock, and to confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded when voting electronically over the Internet or by
telephone. Please be aware that, although there is no charge for voting your shares, if you vote electronically over the Internet or by
telephone, you may incur costs such as internet access and telephone charges for which you will be responsible.
 
Even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares of our common stock by
proxy. If you are a record holder or if you obtain a “legal proxy” to vote shares that you beneficially own, you may still vote your
shares of our common stock in person by ballot at the Special Meeting even if you have previously voted by proxy. If you are present
at the Special Meeting and vote in person by ballot, your previous vote by proxy will not be counted.
 
If your shares are held in “street name” through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you may vote through your broker, bank,
trustee or other nominee by completing and returning the voting form provided by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, or, if
such a service is provided by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, electronically over the Internet or by telephone. To vote over
the Internet or by telephone through your

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 38/255

 

  
broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you should follow the instructions on the voting form provided by your bank, broker or
nominee.
 

Q: What happens if I do not vote?
 
A: The vote to approve the Merger Agreement is based on the total number of shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at

the Special Meeting on the Record Date, not just the shares that are voted. If you do not vote, it will have the same effect as a vote
“AGAINST” the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement.

 
Q: Should I send in my stock certificates or other evidence of ownership now?
 
A: No. If you hold your shares in your name as a shareholder of record, then shortly after the Merger is completed, you will receive a

letter of transmittal from the paying agent for the Merger with detailed written instructions for exchanging your shares of common
stock for the Merger Consideration. If your shares of common stock are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, trustee or other
nominee, you may receive instructions from your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee as to what action, if any, you need to take to
effect the surrender of your “street name” shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Do not send in your certificates now.

 
Q: I do not know where my stock certificate is—how will I get the Merger Consideration for my shares?
 
A: If the Merger is completed, the transmittal materials you will receive after the completion of the Merger will include the procedures

that you must follow if you cannot locate your stock certificate. This will include an affidavit that you will need to sign attesting to the
loss of your stock certificate. The Company may also require that you provide a customary indemnity agreement to the Company in
order to cover any potential loss.

 
Q: What happens if I sell my shares of common stock before completion of the Merger?
 
A: If you transfer your shares of common stock, you will have transferred your right to receive the Merger Consideration in the Merger.

In order to receive the Merger Consideration, you must hold your shares of common stock through completion of the Merger.
 

The Record Date for shareholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting is earlier than the consummation of the Merger. If you
transfer your shares of common stock after the Record Date but before the closing of the Merger, you will have transferred your right
to receive the Merger Consideration in the Merger, but retained the right to vote at the Special Meeting.
 

Q: Am I entitled to exercise appraisal rights instead of receiving the Merger Consideration for my shares of common stock?
 
A: Dissenting shareholders of record, as registered in the records of the Company, who do not vote in favor of the proposal to approve the

Merger Agreement and otherwise comply

with the requirements of Section 351.455 of the MGBCL are entitled to statutory appraisal rights under Missouri law in connection
with the Merger. This means that if you comply with the requirements of Section 351.455 of the MGBCL, you are entitled to have the
“fair value” (as defined pursuant to Section 351.455 of the MGBCL) of your shares of common stock determined in accordance with
Missouri law and to receive payment based on that valuation instead of receiving the Merger Consideration. The ultimate amount you
would receive in an appraisal proceeding may be more than, the same as or less than the amount you would have received under the
Merger Agreement. Failure to strictly comply with Section 351.455 of the MGBCL will result in your waiver of, or inability to
exercise, appraisal rights. See “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” and the text of the Missouri appraisal rights statute, Section 351.455
of the MGBCL, which is reproduced in its entirety as Annex C to this proxy statement. If you vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the
Merger Agreement, you will waive your appraisal rights, unless you revoke your proxy, if revocable, prior to the Special Meeting and
otherwise comply with Section 351.455 of the MGBCL.

 
 
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
 
A: If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., you are

considered, with respect to those shares, to be the “shareholder of record.” In this case, this proxy statement and your proxy card have
been sent directly to you by LMI.

 
If your shares are held through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you are considered the “beneficial owner” of shares of our
common stock held in “street name.” In that case, this proxy statement has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank, trustee or
other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, to be the shareholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the
right to direct your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee how to vote your shares by following their instructions for voting. You are
also invited to attend the Special Meeting. However, because you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote your shares in
person at the Special Meeting unless you obtain a “legal proxy” from your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee.
 

Q: If my broker holds my shares in “street name,” will my broker vote my shares for me?
 
A: Your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares on any proposal currently scheduled to be considered at

the Special Meeting and for which it does not have discretionary authority only if you instruct your broker, bank, trustee or other
nominee how to vote. You should follow the procedures provided by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee to vote your shares.
Without instructions, your shares will not be voted on such proposals, which will have the same effect as if you voted against adoption
of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, but will have no effect on the
proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt
the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 40/255

 

  
contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting, or the proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain
compensation that will or may become payable to LMI’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 
Q: Can I revoke my proxy?
 
A: Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting. If you are a shareholder of record, you

may revoke your proxy by notifying the Company’s Corporate Secretary in writing at 411 Fountain Lakes Boulevard St. Charles,
Missouri 63301, or by submitting a new proxy by telephone, the Internet or mail, in each case, dated after the date of the proxy being
revoked. In addition, you may revoke your proxy by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person (simply attending the Special
Meeting will not cause your proxy to be revoked). Please note that if you hold your shares in “street name” and you have instructed a
broker, bank, trustee or other nominee to vote your shares, the above-described options for revoking your voting instructions do not
apply, and instead you must follow the instructions received from your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee to revoke your voting
instructions.

 
Q: What is a proxy?
 
A: A proxy is your legal designation of another person, referred to as a “proxy,” to vote your shares of our common stock. The written

document describing the matters to be considered and voted on at the Special Meeting is called a “proxy statement.” The document
used to designate a proxy to vote your shares of our common stock is called a “proxy card.” Renée Skonier, our General Counsel and
Corporate Secretary, and Clifford C. Stebe, Jr., our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, with full power of substitution, are the
proxy holders for the Special Meeting.

 
Q: If a shareholder gives a proxy, how are the shares voted?
 
A: Regardless of the method you choose to vote, the proxy holders will vote your shares in the way that you indicate. When completing

the internet or telephone process or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against or to abstain
from voting on all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the Special Meeting.

 
If you properly sign your proxy card but do not mark the boxes showing how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares
represented by your properly signed proxy will be voted: (i) “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated thereby; (ii) “FOR” the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to
solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting; and (iii) “FOR” the proposal to approve, by non-binding,
advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to LMI’s named executive officers in connection with the
Merger.
 

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials?
 

29



9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 41/255

 

  
A: Please sign, date and return (or grant your proxy electronically over the Internet or by telephone) each proxy card and voting

instruction card that you receive.
 

You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or
voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate voting
instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a shareholder of record and your shares are registered
in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card.
 

Q: Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
 
A: LMI intends to publish final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC following the Special Meeting.

All reports that LMI files with the SEC are publicly available when filed. See the section of this proxy statement captioned “Where
You Can Find More Information.”

 
Q: Will I have to pay taxes on the Merger Consideration I receive?
 
A: The receipt of cash in exchange for shares of common stock pursuant to the Merger will generally be a taxable transaction for U.S.

federal income tax purposes. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the particular tax consequences to you of the
exchange of shares of common stock for cash pursuant to the Merger in light of your particular circumstances (including the
application and effect of any state, local or foreign income and other tax laws).

 
Q: What is householding and how does it affect me?
 
A: The SEC permits companies to send a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more shareholders reside, unless

contrary instructions have been received, but only if the applicable shareholder provides advance notice and follows certain
procedures.

 
In such cases, each shareholder continues to receive a separate notice of the meeting and proxy card. Certain brokerage firms may
have instituted householding for beneficial owners of common stock held through brokerage firms. If your family has multiple
accounts holding common stock, you may have already received householding notification from your broker. Please contact your
broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this proxy statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a
separate copy of this proxy statement promptly upon your written or oral request. You may decide at any time to revoke your decision
to household, and thereby receive multiple copies.
 

Q: When do you expect the Merger to be completed?
 
A: We are working toward completing the Merger as quickly as reasonably practicable and currently expect to complete the Merger by

the second half of 2017. However, the exact timing of completion of the Merger cannot be predicted because the Merger is subject to

the closing conditions described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Conditions to Completion
of the Merger,” many of which are outside of our control.
 

Q: If the Merger is completed, how will I receive the cash for my shares?
 
A: If the Merger is completed and your shares of our common stock are held in book-entry, the paying agent will issue and deliver to you

a check or wire transfer for your shares without any further action on your part. If you are a shareholder of record with your shares
held in certificate form, you will receive a letter of transmittal with instructions on how to send your shares of our common stock to
the paying agent in connection with the Merger. The paying agent will issue and deliver to you a check or wire transfer for your shares
after you comply with these instructions. Please do not send your stock certificates with your proxy card. See the section in this
proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Exchange and Payment Procedures.”

 
If your shares are held in “street name” by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you will receive instructions from your broker,
bank, trustee or other nominee as to how to effect the surrender of your shares held in “street name.”
 

Q: Do any of LMI’s directors or officers have interests in the Merger that may differ from those of LMI shareholders generally?
 
A: In considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors with respect to the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve

the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have
interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of shareholders generally. In (i) evaluating and negotiating
the Merger Agreement; (ii) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii) recommending that the Merger Agreement be
adopted by shareholders, the Board of Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time,
among other matters. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of LMI’s
Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger.”

 
Q: Are there any other risks to me from the Merger that I should consider?
 
A: Yes. There are risks associated with all business combinations, including the Merger. For further detail, see the section of this proxy

statement captioned “Forward-Looking Statements.”
 
Q: Who can help answer my other questions?
 
A: If you have more questions about the Merger, or require assistance in submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need additional

copies of the proxy statement or the enclosed proxy card, please contact Innisfree M&A Incorporated, which is acting as the proxy
solicitation agent and information agent for the Company in connection with the Merger.

THE SPECIAL MEETING

 
The enclosed proxy is solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors for use at the Special Meeting.
 

Date, Time and Place of the Special Meeting
 

We will hold the Special Meeting on June 8, 2017, at 10:00 a.m., Central time, at our principal executive offices at 411 Fountain Lakes
Boulevard, St. Charles, Missouri 63301.

 
Purpose of the Special Meeting
 

The purpose of the Special Meeting is for our shareholders to consider and vote upon the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement
relating to the proposed acquisition of the Company by Parent. Our shareholders must approve the Merger Agreement for the Merger to occur.
If our shareholders fail to approve the Merger Agreement, the Merger will not occur. A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached to this proxy
statement as Annex A and the material provisions of the Merger Agreement are described under the section of this proxy statement captioned
“The Merger Agreement.” Our shareholders are also being asked to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or
appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve the Merger Agreement.

 
In addition, in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the Company is providing its shareholders with the opportunity to

cast an advisory (non-binding) vote on the compensation that may be payable to its named executive officers in connection with the Merger, the
value of which is disclosed in the table in the section of the proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests of the Company’s Directors and
Executive Officers in the Merger.” The vote on executive compensation payable in connection with the Merger is a vote separate and apart from
the vote to approve the Merger. Accordingly, a shareholder may vote to approve the executive compensation and vote not to approve the
Merger and vice versa. Because the vote is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either the Company or Parent. Accordingly,
because the Company is contractually obligated to pay the compensation, the compensation will be payable, subject only to the conditions
applicable thereto, if the Merger is approved and regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote.

 
A copy of the Merger Agreement is attached as Annex A to this proxy statement. This proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy

are first being mailed to our shareholders on or about April 28, 2017.
 

Record Date; Shares Entitled to Vote; Quorum
 

The holders of record of common stock as of the close of business on April 21, 2017, the Record Date for the determination of
shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Special Meeting. On the
Record Date, 13,694,093 shares of common stock were outstanding.

 

36



9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 48/255

 

  
The presence at the Special Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of shares of common stock outstanding and

entitled to vote at the Special Meeting on the Record Date will constitute a quorum, permitting the Company to conduct its business at the
Special Meeting. Treasury shares, which are shares owned by the Company itself, are not voted and do not count for this purpose. Once a share
is represented at the Special Meeting, it will be counted for the purpose of determining a quorum at the Special Meeting. However, if a new
Record Date is set for the adjourned Special Meeting, then a new quorum will have to be established. Proxies received but marked as
abstentions will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the Special Meeting. If less than a majority of
the shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting are represented at the meeting, the shareholders entitled to
vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, may adjourn the Special Meeting from time to time without notice other than
announcement at the meeting (unless a new Record Date is set) to any shareholder not present at the Special Meeting, to a specified date not
later than ninety (90) days after such adjournment.

 
Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
 

For the Company to complete the Merger, under the MGBCL, shareholders holding at least two-thirds of the shares of common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting at the close of business on the Record Date must affirmatively vote “FOR” the proposal
to approve the Merger Agreement. In addition, under the Merger Agreement, the receipt of such required vote is a condition to the
consummation of the Merger. A failure to vote your shares of common stock, an abstention from voting or a broker non-vote will have the same
effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement.

 
Approval of each of the adjournment proposal and the advisory (non-binding) proposal on executive compensation payable to the

Company’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of
common stock present or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions will have the same effect as a
vote “AGAINST” the adjournment proposal and the advisory (non-binding) proposal but the failure to vote your shares and broker non-votes
will have no effect on the outcome of the adjournment proposal and the advisory (non-binding) proposal.

 
As of the Record Date, there were 13,694,093 shares of common stock outstanding.
 

Shares Held by LMI’s Directors and Executive Officers
 

At the close of business on the Record Date, directors and executive officers of the Company and their subsidiaries were entitled to
vote 2,166,327 shares of common stock, or approximately 15.9% of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding on that date.

 
Voting of Proxies
 

Attendance
 
All holders of shares of common stock as of the close of business on April 21, 2017, the Record Date for voting at the Special

Meeting, including shareholders of record and beneficial

owners of common stock registered in the “street name” of a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, are invited to attend the Special Meeting. If
you are a shareholder of record, please be prepared to provide proper identification, such as a driver’s license. If you hold your shares in “street
name,” you will need to provide proof of ownership, such as a recent account statement or voting instruction form provided by your broker,
bank, trustee or other nominee or other similar evidence of ownership, along with proper identification.

 
Voting in Person
 
Shareholders of record will be able to vote in person at the Special Meeting. If you are not a shareholder of record, but instead hold

your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you must provide a proxy executed in your favor from your
broker, bank, trustee or other nominee in order to be able to vote in person at the Special Meeting.

 
Submitting a Proxy or Providing Voting Instructions
 
To ensure that your shares are voted at the Special Meeting, we recommend that you provide voting instructions promptly by proxy,

even if you plan to attend the Special Meeting in person.
 
Shares Held by Record Holder. If you are a shareholder of record, you may submit a proxy using one of the methods described below:
 
Submit a Proxy by Telephone or via the Internet. This proxy statement is accompanied by a proxy card with instructions for submitting

voting instructions. You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free number or via the Internet by accessing the Internet address as specified
on the enclosed proxy card. Your shares will be voted as you direct in the same manner as if you had completed, signed, dated and returned
your proxy card, as described below.

 
Submit a Proxy Card. If you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card by mail so that it is received in time for the

Special Meeting, your shares will be voted in the manner directed by you on your proxy card. If you sign, date and return your proxy card
without indicating how you wish to vote, your proxy will be voted in favor of each of the proposals to approve the Merger Agreement, the
advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve specified compensation that may become payable to the named executive officers of the Company
in connection with the Merger, and the proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies. If you
are a shareholder of record and fail to return your proxy card, unless you are a holder of record on the Record Date and attend the Special
Meeting and vote in person, the effect will be that your shares will not be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at
the Special Meeting and will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, but will not affect the vote
regarding the adjournment of the Special Meeting or the advisory (non-binding) proposal to approve specified compensation that may become
payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the Merger, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies.

 
Shares Held in “Street Name.” If your shares are held by a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee on your behalf in “street name,”

your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee will send

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 50/255

 

  
you instructions as to how to provide voting instructions for your shares. Many banks and brokerage firms have a process for their customers to
provide voting instructions by telephone or via the Internet, in addition to providing voting instructions by a voting instruction form.

 
In accordance with the rules of the NASDAQ, brokers, banks, trustees or other nominees who hold shares of common stock in “street

name” for their customers do not have discretionary authority to vote the shares with respect to the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement.
Accordingly, if brokers, banks, trustees or other nominees do not receive specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares
they may not vote such shares with respect to the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement. Under such circumstance, such broker non-votes
will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, but will have no effect on the adjournment
proposal or the advisory (non-binding) proposal on executive compensation payable to the Company’s named executive officers in connection
with the Merger. However, broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Special Meeting.
For shares of common stock held in “street name,” only shares of common stock affirmatively voted “FOR” the proposal to approve the
Merger Agreement will be counted as a favorable vote for such proposal.

 
Revocability of Proxies
 

Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke and change it any time before it is voted. If you are a
shareholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the vote is taken at the Special Meeting by:

 
● submitting a new proxy with a later date, by using the telephone or Internet proxy submission procedures described above, or

by completing, signing, dating and returning a new proxy card by mail to the Company;
 

● attending the Special Meeting and voting in person; or
 

● delivering to the Corporate Secretary of the Company a written notice of revocation c/o LMI Aerospace, Inc., 411 Fountain
Lakes Boulevard, St. Charles, Missouri 63301.

 
Please note, however, that only your last-dated proxy will count. Attending the Special Meeting without taking one of the actions

described above will not in itself revoke your proxy. Please note that if you want to revoke your proxy by mailing a new proxy card to the
Company or by sending a written notice of revocation to the Company, you should ensure that you send your new proxy card or written notice
of revocation in sufficient time for it to be received by the Company before the Special Meeting.

 
If you hold your shares in “street name” through a broker, bank, trustee or other nominee, you will need to follow the instructions

provided to you by your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee in order to revoke your proxy or submit new voting instructions.
 

Recommendation of LMI’s Board of Directors

9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 51/255

 

  
The Board of Directors, other than Daniel G. Korte, a member of the Board of Directors and the Company’s President and Chief

Executive Officer, who abstained from voting due to his interests in the transaction as described in the section of the proxy statement captioned
“The Merger—Interests of LMI’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” unanimously approved the terms of the Merger Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. The Board of Directors, with Mr. Korte abstaining, therefore recommends that you
vote “FOR” the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, “FOR” the
adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger
Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting; and “FOR” the
proposal to approve, by non-binding, advisory vote, certain compensation that will or may become payable to LMI’s named executive officers
in connection with the Merger.

 
Adjournments and Postponements
 

Although it is not currently expected, the Special Meeting may be adjourned or postponed for the purpose of soliciting additional
proxies. In the event that there is present, in person or by proxy, sufficient favorable voting power to secure the vote of the shareholders of the
Company necessary to approve the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement, the Company does not anticipate that it will adjourn or
postpone the Special Meeting unless it is advised by counsel that failure to do so could reasonably be expected to result in a violation of
applicable law.

 
The Special Meeting may be adjourned by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present in

person or represented by proxy at the Special Meeting and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. Any signed proxies received by the Company
in which no voting instructions are provided on such matter will be voted in favor of an adjournment in these circumstances.

 
Any adjournment or postponement of the Special Meeting for the purpose of soliciting additional proxies will allow the Company’s

shareholders who have already sent in their proxies to revoke them at any time prior to their use at the Special Meeting as adjourned or
postponed.

 
Solicitation of Proxies
 

The Board of Directors is soliciting your proxy, and we will bear the cost of soliciting proxies. This includes the charges and expenses
of brokerage firms and others for forwarding solicitation material to beneficial owners of our outstanding common stock. Innisfree M&A
Incorporated, a proxy solicitation firm (“Innisfree”), has been retained to assist it in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting and we
will pay Innisfree a fee of approximately $25,000, plus certain costs associated with additional services, if required. Proxies may be solicited by
mail, personal interview, e-mail, telephone, or via the Internet by Innisfree or, without additional compensation by certain of the Company’s
directors, officers and employees.

Appraisal Rights
 

Shareholders of the Company are entitled to dissent from the Merger. If a shareholder elects to dissent from the Merger, such
shareholder will be entitled to receive the “fair value” of his, her, or its shares of LMI’s common stock if such shareholder complies with the
provisions of Section 351.455 of the MGBCL regarding appraisal rights (we refer to such shares as, “appraisal shares”). Attached as Annex C
to this proxy statement is a copy of the relevant section of the MGBCL regarding such appraisal rights. Appraisal shares will not be converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration. A summary of LMI shareholders’ appraisal rights under the MGBCL is provided under “The
Merger—Appraisal Rights.”

 
To assert appraisal rights, a dissenting shareholder must comply with Section 351.455 of the MGBCL, which requires, among other

things, that such shareholder give LMI written notice of his, her or its objection to the Merger Agreement prior to or at the Special Meeting and
that such shareholder not vote his, her or its shares in favor of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby.
Any shareholder who returns a signed proxy but fails to provide instructions on the manner in which such shareholder’s shares are to be voted
will be deemed to have voted “FOR” the Merger. See “The Merger—Appraisal Rights” for additional information.

 
Other Matters
 

You should not return your stock certificate or send documents representing common stock with the proxy card. If the Merger is
completed, the paying agent for the Merger will send you a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging your shares of common stock
for the Merger Consideration.

Under applicable law, we cannot complete the Merger without the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of

Sonaca USA Inc.
 

Intermediate Co is a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Sonaca. Intermediate Co was formed in
September 2015 by Sonaca as a future platform for Sonaca’s United States operations and for the purpose of potentially serving as an
acquisition vehicle, but it does not have, and has never had, any operations.

 
Intermediate Co’s principal executive office is located at c/o Sonaca S.A., Route nationale 5, 6041 Gosselies, Belgium, and its

telephone number is +32.71.25.51.11.
 

Luminance Merger Sub, Inc.
 

Sub is a Missouri corporation, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Sonaca and direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Intermediate Co.
Sub formed on February 14, 2017 solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement. Sub has not engaged in any business activities except activities incidental to its formation and in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 
Sub’s principal executive office is located at c/o Sonaca S.A., Route nationale 5, 6041 Gosselies, Belgium, and its telephone number is

+32.71.25.51.11.
 

Effect of the Merger
 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, if the Merger is completed, Sub will merge with and into LMI,
and LMI will continue as the surviving corporation, and as a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Sonaca, and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary
of Intermediate Co. As a result of the Merger, LMI common stock will no longer be publicly traded and will be delisted from NASDAQ. In
addition, our common stock will be deregistered under the Exchange Act, and we will no longer file periodic or current reports with the SEC. If
the Merger is completed, you will not own any shares of the capital stock of the surviving corporation.

 
The effective time of the Merger will occur upon the filing of summary articles of merger with the Secretary of State of Missouri, or at

such other time as Sonaca and LMI shall agree and specify in the summary articles of merger.
 

Effect on LMI if the Merger is Not Completed
 

If the Merger Agreement is not adopted and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby are not approved by
shareholders or if the Merger is not completed for any other reason, LMI shareholders will not receive any payment for their shares of our
common stock. Instead, LMI will remain an independent public company, and our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on
NASDAQ and registered under the Exchange Act and we will continue to file periodic and current reports with the SEC. In addition, if the
Merger is not completed, we expect that management will operate the business in a manner similar to that in which it is being operated today
and that shareholders will continue to be subject to the same risks and opportunities to which they are currently subject, including, among other
things, the

nature of the industry on which our business largely depends, and general industry, economic, regulatory and market conditions.

 
Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, depending on the circumstances that caused the Merger not to be completed, the price of

our common stock may decline significantly. If that were to occur, it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of our common stock would return to
the price at which it trades as of the date of this proxy statement.

 
Accordingly, if the Merger is not completed, there can be no assurance as to the effect of these risks and opportunities on the future

value of your shares of our common stock. If the Merger is not completed, the Board of Directors will continue to evaluate and review LMI’s
business operations, strategic direction and capitalization, among other things, and will make such changes as are deemed appropriate. If the
Merger Agreement is not adopted and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby are not approved by shareholders or if the
Merger is not completed for any other reason, there can be no assurance that any other transaction acceptable to the Board of Directors will be
offered or that LMI’s business, prospects or results of operation will not be adversely impacted.

 
If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be obligated to pay Sonaca a break-up fee of $15 million.

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Break-Up Fees.”
 

Merger Consideration
 

At the effective time of the Merger, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of
the Merger (including any shares resulting from the settlement of Restricted Shares and RSUs which become vested immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger as a result of the consummation of the Merger, but excluding excluded shares and appraisal shares), will be
cancelled and automatically converted into the right to receive $14.00 in cash, without interest, and subject to deduction for any required
withholding tax. As of the effective time of the Merger, all shares of our common stock will be cancelled and will thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with, and subject to, the conditions of the Merger Agreement. At the
effective time of the Merger, each share of our common stock held by the Parent, Intermediate Co, or Sub, will be automatically canceled
without payment of any consideration. In addition, each share of our common stock held by a shareholder who is entitled to and who properly
exercises appraisal rights under the MGBCL, will not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, unless and until such
shareholder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such shareholder’s right to appraisal under Section 351.455 of the MGBCL, at
which time each such share of our common stock will be converted into and will be exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the later of
the effective time of the Merger and the time that such right to appraisal is irrevocably lost, the Merger Consideration. Appraisal shares shall be
treated in accordance with Section 351.455 of the MGBCL, as more fully described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger—Appraisal Rights.”

Background of the Merger
 

The Board of Directors and management of the Company regularly evaluate the Company’s long-term strategic plan with the goal of
maximizing shareholder value. As part of this ongoing process, the Board of Directors and management of the Company have periodically
considered a variety of potential strategic alternatives relating to the Company’s business, including the continuation of the Company’s business
plan as a standalone enterprise, potential strategic alliances and other commercial arrangements, modifications to the Company’s strategy,
prospects for strategic mergers and acquisitions and other business combinations and sales of certain divisions.

 
On November 4, 2016, and without prior solicitation from the Company or its advisors, a representative of Sonaca’s financial advisor,

Credit Suisse AG (“Credit Suisse”), contacted Gregory Summe, a member of the Board of Directors, and verbally indicated that Sonaca was
interested in making an offer to acquire 100% of the stock of the Company for cash. Credit Suisse had first attempted to contact Gerald Daniels,
Chairman of the Board of Directors, but had been unable to reach him prior to contacting Mr. Summe. Mr. Summe immediately referred the
inquiry to Mr. Daniels.

 
Later that same day, on November 4, 2016, and without prior solicitation from the Company or its advisors, Bernard Delvaux, Chief

Executive Officer of Sonaca, submitted a written letter addressed to Mr. Daniels, expressing Sonaca’s interest in a possible business
combination transaction with the Company. The letter envisioned a transaction whereby Sonaca would acquire 100% of the stock of the
Company for cash and indicated that, based on Sonaca’s review of publicly-available information, it currently assigned a value range to the
Company of $11.00 – $12.50 per share of Company common stock. The letter stated that Sonaca was familiar with the Company’s business and
described a number of perceived corporate and business synergies between the Company and Sonaca. The letter noted that a potential
acquisition of the Company was a strategic priority for Sonaca and that Sonaca was prepared promptly to commit the necessary resources to
complete confirmatory due diligence and negotiate a definitive merger agreement. The letter indicated that Sonaca had already retained Credit
Suisse as its financial advisor and Kaye Scholer LLP (now known as Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer) (“APKS”) as its outside legal counsel. The
letter requested a 30-day exclusivity period in which to perform additional due diligence, after which Sonaca would be willing to consider
increasing the proposed price if its due diligence identified additional value. Enclosed with the letter was a proposed form of exclusivity
agreement. On November 4, 2016, the closing price per share of Company common stock on NASDAQ was $7.49.

 
On November 5, 2016, the Company contacted Lazard and expressed its desire to retain Lazard as the Company’s financial advisor in

evaluating and responding to Sonaca’s proposal.
 
On November 7, 2016, the Board of Directors contacted Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP (“Gibson Dunn”) and expressed its desire to

retain Gibson Dunn as its outside legal advisor to advise on matters relating to the Sonaca proposal.
 
On November 7, 2016, the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of Company management present, to discuss

the particulars of Sonaca’s proposal and the merits

9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

and risks of exploring a potential transaction with Sonaca, including preliminary perspectives on the price range indicated in the November 4
letter from Mr. Delvaux. At the request of the Board of Directors, representatives of both Gibson Dunn and Lazard, each of which has extensive
experience in transactions of this type, were also present for the meeting. The Board of Directors discussed with representatives of Gibson
Dunn and Lazard various alternatives to a transaction with Sonaca and processes for exploring a potential strategic transaction with Sonaca,
including an initial discussion about the merits and challenges of proceeding exclusively with Sonaca for a period of time. A representative of
Gibson Dunn reviewed the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors in the context of an acquisition proposal generally and with respect to
Sonaca’s proposal specifically.

 
On November 8, 2016, Mr. Daniels, on behalf of the Board of Directors, delivered a written letter to Mr. Delvaux acknowledging

receipt of Sonaca’s letter and explaining that the Board of Directors had met to discuss the proposal and had engaged resources to assist in its
investigation of the matter. The letter did not provide any feedback to Mr. Delvaux on either the valuation of Sonaca’s indication of interest or
its request for exclusivity.

 
On November 11, 2016, the Board of Directors entered into an engagement letter to formally retain Gibson Dunn as its outside legal

counsel.
 
On November 12, 2016, the Board of Directors convened a telephonic meeting, with members of Company management and

representatives of Lazard and Gibson Dunn present. The Board of Directors discussed certain financial analyses prepared by Lazard at the
request of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors also further discussed the merits and risks of proceeding exclusively with Sonaca and,
if the Company were to consider proceeding exclusively with Sonaca for a period of time, the appropriate parameters of any exclusivity period.
A representative of Gibson Dunn reviewed the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors in considering and responding to an acquisition
proposal as well as in relation to Sonaca’s request for exclusivity. It was decided that Daniel G. Korte, President and Chief Executive Officer of
the Company, would call Mr. Delvaux to suggest a meeting between the Company and Sonaca management teams, and would indicate on that
call that the Company was not prepared to grant exclusivity at the time. After further discussion, for purposes of administrative efficiency in
order to facilitate the Board of Directors’ evaluation of a potential acquisition of the Company, and not due to any actual or potential conflict of
interest, the Board of Directors established an ad hoc board committee, referred to as the “Sunburst Committee,” consisting of independent
directors Mr. Daniels, John Eulich and Mr. Summe; Lawrence Resnick (who was then a special advisor to the Board of Directors on strategic
and industry matters) was appointed to advise the Sunburst Committee. Mr. Resnick later became a member of the Sunburst Committee upon
joining the Board of Directors effective January 1, 2017. The Sunburst Committee was empowered to evaluate the potential transaction and
report back to the full Board of Directors as material developments should arise.

 
On November 13, 2016, Mr. Korte and Mr. Delvaux spoke by telephone to discuss general perspectives on and Sonaca’s rationale

regarding the potential fit and strategic alignment of the Company’s and Sonaca’s respective businesses. Mr. Korte also expressed to Mr.
Delvaux that, in light of the Company’s status as a publicly-traded company and its fiduciary duties to shareholders, the Board of Directors
could not, without sufficient justification, at the time

entertain a grant of exclusivity and would in any event require ample opportunity for a market check either before doing so or affirmatively
after signing any definitive agreement that may evolve.

 
On November 14, 2016, Mr. Delvaux sent a written letter to Mr. Korte reiterating Sonaca’s requirement for exclusivity in order to

conduct further due diligence for the purpose of determining its ability to increase its previously indicated value range. The letter indicated that,
while Sonaca was not prepared to proceed on any basis other than exclusivity, it would be willing to consider a shorter, 21-day exclusivity
period and was also prepared to narrow the range of its diligence inquiry to a short list of what it considered to be the most important items
based on its prior review of publicly-available information. Mr. Delvaux also acknowledged that Sonaca envisioned that any definitive
agreement between the two companies would include a post-signing market check provision.

 
On November 15, 2016, the Sunburst Committee held a telephonic meeting, with members of Company management and

representatives of Lazard also present. The Sunburst Committee discussed the November 14 letter from Mr. Delvaux and, in particular,
Sonaca’s expressed willingness to agree to a shorter exclusivity period, agreement in principle to a go-shop provision and the proposed scope of
the initial diligence effort. Following discussion of various options with respect to exclusivity, the Sunburst Committee agreed that it was in the
best interests of the Company’s shareholders for the Company to negotiate and execute with Sonaca a confidentiality agreement containing a
standstill provision and granting exclusivity for a period of ten calendar days, after which time a higher value range would need to be provided
in order for the Company to agree to extend exclusivity for an additional 11 calendar days.

 
On November 17, 2016, the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting, with Company management present, to discuss the Sunburst

Committee’s recommendation that the Company agree to the exclusivity framework previously discussed by the Sunburst Committee. Namely,
the Company would provide Sonaca with exclusivity for an initial period of ten calendar days, during which period the Company would furnish
Sonaca with a limited set of non-public information (to be agreed upon in advance by the Company and Sonaca) in order to facilitate the
submission by Sonaca of a revised non-binding proposal reflecting an increased value range. If the higher value range justified doing so, the
Company would agree to extend the exclusivity period for an additional 11 calendar days. After discussion, the Board of Directors agreed that it
was in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders to enter into an appropriate confidentiality and standstill agreement with Sonaca, which
would contain an exclusivity provision, and to prepare information about the Company that would allow Sonaca to possibly revise upwards the
value range it would assign to the Company.

 
Between November 16, 2016 and November 23, 2016, the Company, Sonaca and their respective counsel negotiated the terms of a

confidentiality agreement that included customary standstill and non-solicitation provisions. The Company and Sonaca executed the
confidentiality agreement on November 23, 2016. The confidentiality agreement provided Sonaca exclusivity with respect to a potential
acquisition of the Company until December 6, 2016, longer than the originally proposed ten calendar day period in part because of the
upcoming Thanksgiving holiday weekend. The confidentiality agreement also provided for the possibility of an exclusivity extension for an
additional 11 calendar days if, on or before December 6, 2016,

Sonaca submitted to the Company an updated written indication of interest with a per share purchase price range reflecting the results of
Sonaca’s due diligence findings, and such per share purchase price range represented a range which the Board of Directors determined
warranted a continuation of discussions. Under the confidentiality agreement, the initial exclusivity end date of December 6, 2016 would
extend on a daily basis until the Company provided to Sonaca substantially all of the items enumerated in an agreed-upon due diligence request
list that was negotiated in parallel with the confidentiality agreement.

 
Also on November 23, 2016, the Company executed a formal engagement letter with Lazard in connection with the potential sale of

the Company.
 
On November 24, 2016, the Company provided substantially all of the due diligence materials enumerated in the initial due diligence

request list, such that the initial exclusivity period would expire on December 7, 2016 unless extended by the Board of Directors in its
discretion pursuant to the confidentiality agreement. These initial due diligence materials provided by the Company to Sonaca included the
Company’s August 2016 Plan, which had been previously approved by the Board of Directors in August 2016 and is defined and described in
the section captioned “—Management Projections.”

 
On November 29, 2016, the Board of Directors convened a brief telephonic meeting, with members of Company management present.

Mr. Korte updated the Board of Directors on the Company’s execution of a confidentiality agreement with Sonaca just prior to the
Thanksgiving holiday weekend, the key terms of the agreement and the status of the initial diligence production.

 
On the evening of December 1, 2016, Mr. Korte, Clifford C. Stebe, Jr., the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, and Lawrence E. (Ed)

Dickinson, principal at Aerospace Consulting, LLC, the former chief financial officer of the Company and currently a strategic consultant to the
Company, met over dinner in New York City with Mr. Delvaux, Pierre Sonveaux, Chairman and President of Sonaca, and Erik van Ockenburg,
Chief Financial Officer and Strategy Officer of Sonaca. Messrs. Korte, Stebe, Dickinson, Delvaux, Sonveaux and van Ockenburg were also
accompanied by representatives of Lazard and Credit Suisse. The dinner was primarily of a social and introductory nature in advance of the
next day’s scheduled diligence session.

 
On December 2, 2016, representatives of the Company and Sonaca, including Messrs. Korte, Stebe, Dickinson, Delvaux, Sonveaux

and van Ockenburg, along with additional Sonaca executives and accompanied by representatives of Lazard, Credit Suisse and Deloitte
(Sonaca’s accounting and tax advisor), held an in-person meeting at Lazard’s New York office to review the initial due diligence materials that
the Company had provided on November 24, 2016. The discussion covered aspects of the Company’s operations, content programs and
financial performance.

 
On December 5, 2016, Mr. Delvaux submitted a written letter addressed to Messrs. Daniels and Korte revising Sonaca’s non-binding

indication of interest to acquire 100% of the Company’s stock for cash at an increased value range of $12.50 – $13.75 per share. The closing
price per share of Company common stock on NASDAQ on December 5, 2016 was $9.03. In light of the increased value range stated in
Sonaca’s revised proposal, the letter requested (in

9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 61/255

 

  
accordance with the confidentiality agreement) an 11 calendar day extension to the original December 7, 2016 exclusivity termination date, in
order to provide Sonaca an opportunity to review additional due diligence materials to be set forth in an expanded due diligence request list for
the purpose of enabling Sonaca to formalize an offer by the expiration of such 11-day period.

 
The next day, on December 6, 2016, the Sunburst Committee convened a telephonic meeting to consider Sonaca’s revised indication of

interest and request for extension of exclusivity, with members of Company management and representatives of Lazard and Gibson Dunn
present. Members of Company management and representatives of Lazard recounted meetings and discussions with Sonaca and Credit Suisse
to date. The Sunburst Committee instructed Lazard to update certain financial analyses on the basis of Sonaca’s most recent offer for
presentation to the Sunburst Committee at another meeting scheduled for the next day, at which the Sunburst Committee would decide on a
response to Sonaca’s December 5 proposal.

 
On December 7, 2016, the Sunburst Committee convened a telephonic meeting, with members of Company management and

representatives of Lazard present. After discussing with Lazard certain of its updated financial analyses and deliberating further, the Sunburst
Committee determined that Sonaca’s December 5, 2016 revised indication of interest offered inadequate value for the Company’s shareholders
and did not warrant a continuation of discussions with Sonaca nor an extension of exclusivity.

 
On December 7, 2016, the Company sent a written letter to Mr. Delvaux informing him that, after careful consideration of Sonaca’s

December 5, 2016 revised indication of interest, including consultations with its financial and legal advisors, the Board of Directors had
determined a continuation of discussions with Sonaca was not warranted and that, consequently, the exclusivity period contemplated in the
confidentiality agreement had expired.

 
Following delivery of the December 7, 2016 letter to Sonaca until December 16, 2016, there was no further contact between the

Company and Sonaca.
 
On December 8, 2016, Mr. Daniels held an informal telephone conference with two other members of the Board of Directors (who

were not serving on the Sunburst Committee) to update them on developments to date.
 
On December 16, 2016, Mr. Delvaux submitted a written letter to Mr. Daniels, which included a revised non-binding indication of

interest to acquire 100% of the stock of the Company for cash at a value range of $13.00 – $16.00 per share. The letter indicated that the
increased value range was predicated on fulfillment of certain additional due diligence requests and further discussions and meetings with
Company management in order to confirm Sonaca’s revised assumptions. The letter also stated that Sonaca would seek, as part of a transaction,
an agreement in principle on the terms of an employment agreement with Mr. Korte until at least December 31, 2019. The letter requested a
new exclusivity period ending at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on January 22, 2017, assuming receipt of the specified further due diligence
information on or before 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on January 2, 2017.

 
Later in the afternoon on December 16, 2016, the Sunburst Committee, with Company management and representatives of Lazard and

Gibson Dunn present, convened a telephonic

9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

meeting to discuss the revised indication of interest from Sonaca and the merits and risks of entering into a new exclusivity period with Sonaca
until January 22, 2017. The Sunburst Committee sought input from Company management on the feasibility of the outlined process. A
representative of Gibson Dunn reviewed again the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors and recommended inclusion of a go-shop
provision in a definitive acquisition agreement, should one be executed. After discussion, the Sunburst Committee instructed Gibson Dunn to
prepare an addendum to the existing confidentiality agreement with Sonaca that would provide Sonaca with exclusivity as outlined in its
December 16, 2016 letter, but subject to a “drop-dead” exclusivity termination date of January 31, 2017 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time regardless of
whether the Company had delivered substantially all of the requested additional due diligence information by 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on
January 2, 2017 or thereafter. Based on the facts then known to it and to the Board of Directors, the Sunburst Committee also instructed Lazard
to verbally communicate to Credit Suisse that Sonaca’s next revised proposal would need to fall at the higher end of the indicated value range
in order for the Board of Directors to view it as compelling at such time.

 
On December 19, 2016, the Company and Sonaca entered into an addendum to the November 23, 2016 confidentiality agreement.

Under this addendum, the Company endeavored to provide certain requested additional due diligence information to Sonaca regarding the
Company’s businesses and products and agreed to provide Sonaca with exclusivity from December 19, 2016 until 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on
January 22, 2017. The exclusivity period would extend on a daily basis if the Company did not provide substantially all of the agreed-upon
additional due diligence information by 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on January 2, 2017 but would in any event terminate on January 31, 2017 at
11:59 p.m. Eastern time. The addendum reiterated the Company’s expectation that if a definitive agreement were to be executed, such definitive
agreement would include a post-signing market check provision.

 
On January 2, 2017, in accordance with the confidentiality agreement (as amended by the December 19, 2016 addendum), Lazard, on

behalf of the Company, delivered the agreed-upon additional due diligence materials to Credit Suisse, on behalf of Sonaca. The Company
concurrently notified Sonaca in writing that such delivery constituted substantially all of the requested information, and that, in accordance with
the terms of the confidentiality agreement (as amended by the December 19, 2016 addendum), exclusivity would terminate on January 22,
2017.

 
On January 4, 2017, Messrs. Korte, Stebe and Dickinson held a financial diligence call with representatives of the Sonaca management

team, including Paul Costanzo, Chief Financial Officer of Sonaca Montreal.
 
On January 6, 2017, Mr. Stebe and other members of the Company’s management team, accompanied by the Company’s independent

auditor, held two due diligence calls with Mr. Costanzo and other representatives of the Sonaca management team covering tax and audit
diligence matters, respectively.

 
In response to Sonaca’s legal and confirmatory due diligence requests, the Company established an online data room that was

populated with certain non-public information regarding the Company’s organization, business and operations, properties and employees, as
 

51



9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

well as tax, legal and miscellaneous matters, in response to Sonaca’s specific legal diligence requests. On January 9, 2017, Lazard provided
access to these due diligence materials to Sonaca through the online data room in order to facilitate the completion of Sonaca’s confirmatory
due diligence.

 
Also on January 9, 2017, and from time to time thereafter through the execution of the Merger Agreement (including on January 17,

2017, January 23, 2017 and February 6, 2017), members of the Company’s in-house legal team held telephone calls and exchanged e-mails
with representatives of APKS regarding legal diligence requests.

 
On January 9-10, 2017, Mr. Korte accompanied Sonaca operations executives on facility site visits to the Company’s facilities located

in Vista, California; Fredonia, Kansas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Cottonwood, Kansas; Washington, Missouri; and St. Charles, Missouri.
 
On January 11-12, 2017, representatives of the Company, including Messrs. Korte, Stebe, Dickinson, and Ms. Renée Skonier, General

Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer of the Company, and representatives of Sonaca, including Messrs. Delvaux, van Ockenburg, Costanzo
and other Sonaca executives, accompanied by representatives of Lazard and Credit Suisse, conducted in-person meetings in St. Louis, Missouri
to review ongoing due diligence requests.

 
Also on the evening of January 11, 2017, Messrs. Korte and Delvaux met in St. Louis, Missouri, over dinner and held general

discussions regarding the employment arrangements envisioned for Mr. Korte and potentially Mr. Stebe, if a transaction were to occur, the
negotiation of which arrangements would be directed and overseen by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (which is
comprised solely of independent directors). Messrs. Korte and Delvaux also further discussed their views on the potential strategic alignment of
the Company’s and Sonaca’s respective businesses. Neither Mr. Korte nor Mr. Stebe were members of either the Sunburst Committee or the
Compensation Committee of the Board.

 
On January 12, 2017, Messrs. Stebe and Dickinson held a telephone conference with financial executives of Sonaca regarding various

financial diligence matters.
 
On January 13, 2017, Messrs. Stebe and Costanzo spoke again by telephone regarding certain follow-up financial diligence matters.
 
On January 16, 2017, Messrs. Korte, Stebe and Dickinson held a call with representatives of Sonaca to discuss the diligence process

and address particular follow-up diligence inquiries.
 
Between January 18-27, 2017 Messrs. Korte and Delvaux spoke from time to time by telephone about potential compensation

structures for the Company leadership team following a transaction, if a transaction should occur, the negotiation of which was being directed
and overseen by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (which is comprised solely of independent directors). The nature of the
potential compensation structures discussed included a general discussion of base salary, bonus and long-term incentive structure and
severance.

 
On January 18, 2017, Messrs. Stebe and Costanzo spoke by telephone regarding certain follow-up financial diligence matters.

On January 19, 2017, Mr. Delvaux submitted a written letter to Mr. Korte, expressing Sonaca’s continued interest in a potential

transaction and requesting an extension of the exclusivity period from 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on January 22, 2017 until 5:00 p.m. Eastern time
on January 27, 2017, in order to give Sonaca additional time to evaluate recently received due diligence information in order to be able to make
a final price per share proposal. The letter transmitted a preliminary draft Merger Agreement for the Company’s review.

 
On January 20, 2017 (and again on February 7, 2017), Mr. Stebe e-mailed Mr. Costanzo in response to particular follow-up financial

diligence inquiries.
 
On January 21, 2017, Mr. Korte sent a written letter to Mr. Delvaux agreeing to extend the exclusivity period until 5:00 p.m. Eastern

time on January 27, 2017 in light of Sonaca’s need to complete its review of the diligence materials provided and obtain required approvals of
its final price per share proposal.

 
On January 23, 2017, the Sunburst Committee held a telephonic meeting, with representatives of Lazard and Gibson Dunn present, to

review key terms of the preliminary draft Merger Agreement prepared by APKS. The draft Merger Agreement provided for the acquisition of
the Company pursuant to a reverse triangular merger of an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Sonaca with and into the Company, with the
Company surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Sonaca. The draft also provided for the full acceleration of
outstanding equity awards of the Company and a 21-day “go-shop” period during which the Company could actively solicit alternative
proposals from other parties, followed by a “no-shop” period during which the Company could only pursue certain unsolicited alternative
proposals (in addition to continuing to pursue certain qualifying proposals received during the “go-shop” period). The draft provided for Sonaca
to obtain a combination of debt and equity financing to fund the merger consideration, and included a break-up fee payable by the Company to
Sonaca as Sonaca’s sole remedy in certain specified circumstances and a reverse break-up fee payable by Sonaca to the Company as the
Company’s sole remedy in certain specified circumstances (including in the event of Sonaca’s failure to obtain financing). The Sunburst
Committee discussed with the representatives of Gibson Dunn and Lazard the potential implications of various key provisions in the draft
Merger Agreement, including in particular the potential risks that the proposed financing structure and reverse break-up fee construct could
pose to deal certainty.

 
Later that same day, on January 23, 2017, representatives of Gibson Dunn called representatives of APKS to provide initial feedback

on material issues raised by the draft Merger Agreement, including the Company’s requirement for greater deal certainty and comfort regarding
Sonaca’s financing arrangements (specifically, a right to full specific performance and uncapped damages for breach, including in a
circumstance where Sonaca was unable to perform due to a financing failure, and removal of the reverse break-up fee concept), a longer “go-
shop” period, and a more flexible standard under which the Board of Directors could exercise its “fiduciary out.”

 
On January 27, 2017, a representative of Credit Suisse called a representative of Lazard to verbally indicate a revised proposal with a

value of $14.00 per share of Company common

stock. On January 27, 2017, the closing price per share of Company common stock on NASDAQ was $8.90.

 
On January 27, 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of Company

management and representatives of the Compensation Committee’s outside compensation consultant also present. The Compensation
Committee discussed the potential impact of a transaction with Sonaca on executive employment agreements and incentives and sought input
from its consultant on certain matters, including the proposed treatment of outstanding equity awards in the transaction, insight into current
market practices and the consultant’s in-process analysis of certain tax-related considerations under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).

 
The next morning, on January 28, 2017, the Sunburst Committee convened a telephonic meeting to consider Sonaca’s revised proposal

of $14.00 per share. Also in attendance were members of Company management and representatives of Gibson Dunn and Lazard. In addition to
discussing the price terms of the latest offer, the Sunburst Committee also discussed certain other terms of the proposal including Sonaca’s
request for a commitment on new employment contracts with four to six members of the Company management team (Messrs. Korte and Stebe
and other executives not specified) and the scheduling of introductory telephone calls with Messrs. Korte and Delvaux and the Company’s three
largest customers. After deliberating on the merits and risks of possible alternative responses to Sonaca’s current proposal, the Sunburst
Committee decided to instruct Lazard to counter Sonaca’s $14.00 per share proposal with a price of $15.00 per share. In addition, the Sunburst
Committee instructed Lazard to request removal of the reverse break-up fee and to offer employment agreements for Messrs. Korte and Stebe
only (with no associated closing condition) and calls with only two of the Company’s largest customers. A representative of management then
discussed the Company’s ongoing work to update management’s financial forecasts.

 
Shortly following the conclusion of the Sunburst Committee meeting on January 28, 2017, based on the instructions of the Sunburst

Committee, a representative of Lazard called Credit Suisse and indicated that the Company was only willing to proceed on the basis of a price
per share of at least $15.00 and on the other terms discussed by the Sunburst Committee.

 
The next morning, on January 29, 2017, the full Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of the Company

management team and representatives of Lazard and Gibson Dunn present, at which the Sunburst Committee briefed the other directors on the
Sunburst Committee’s decision to reject the $14.00 per share offer and counter at a price per share of $15.00. A representative of Lazard
reported that he had delivered this message to a representative of Credit Suisse, and had also communicated the Company’s position that the
reverse break-up fee concept must be deleted, that Mr. Korte and Mr. Stebe would agree to post-closing employment arrangements with Sonaca
but that there could be no associated closing condition or requirement for any other executive to enter into an employment agreement, and that
the Company would not facilitate more than two confirmatory customer calls. A representative of Gibson Dunn reviewed the fiduciary duties of
the Board in considering and responding to an acquisition proposal as well certain legal terms of Sonaca’s proposal and answered questions.
The Board of Directors also discussed its assessment of certain risks relating to certainty of closing a transaction with Sonaca.

On January 31, 2017, the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of Company management and representatives

of Lazard and Gibson Dunn present. The meeting began with a representative of Lazard reporting that he had not yet received a response from
Credit Suisse to the Company’s $15.00 counter-proposal delivered on January 28, 2017. Members of the Company management team and the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (which is comprised solely of independent directors) then updated the Board of Directors
on the Compensation Committee’s consideration, direction and oversight of various compensation matters relating to the potential transaction
with Sonaca, including the contemplated acceleration of equity awards and certain analyses being performed by the Compensation Committee’s
outside compensation consultant. Mr. Stebe updated the Board of Directors on preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year
ended December 31, 2016, which indicated an earnings shortfall and higher net debt balance relative to expectations. With respect to net debt,
Mr. Stebe informed the Board of Directors that preliminary results indicated an actual net debt balance of $240.8 million at December 31, 2016,
approximately $10 million higher than management’s expected net balance of $231.052 million that had been communicated to Sonaca on
November 24, 2016 together with the August 2016 Plan. Mr. Stebe also discussed the bridge from the August 2016 Plan to management’s
updated January 2017 Plan and to its Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan, which are defined and described further in the section of this proxy
statement captioned “—Management Projections,” noting adjustments made relative to the August 2016 Plan to account for market conditions,
rate changes, the Company’s 2017 budget and delays in implementation of the Company’s enterprise resource planning system. Discussion
ensued, addressing major drivers to sales and profit number reductions reflected in the updated forecasts, and Mr. Stebe answered questions.
The Board of Directors and the members of management present discussed at length these results and management’s rationale for the revised
forecasts, notably management’s belief that the Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan reflected its most up-to-date and balanced forecasts, reflecting
in particular completion of the 2017 budget, learnings from the Company’s preliminary 2016 full year financial results, anticipated reductions
in certain platform build rate outlooks, management changes, potential challenges in winning new opportunities and potential execution risks
on new programs that were not included in the August 2016 Plan and the January 2017 Plan. Representatives of Lazard then reviewed with the
Board of Directors certain preliminary valuation analyses and performance statistics of the Company and answered questions.

 
On February 2, 2017, a representative of Credit Suisse called Lazard to verbally indicate a final revised proposal with a value of

$14.50 per share of Company common stock.
 
That afternoon, on February 2, 2017, the Sunburst Committee convened a telephonic meeting, which was also attended by members of

Company management and representatives of Lazard and Gibson Dunn. A representative of Lazard began by updating the Sunburst Committee
on his conversation with Credit Suisse regarding Sonaca’s counter proposal of $14.50 per share. Credit Suisse had characterized the offer as
Sonaca’s absolute “best and final” offer and explained that Sonaca’s delay in responding had been due to its need to seek formal approvals from
its shareholders, all of which approvals had now been obtained according to Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse had also conveyed that Sonaca had
agreed to most of the other terms of the Company’s January 28 counter-proposal, namely that it would require only two confirmatory customer
calls, it had agreed to delete the concept of a reverse break-up fee as a limitation on the Company’s damages and to delete all other financing
contingency-like provisions from the draft

Merger Agreement, would request the delivery at signing of conditional employment agreements only with Messrs. Korte and Stebe with no
associated closing condition and would agree to a physical inspection of certain other due diligence items at a location specified by the
Company. The Sunburst Committee discussed Sonaca’s proposal and asked questions of Lazard, noting that the mathematical difference
between a purchase price of $15.00 versus $14.50 per share represented a relatively small percentage of enterprise and equity value and also a
small difference in EBITDA multiples. After further deliberation, the Sunburst Committee directed Lazard to communicate to Credit Suisse that
the Company would move forward with negotiating the definitive Merger Agreement on the basis of a $14.50 price per share, while
emphasizing that this price remained subject to approval of the full Board of Directors and that the Company continued to seek a longer, 35
calendar day “go-shop” period in lieu of Sonaca’s proposed 21 days. After a review of market data regarding break-up fees involving similarly
leveraged transactions presented by representatives of Lazard, and following a discussion with a representative of Gibson Dunn on the legal
implications of the break-up fee amount, the Sunburst Committee instructed Lazard to propose to Credit Suisse a single break-up fee of $7.5
million, equal to approximately 3.7% of equity value and 1.7% of enterprise value. The Sunburst Committee authorized Gibson Dunn to reflect
this proposal in its revised draft of the Merger Agreement.

 
On February 2, 2017, shortly following the telephonic meeting of the Sunburst Committee, Lazard called Credit Suisse to

communicate the Company’s desire to move forward on the basis of a value of $14.50 per share subject to successful negotiation of a mutually
acceptable Merger Agreement and final approval of the full Board of Directors. On this call, Lazard also communicated the Company’s
counter-proposal regarding certain terms of the Merger Agreement, including the length of the “go-shop” period and size of the break-up fee.

 
On the morning of February 3, 2017, Gibson Dunn sent to APKS a revised draft of the Merger Agreement reflecting the Company’s

previously articulated positions, including with respect to the length of the “go-shop” period and the amount of the break-up fee.
 
Later in the afternoon on February 3, 2017, the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting, with members of Company management

and representatives of Lazard and Gibson Dunn present. During the meeting, members of the Company management team reviewed with the
Board of Directors the content of management’s January 2017 Plan and Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan, incorporating the most current
market and Company operating performance data and management’s updated forecast for 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 financial performance
provided to the Board of Directors in advance of the meeting. The presentation reviewed certain assumptions of management underlying the
January 2017 Plan and Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan, as well as differences in the updated plans as compared to the August 2016 Plan that
had been previously approved by the Board of Directors in August 2016 and provided to Sonaca on November 24, 2016. Following discussion,
the Board of Directors approved the January 2017 Plan and Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan and authorized Lazard to provide both of these
forecasts, together with management’s update on preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016,
to Credit Suisse as soon as possible. The Board of Directors also formally instructed Lazard to rely on the Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan for
the purpose of rendering its Fairness Opinion to be presented to the Board of Directors at a subsequent meeting, based on its conclusion that the
Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan

represented the most realistic and appropriate basis for Lazard’s analysis. Representatives of Gibson Dunn then reviewed in detail the key terms
of the draft Merger Agreement, with a focus on the proposed deal protections and closing conditions. A discussion then ensued regarding the
course of negotiations of the deal protections, including the break-up fee, the go-shop and no-shop provisions in the draft Merger Agreement,
and the absence of a financing contingency. The Board of Directors asked questions about the extent of operating flexibility afforded by the
interim negative covenants and a discussion ensued.

 
On the evening of February 3, 2017 following the Board of Directors telephonic meeting, Lazard, on behalf of the Company, provided

to Sonaca and Credit Suisse an update on preliminary financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, which
indicated an earnings shortfall and higher net debt balance relative to expectations. Lazard also provided to Credit Suisse Company
management’s revised forecasts as reflected in the January 2017 Plan and Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan.

 
Also on February 3, 2017 and February 4, 2017, Messrs. Korte and Delvaux had further discussions regarding the terms of the

employment agreements expected to be executed by Messrs. Korte and Stebe concurrently with the execution of a definitive Merger
Agreement, which were being directed and overseen and would be subject to review and approval by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors (which is comprised solely of independent directors). Messrs. Korte and Delvaux also discussed procedures for the two
upcoming planned introductory calls with customers of the Company.

 
On February 5, 2017, Messrs. Korte and Stebe and representatives of Lazard held a conference call with members of Sonaca’s

management team and representatives of Credit Suisse to discuss the preliminary financial results of the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended
December 31, 2016 and the revised financial forecasts that had been provided to Credit Suisse on February 3, 2017.

 
On the morning of February 6, 2017, the Board of Directors convened a telephonic meeting with members of the Board of Directors,

members of Company management and representatives of Gibson Dunn. A representative of the management team updated the Board of
Directors on the conversation that had taken place the day before with Sonaca and Credit Suisse regarding the preliminary financial results of
the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and Company management’s revised financial forecasts. Following that
conversation, Sonaca had communicated both to Mr. Korte and via Credit Suisse to representatives of Lazard that Sonaca believed the updated
financial information (and in particular the higher than expected net debt balance) necessitated a decrease in Sonaca’s offer of between $0.75 to
$1.00 per share. A member of the management team also then informed the Board of Directors that the Company had received certain letters
from a major customer with respect to the Company’s performance under the contract with that customer, and provided information on the
Company’s recovery plan regarding such matters. The Board of Directors then reviewed with members of Company management and
representatives of Gibson Dunn certain share price projections that had been included in a presentation to the Company in August 2016 by a
financial advisor other than Lazard (and which other financial advisor was neither engaged by, involved in nor advising the Company or the
Board of Directors with respect to a potential transaction). The Board of Directors discussed and agreed that the assumptions on EBITDA and
net debt underlying such

9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 69/255

 

  
projections were invalid and, therefore, that the projections were not useful. Accordingly, the Board of Directors gave no weight to such
projections in its consideration of matters relating to a potential transaction with Sonaca. Representatives of Lazard joined the meeting and
recounted for the Board of Directors their conversations with Sonaca management and Credit Suisse, during which the Sonaca and Credit
Suisse representatives had reiterated that a $0.75 to $1.00 reduction in Sonaca’s offer price was likely forthcoming. After further discussion, the
Board of Directors, with the concurrence of Lazard, instructed the Company management team to present an overall business update to Sonaca
as soon as possible and prior to receiving a revised offer.

 
On February 8, 2017, members of the Company management team and representatives of Lazard held a conference call with members

of the Sonaca management team and representatives of Credit Suisse to discuss additional business updates, including various opportunities in
the Company’s business pipeline that were not reflected in the Company’s 2016 year-end financial results. While these potential opportunities
had generally been considered in formulating the Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan, they had not been identified in detail in the forecast. During
that call, a member of the Company management team also disclosed to the representatives of the Sonaca management team that certain
performance issues had recently been brought to the Company’s attention by one of its customers, but that such issues were already in the
process of being addressed and that, based on subsequent discussions with and new orders subsequently received from that same customer,
Company management believed that the ongoing customer relationship remained sound. The members of the Company management also
communicated their belief that the identified performance issues did not impact any of the financial forecasts that had been provided to Sonaca
and that the Company was willing to facilitate an introductory call with Sonaca and the relevant customer in addition to the two introductory
calls with other customers the Company had already agreed to facilitate.

 
Later on February 8, 2017, a representative of Credit Suisse called a representative of Lazard to verbally indicate a revised proposal

with a value of $13.75 per share, which represented a $0.75 reduction from the previously agreed-upon price of $14.50 per share. Credit Suisse
communicated that this revised value incorporated the preliminary 2016 fourth quarter financial results, Company management’s revised
financial forecasts and the Company’s higher-than-expected net debt balance.

 
The same afternoon, on February 8, 2017, the Sunburst Committee convened a telephonic meeting to consider Sonaca’s revised

proposal. Members of the Company management team and representatives of Lazard and Gibson Dunn were also present. After deliberation,
the Sunburst Committee instructed Lazard to counter Sonaca’s offer with a value of $14.25 per share.

 
Immediately after the Sunburst Committee meeting on February 8, 2017, a representative of Lazard called a representative of Credit

Suisse to counter Sonaca’s offer with a value of $14.25 per share of Company common stock.
 
On February 10, 2017, a representative of Credit Suisse called a representative of Lazard to verbally indicate a final revised proposal

with a value of $14.00 per share of Company common stock.

The same afternoon, on February 10, 2017, the Sunburst Committee convened a telephonic meeting, with members of the Company

management team and representatives of Lazard and Gibson Dunn present, to consider whether to move forward on the basis of Sonaca’s final
offer of $14.00 per share. After deliberation, during which the Sunburst Committee considered the fourth quarter 2016 financial results and the
letters from a major customer with respect to the Company’s performance under the contract with that customer, previously discussed by the
Board of Directors at the February 6, 2017 meeting of the Board of Directors, the Sunburst Committee instructed Lazard to communicate to
Credit Suisse that the Company would be willing to move forward on the basis of a $14.00 per share price, subject to successful negotiation of
a mutually acceptable Merger Agreement and final approval by the full Board of Directors. A representative of Lazard then called a
representative of Credit Suisse to communicate the Company’s interest in moving forward.

 
In the late afternoon on February 10, 2017, representatives of Gibson Dunn and APKS held a conference call to discuss open issues in

the revised draft of the Merger Agreement APKS was preparing to send to Gibson Dunn. Shortly after that call, APKS sent to Gibson Dunn a
revised draft of the Merger Agreement. Although this draft reflected a resolution of a number of issues in the agreement, some material open
issues remained, in particular the length of the go-shop period (Sonaca proposed 25 calendar days versus the Company’s desired 35 calendar
days), the amount of the break-up fee (Sonaca proposed $15.4 million versus the Company’s desired $7.5 million), certain of the interim
operating covenants and Sonaca’s proposed inclusion of an additional termination right for Sonaca based on an interim revenue test in the event
of certain adverse changes in relations with customers or suppliers.

 
On Saturday morning, February 11, 2017, Messrs. Korte and Delvaux held the first of three introductory calls with customers of the

Company. The second and third such calls were held on February 13, 2017 and February 15, 2017, respectively.
 
Also on February 11, 2017, representatives of Company management and representatives of Sonaca management, accompanied by

representatives of Lazard and Credit Suisse, held a telephone conference regarding certain aspects of Sonaca’s proposed financing structure for
the transaction.

 
On February 13, 2017, representatives of Gibson Dunn and APKS held an in-person negotiating session in New York City concerning

the Merger Agreement, during which additional issues were resolved but key remaining business issues, including the length of the go-shop
period, the outside date for satisfaction of closing conditions, an additional termination right for Sonaca based on an interim revenue test in the
event of certain adverse changes in relations with customers or suppliers, the amount of the break-up fee, and the scope of certain interim
operating covenants, were deferred to resolution among the business principals.

 
Also on February 13, 2017, Messrs. Korte and Delvaux discussed by telephone the post-closing compensation structure currently

contemplated for the Company leadership team following a transaction, which included base salary, bonus and long-term incentive structure
and severance. Messrs. Korte and Delvaux also discussed logistics for an upcoming customer introductory call.

On February 13, 2017 and February 14, 2017, the Sunburst Committee held telephonic status report meetings, with members of the
Company management team and representatives of Gibson Dunn present, to discuss the current status of open issues in the Merger Agreement
negotiations.

 
On February 14, 2017, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors convened a telephonic meeting to discuss

compensation and employee-related matters in the draft Merger Agreement, including the terms of Messrs. Korte’s and Stebe’s contemplated
post-closing employment arrangements, the treatment of long-term incentive plan awards under the Merger Agreement and various analyses by
the Compensation Committee’s external compensation consultant.

 
On February 14, 2017, Gibson Dunn sent to APKS a revised draft of the Merger Agreement, which proposed a compromise of 30

calendar days for the length of the go-shop period and also reflected the Company’s compromise proposal for a two-tiered break-up fee, which
would remain relatively lower ($7.5 million) if triggered by a termination (i) within the 30-day “go-shop” period in order to enter into a
superior proposal, or (ii) within 60 days after signing and relating to an acquisition proposal received during or as a result of the go-shop period,
but would be relatively higher ($11 million) if triggered by a termination under any other circumstance.

 
Later on February 14, 2017, representatives of Gibson Dunn and APKS discussed the latest revised draft of the Merger Agreement and

further narrowed the list of open issues, the resolution of which was deferred to an all-hands call including business principals scheduled for the
next day.

 
On February 15, 2017, members of the Company management team and Sonaca management teams, including Messrs. Korte and

Delvaux, along with representatives of Gibson Dunn and APKS, convened an all-hands telephone conference with the intent of resolving all
remaining open issues in the draft Merger Agreement. During this call, Sonaca agreed to a 30-day go-shop period, the Company agreed to a
final outside date of September 29, 2017, the business principals agreed on the scope of interim operating covenants, and, on the issue of the
break-up fee, Sonaca countered with a fee of $10 million if triggered by a termination within the first 60 days and relating to an acquisition
proposal received during or as a result of the go-shop period and $15 million otherwise. Members of the Sonaca management team indicated
they would consider withdrawing their request for the additional revenue test and termination right based on adverse changes in customer or
supplier relations as part of an overall resolution of issues.

 
Later that same afternoon, on February 15, 2017, the Board of Directors convened a telephonic meeting, with members of the

Company management team and representatives of Lazard and Gibson Dunn present. A representative of Gibson Dunn updated the Board of
Directors on the current status of negotiations regarding the Merger Agreement and material issues that had been resolved since the last Board
of Directors meeting, including the length of the go-shop period, as well as remaining open issues, including the amount of the break-up fee and
Sonaca’s proposed addition of a revenue test and termination right based on adverse changes in customer or supplier relations. The
representative of Gibson Dunn also reviewed with the

Board of Directors certain details of Sonaca’s equity and debt financing commitments based on Gibson Dunn’s recent review of such
documents and summarized Sonaca’s current proposal regarding the amount of the two-tiered break-up fee. The Board of Directors also
discussed with the representatives of Gibson Dunn and Lazard the perceived likelihood of a topping bid and how the proposed break-up fee
structure would be expected to affect the ability and willingness of a topping bidder to emerge. After further discussion, the Board of Directors
concluded it would be willing to accept Sonaca’s proposed break-up fee structure as part of a package resolution conditioned on the removal of
Sonaca’s additional termination right that had been introduced in the last draft circulated by APKS.

 
Later on February 15, 2017 and throughout the day on February 16, 2017, representatives of Gibson Dunn and APKS exchanged

multiple drafts of and negotiated the final open issues in the Merger Agreement, ultimately agreeing to the break-up fee construct Sonaca had
last proposed and the deletion of the additional termination right that had been requested by Sonaca and the related interim notice covenant and
revenue test.

 
Also on February 15-16, 2017, Messrs. Stebe and van Ockenburg exchanged e-mails and telephone calls to discuss certain technical

details in the Merger Agreement as well as the Company’s and Sonaca’s respective views on a communications plan for announcement of the
transaction once the Merger Agreement was executed, which was expected to occur sometime in the evening on February 16, 2017.

 
In the early evening on February 16, 2017, the Board of Directors held a telephonic meeting with members of Company management

and representatives of Gibson Dunn and Lazard present. A representative of Gibson Dunn reviewed with the Board of Directors its fiduciary
duties as well as the proposed final terms of the Merger Agreement and described the material changes to the Merger Agreement from the prior
version that had been presented to the Board of Directors. A member of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reported on
that committee’s independent evaluation of the compensation arrangements involved in the transaction, including the employment agreements
to be entered into by Messrs. Korte and Stebe and potentially Jay Inman, President, Engineering Services, Keith Schrader, Vice President,
Operations, and David Wright, Vice President, Corporate & Business Development. The Compensation Committee member explained that such
employment agreements would provide for an annual base salary, an initial bonus and certain cash incentive and performance bonuses, and that,
while this would amount to an overall increase in compensation for such executives compared to their current employment agreements with the
Company, the differences were not significant. Specifically, total annual compensation would increase at targeted levels if post-closing
operating performance objectives were met for these executives by an average of approximately 13%, ranging from a 21% increase for Mr.
Korte to 8.5% increases for Messrs. Inman and Schrader. The substantial portion of such increases would be in the form of performance-based
bonuses and long-term incentive awards (the payment of which would be contingent upon the post-closing operating performance of the
business), with no increase in base pay in the first year following the closing of the Merger contemplated for any of the executives except Mr.
Korte, whose base pay would increase by only 3%. The Compensation Committee member also reported that the committee’s outside
compensation consultant previously advised that the compensation levels under the proposed employment agreements would bring the
executives’ overall compensation from below-market levels closer to the market

norm. The Compensation Committee had specifically considered whether such compensation arrangements were of a nature or magnitude that
would have diverted value from the Company’s shareholders and determined they were not. Representatives of Lazard then reviewed their
financial analyses of the merger consideration. The Board of Directors discussed these financial analyses in detail and again reviewed the
reasons why the Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan was the most appropriate forecast for Lazard to use in its discounted cash flow analysis,
namely because the Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan incorporated management’s most current market and Company operating performance
data, and best accounted for the execution risk and challenges facing the Company. The Board of Directors also discussed the possibility that,
given uncertainties in the credit markets, rising interest rates and the Company’s recent earnings shortfall, the Company’s cost of capital in a
future refinancing could potentially be higher than originally forecasted and may have posed an additional risk to the Company’s operating
plan. Following this discussion, a representative of Lazard rendered to the Board of Directors Lazard’s oral opinion, which was subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated February 16, 2017, to the effect that, based upon and subject to the assumptions, procedures,
factors, qualifications and limitations set forth in its written opinion, as of February 16, 2017, the per share merger consideration to be paid to
the holders of Company common stock (other than excluded holders) in the Merger was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of
the Company common stock (other than excluded holders), as of the date of Lazard’s opinion. For a detailed discussion of Lazard’s opinion,
please see below under the caption “—Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC.” After further deliberation and discussion, each member of the
Board of Directors (other than Mr. Korte, who abstained out of an abundance of caution due to his current and prospective employment with the
Company, among other interests in the transaction) (i) authorized and approved the execution, delivery and performance of the Merger
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated thereby, (iii) declared that the terms of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including
the Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, were fair to and in the best interests of the
shareholders of the Company, (iv) directed that the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement be submitted to a vote at a meeting of the
shareholders of the Company and (v) recommended that the shareholders of the Company approve and adopt the Merger Agreement.

 
Later in the evening on February 16, 2017, several hours after the market close, the Company, Sonaca, Intermediate Co. and Sub

delivered signatures and entered into the Merger Agreement. The closing price per share of Company common stock on NASDAQ on
February 16, 2017 was $9.19.

 
The transaction was announced pursuant to a joint press release issued by the Company and Sonaca shortly after the Merger

Agreement was entered into on the evening of February 16, 2017. The press release disclosed the fact that the Company would be soliciting
alternative proposals as part of a go-shop process. The Company also separately announced in parallel its preliminary unaudited financial
results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Immediately following issuance of the press releases, Mr. Korte sent a
Company-wide email to all employees of the Company announcing the transaction.

Prior to the market open on February 17, 2017, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, which attached (and filed as

solicitation material under Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act) the Merger Agreement, forms of employment agreements to be entered into by
Messrs. Korte and Stebe at the closing of the Merger, the press releases, Mr. Korte’s email to employees and certain other communications
issued concurrently with the announcement of the transaction.

 
The “Go-Shop” Period
 
Beginning on February 17, 2017 representatives of Lazard reached out to representatives of 52 parties with likely strategic interest in

the Company and financial capability to complete an acquisition to invite such companies to consider the acquisition of the Company and to
provide a form confidentiality agreement in compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement to interested companies.

 
On February 20, 2017, Company A executed the form confidentiality agreement without proposing any changes to it.
 
On February 21, 2017, Lazard transmitted a process letter to Company A’s financial advisor and provided Company A and its financial

advisor with access to diligence materials via an online data room, including the January 2017 Plan, Risk-Adjusted 2017 Plan and the
Company’s 2016 full year financial update. On February 27, 2017, representatives of Lazard held a conference call with the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of Company A and representatives of Company A’s financial advisor to discuss Company A’s initial high-
level diligence questions.

 
On February 21, 2017, Company B provided minor comments to the form confidentiality agreement and, on February 23, 2017,

executed a confidentiality agreement with the Company (but dated February 21, 2017). On February 23, 2017, Lazard provided Company B
with access to the initial set of diligence materials via the online data room, including the January 2017 Plan, Risk-Adjusted 2017 Plan and the
Company’s 2016 full year financial update.

 
On February 21, 2017, Company C reached out to the Company and Lazard to express its potential interest in participating in the go-

shop process (although it was not one of the 52 parties initially contacted by Lazard). In a subsequent call with a representative of Lazard on
February 22, 2017, however, Company C indicated it was reluctant to sign a confidentiality agreement containing a standstill provision, as
required by the terms of the Merger Agreement. On February 28, 2017, Company C sent a markup of the form confidentiality agreement that
deleted the standstill provision and proposed other edits to make the confidentiality provisions less restrictive.

 
On March 1, 2017, the Board of Directors convened a telephonic meeting, with members of management and representatives of

Lazard and Gibson Dunn present. Lazard presented an update on the status of the go-shop process and discussed with the Board of Directors
Company C’s indication that it would not sign a confidentiality agreement containing a standstill provision as required by the terms of the
Merger Agreement. The Board of Directors and Lazard discussed their respective assessments of Company C’s level of interest and capacity to
consummate an

acquisition. Based on their experience and knowledge of Company C’s size, reputation, and investment history, the Board of Directors and
Lazard considered it improbable that Company C would be able to make a viable topping bid. Following that discussion, the Board of Directors
determined at that time not to seek a waiver from Sonaca or take any other special action with respect to Company C. Instead, the Board of
Directors determined to focus the Company’s and its advisors’ resources on filing the Company’s preliminary proxy statement prior to the end
of the go-shop period in order to make available to Company C, without the need for a confidentiality agreement, the same financial projections
that had been provided to Companies A and B and which are described in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Management
Projections.”

 
On March 6, 2017, representatives of Company A informed representatives of Lazard that Company A had determined not to proceed

with an acquisition of the Company, indicating that it could not exceed Sonaca’s valuation of $14.00 per share.
 
Also on March 6, 2017, representatives of Company B informed representatives of Lazard that Company B had determined not to

proceed with an acquisition of the Company.
 
On the morning of March 15, 2017, the Company filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC, three full business days before the

expiration of the go-shop period. A representative of Lazard alerted Company C that the filing had been made in order to facilitate Company
C’s evaluation of the financial projections disclosed.

 
At 11:59 p.m., New York time, on March 18, 2017, the “go-shop” period ended with the Company not having received any alternative

acquisition proposals, including from Company C.
 
On March 20, 2017, after the go-shop period end date, a representative of Company C left a Lazard representative a message

indicating that Company C would not be making a bid.
 
Other than Company A and Company B, none of the other 52 parties contacted showed any meaningful interest in a potential

transaction with the Company.
 

Recommendation of the Board of Directors and Reasons for the Merger
 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors
 

The Board of Directors, other than Daniel G. Korte, a member of the Board of Directors and the Company’s President and Chief
Executive Officer, who abstained from voting due to his interests in the transaction as described in the section of the proxy statement captioned
“The Merger—Interests of LMI’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” has unanimously: (1) determined that the Merger Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of LMI and its
shareholders; and (2) adopted and approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

 
The Board of Directors, with Mr. Korte abstaining, unanimously recommends that you vote: (1) “FOR” the adoption the Merger

Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby; (2) “FOR” the proposal to adjourn the Special
Meeting, if

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 76/255

 
 

necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting; and (3) “FOR” the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve
certain compensation that will or may become payable to LMI’s named executive officers in connection with the Merger.

 
Reasons for the Merger
 

In evaluating the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Board of
Directors consulted with LMI management, and representatives of its financial advisor and outside legal counsel. In recommending that
shareholders vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby,
the Board of Directors considered a number of factors, including the following (which factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative
importance):

 
● the fact that the all-cash Merger Consideration will provide certainty of value and liquidity to shareholders, while eliminating the

effect of long-term business and execution risk to shareholders.
 

● the relationship of the $14.00 Merger Consideration to the trading price of our common stock, including that the Merger
Consideration constituted a premium of approximately (i) 52% over LMI’s closing share price on February 16, 2017, the last
trading day prior to the date the Merger Agreement was publicly announced, (ii) 63% over LMI’s three-month volume weighted
average price up to and including February 16, 2017, and (iii) 78% over LMI’s six-month volume weighted average price up to
and including February 16, 2017.

 
● the current and historical market prices of the common stock, including the market performance of the common stock relative to

those of other participants in the Company’s industry and general market industries.
 

● the advantages of entering into the Merger Agreement in comparison with the risks of remaining independent, including risks to
achieving projected 2017 performance and long-term financial projections as a standalone company, the risks inherent in LMI’s
industry, potential changes in laws and regulations affecting the industry, the economy and capital markets as a whole, and the
various additional risks and uncertainties that are listed in Item 1A of Part I or Part II, as applicable, of our most recent annual and
quarterly reports.

 
● the potential challenges the Company could face in refinancing its debt at desirable rates given the Company’s net debt level at the

end of fiscal year 2016, which was higher than had been forecasted, the rising interest rate environment, and the Company’s lower
than expected fourth quarter earnings in 2016.

 
● its belief, based on discussions and negotiations with Sonaca, that the $14.00 per share was the highest price Sonaca would be

willing to pay.

● the oral opinion of Lazard, subsequently confirmed in writing, delivered to the Board of Directors that, as of February 16, 2017
and based upon and subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications and limitations set forth in its opinion, the per
share Merger Consideration to be paid to holders of the Company common stock (other than excluded holders) in the Merger was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders of Company common stock (other than excluded holders), as more fully
described below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “—Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC.”

 
● there were extensive arm’s length negotiations with Sonaca, which, among other things, resulted in an increase in the offered

merger consideration from a value range of $11.00 to $12.50 per share to $14.00 per share.
 

● the likelihood that the Merger will be consummated, based on, among other things, the limited number of conditions to the
Merger, the absence of a financing condition, Parent’s representation that it will have sufficient financial resources to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration and consummate the Merger, the Board of Directors’ and management’s assessment, after
discussion with Lazard and Gibson Dunn and review of the relevant debt and equity financing commitment letters, that the Parent
has the financial capability to complete the Merger, the relative likelihood of obtaining required regulatory approvals, and the
remedies available under the Merger Agreement to LMI in the event of a breach by Parent.

 
● the terms of the Merger Agreement and the related agreements, including LMI’s ability (i) to solicit alternative acquisition

proposals through March 18, 2017 and (ii) to thereafter consider and respond to, under certain circumstances specified in the
Merger Agreement, a bona fide acquisition proposal, and the Board of Director’s right, after complying with the terms of the
Merger Agreement, to terminate the Merger Agreement in order to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal
upon payment of either $10 million or $15 million, depending upon the circumstances. For more information, see the section of
this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—Break-Up Fees.”

 
● the Merger would be subject to the approval of LMI shareholders holding at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of common

stock as of the Record Date, and the shareholders would be free to reject the Merger.
 

● the availability of appraisal rights and payment of fair value under Missouri law to registered holders of shares of common stock,
and beneficial owners of shares of common stock whose nominees follow the required statutory procedures, who timely file a
written objection to the Merger Agreement, do not vote in favor of the proposal to approve the Merger Agreement and comply
with all of the required procedures under Missouri law, which provides those eligible shareholders with an opportunity to have a
Missouri court determine the fair value of their shares, which may be more than, less than, or the same as the amount such
shareholders would have received under the Merger Agreement.

● the Board of Director’s view that the Merger Agreement was the product of an arm’s-length negotiations and contained customary
terms and conditions.

 
● the timing of the Merger and the risk that if we did not accept Parent’s offer at the time it was made, we might not have had

another opportunity to do so, particularly if the markets for private and public debt and private equity fluctuated in a manner that
made it more difficult to finance the acquisition.

 
● the Board of Director’s understanding of the Company’s business, assets, financial condition and results of operation, its

competitive position and historical and projected performance, and the nature of the industry and regulatory environment in which
the Company competes.

 
The Board of Directors also considered a number of uncertainties and risks concerning the Merger, including the following (which

factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):
 
● the fact that the announcement and pendency of the Merger, or the risks and costs to LMI if the Merger does not close, could

result in the diversion of management and employee attention, and potentially have a negative effect on our business and
relationships with customers and suppliers.

 
● the effect of a public announcement of the Company entering into the Merger Agreement on the Company’s operations, stock

price and employees and its ability to attract and retain key management and personnel while the Merger is pending.
 

● the fact that shareholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth of LMI and will not benefit from any appreciation
in value of LMI, including any appreciation in value that could be realized as a result of improvements to our operations.

 
● the possibility that Parent will be unable to obtain all or a portion of the financing for the Merger and related transactions,

including the debt financing proceeds contemplated by the debt commitment letter it received from the initial lenders.
 

● the requirement that LMI may be required to pay Parent a break-up of either $10 million or $15 million, depending upon the
circumstances for termination. For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement—
Break-Up Fees.”

 
● the restrictions on the conduct of LMI’s business prior to the consummation of the Merger, including the requirement that we

conduct our business in the ordinary course, subject to specific limitations, which may delay or prevent LMI from undertaking
business opportunities that may arise before the completion of the Merger and that, absent the Merger Agreement, LMI might
have pursued.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 79/255

 
 

● the fact that an all cash transaction would be taxable to LMI’s shareholders that are U.S. persons for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

 
● the fact that under the terms of the Merger Agreement, LMI is unable to solicit other acquisition proposals following the

expiration of the go-shop period.
 

● the risk that, while the Merger is expected to be completed, there can be no assurance that all conditions to the parties’ obligations
to complete the Merger will be satisfied, and as a result, it is possible that the Merger may not be completed even if approved by
our shareholders.

 
● the significant costs involved in connection with entering into the Merger Agreement and completing the Merger and the

substantial time and effort of LMI management required to complete the Merger, which may disrupt our business operations.
 

● the fact that LMI’s business, sales operations and financial results could suffer in the event that the Merger is not consummated.
 

● the risk that the Merger might not be completed and the effect of the resulting public announcement of termination of the Merger
Agreement on the trading price of our common stock.

 
● the fact that the completion of the Merger will require antitrust and other regulatory approvals in the United States.

 
In addition, our Board of Directors was aware of and considered the interests that certain of our directors and officers may have in the

Merger that differ from, or are in addition to, those of LMI’s other shareholders (see below in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger—Interests of LMI’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger”).

 
The foregoing discussion is not meant to be an exhaustive, but summarizes many, if not all, of the material factors considered by the

Board of Directors in its consideration of the Merger. After considering these and other factors, the Board of Directors concluded that the
potential benefits of the Merger outweighed the uncertainties and the risks. In view of the variety of factors considered by the Board of
Directors and the complexity of these factors, the Board of Directors did not find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise assign
relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching its determination and recommendations. Moreover, each member of the Board of Directors
applied his or her own personal business judgment to the process and may have assigned different weights to different factors. The Board of
Directors, other than Daniel G. Korte, a member of the Board of Directors and the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, who
abstained from voting due to his interests in the transaction as described in the section of the proxy statement captioned “The Merger—Interests
of LMI’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger,” unanimously adopted the Merger Agreement and approved the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and recommends that the shareholders adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby based upon the totality of the information presented to and considered by the Board of
Directors.

Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co. LLC
 

The Company retained Lazard to act as financial advisor to the Company and to render an opinion to our Board of Directors as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Company common stock (other than excluded holders) of the consideration to be paid to
such holders in the Merger. On February 16, 2017, Lazard rendered its oral opinion to our Board of Directors, subsequently confirmed in
writing, that, as of such date, and based upon and subject to the assumptions, procedures, factors, qualifications and limitations set forth therein,
the per share Merger Consideration to be paid to holders of Company common stock (other than (i) shares of Company common stock directly
owned by the Company as treasury stock or directly owned by Sonaca, Intermediate Co, or Sub and (ii) excluded holders) in the Merger was
fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders.

 
The full text of Lazard’s written opinion, dated February 16, 2017, which sets forth the assumptions made, procedures

followed, factors considered, and qualifications and limitations on the review undertaken by Lazard in connection with its opinion is
attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. The description of Lazard’s
opinion set forth in this proxy statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of Lazard’s written opinion attached as
Annex B. We encourage you to read Lazard’s opinion and this section carefully and in their entirety.

 
Lazard’s opinion was directed to our Board of Directors for the information and assistance of the Board of Directors in

connection with its evaluation of the Merger and only addressed the fairness, from a financial point of view, to holders of Company
common stock (other than excluded holders) of the per share Merger Consideration to be paid to such holders in the Merger as of the
date of Lazard’s opinion. The Company did not request Lazard to consider, and Lazard’s opinion did not address, the relative merits of
the Merger as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which the Company might engage or the merits of the
underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Merger. Lazard’s opinion was not intended to and does not constitute a
recommendation to any holder of Company common stock as to how such holder should vote or act with respect to the Merger or any
matter relating thereto. Lazard’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on,
and the information made available to Lazard as of, the date of Lazard’s opinion. Lazard assumed no responsibility for updating or
revising its opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the date of Lazard’s opinion. Lazard’s opinion did not express
any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Company common stock may trade at any time subsequent to the announcement of the
Merger.

 
The following is a summary of Lazard’s opinion. We encourage you to read Lazard’s written opinion carefully in its entirety.
 
 In connection with its opinion, Lazard: 
 

   
 ● reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated February 16, 2017 of the Merger Agreement; 
 

69



9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

 ● reviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to the Company;

 
 ● reviewed various financial forecasts and other data provided to Lazard by the Company relating to the business of the

Company, including the forecasts identified to Lazard as the Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan, as defined in the section of
this proxy statement entitled “—Background of the Merger”;

Company;
 

 ● reviewed public information with respect to certain other companies in lines of business Lazard believed to be generally
relevant in evaluating the business of the Company;
 

 ● reviewed the financial terms of certain business combinations involving companies in lines of business Lazard believed to be
generally relevant in evaluating the business of the Company;

Lazard assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing information, without independent verification of such

information. Lazard did not conduct any independent valuation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of the
Company or concerning the solvency or fair value of the Company, and Lazard was not furnished with any such valuation or appraisal. The
management of the Company advised Lazard that the Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan reflected the best currently available estimates and
judgments as to the future financial performance of the Company and, accordingly, at the direction of our Board of Directors, Lazard utilized
such forecasts for purposes of its financial analyses in connection with its opinion. With respect to the financial forecasts Lazard utilized in its
analyses, Lazard assumed, with the consent of the Company, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available
estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance of the Company. Lazard assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as
to such forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based.

 
In connection with its engagement, as of the date of its opinion Lazard was not authorized to, and Lazard did not, solicit indications of

interest from third parties regarding a potential transaction with the Company.
 
In rendering its opinion, Lazard assumed, with the consent of the Company, that the Merger would be consummated on the terms

described in the Merger Agreement, without any waiver or modification of any material terms or conditions of the Merger Agreement.
Representatives of the Company advised Lazard, and Lazard assumed, that the Merger

Agreement, when executed, would conform to the draft reviewed by Lazard in all material respects. Lazard also assumed, with the consent of
the Company, that obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals and consents for the Merger would not have an
adverse effect on the Company, or the Merger. Lazard’s opinion did not address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which
Lazard understood that the Company obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. Lazard expressed no view or
opinion as to any terms or other aspects (other than the per share Merger Consideration to the extent expressly specified in Lazard’s opinion) of
the Merger, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the Merger or any agreements or arrangements entered into in connection
with, or contemplated by, the Merger. In addition, Lazard expressed no view or opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any
other aspects relating to, the compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Merger, or class of such persons, relative
to the per share Merger Consideration or otherwise.

 
Summary of Lazard’s Financial Analyses
 

The following is a brief summary of the material financial analyses and reviews that Lazard deemed appropriate in connection with
rendering its opinion. The brief summary of Lazard’s analyses and reviews provided below is not a complete description of the analyses and
reviews underlying Lazard’s opinion. The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process involving various determinations as to the
most appropriate and relevant methods of analysis and review and the application of those methods to particular circumstances, and, therefore,
is not readily susceptible to summary description. Considering selected portions of the analyses and reviews or the summary set forth below,
without considering the analyses and reviews as a whole, could create an incomplete or misleading view of the analyses and reviews underlying
Lazard’s opinion.

 
In arriving at its opinion, Lazard considered the results of all of its analyses and reviews and did not attribute any particular weight to

any factor, analysis or review considered by it; rather, Lazard made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and
professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses and reviews.

 
 For purposes of its analyses and reviews, Lazard considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial

conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. No company, business or transaction used in Lazard’s
analyses and reviews as a comparison is identical to the Company or the Merger, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses and reviews
is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses and reviews involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and
operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the acquisition, public trading or other values of the companies, businesses or
transactions used in Lazard’s analyses and reviews. The estimates contained in Lazard’s analyses and reviews and the ranges of valuations
resulting from any particular analysis or review are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which
may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by Lazard’s analyses and reviews. In addition, analyses and reviews relating to
the value of companies, businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which companies, businesses or
securities actually may be sold. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Lazard’s analyses and reviews are inherently

subject to substantial uncertainty. The Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan that Lazard was directed by the Board of Directors to use in its analysis
reflected the financial forecast of the Company on a stand-alone basis and, accordingly, any potential synergies resulting from a combination of
the Company and Sonaca were not incorporated into that plan.

 
The summary of the analyses and reviews provided below includes information presented in tabular format. In order to fully

understand Lazard’s analyses and reviews, the tables must be read together with the full text of each summary. The tables alone do not
constitute a complete description of Lazard’s analyses and reviews. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the
full description of the analyses and reviews, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses and reviews, could
create a misleading or incomplete view of Lazard’s analyses and reviews.

 
Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on

market data as it existed on or before February 16, 2017 and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.
 

Financial Analyses
 

Selected Comparable Company Multiples Analysis.
 
Lazard reviewed and analyzed certain financial information, valuation multiples and market trading data related to selected

comparable publicly-traded aerospace manufacturing companies whose operations Lazard believed, based on its experience with companies in
the aerospace manufacturing industry, to be similar to the Company’s operations for purposes of this analysis. Lazard then compared such
information to the corresponding information for the Company.

 
The selected group of companies used in this analysis, which we refer to in this proxy statement as the “LMI comparable companies,”

was as follows:
 

●          Ducommun Inc.
 
●          Héroux-Devtek, Inc.
 
●          Senior plc
 
●          Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc.
 
●          Triumph Group, Inc.
 
●          Magellan Aerospace Corp.
 
●          GKN plc
 

Lazard selected the companies reviewed in this analysis because, among other things, the LMI comparable companies operate
businesses similar to the business of the Company. However, no selected company is identical to the Company. Accordingly, Lazard believes
that

 

72



9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 84/255

 
 

purely quantitative analyses are not, in isolation, determinative in the context of the Merger and that qualitative judgments concerning
differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and prospects of the Company and the LMI comparable companies that
could affect the public trading values of each are relevant.

 
Lazard calculated and compared the ratio of each company’s enterprise value, calculated as the market capitalization of each company

(based on its closing share price as of February 15, 2017 and most recently publicly reported fully-diluted share count), plus debt, less cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities (based on the most recent publicly available data) to its calendar year 2016, 2017 and 2018
estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, commonly and herein referred to as “EBITDA.” The EBITDA
estimates for each of the LMI comparable companies used by Lazard in its analysis were based on FactSet consensus estimates, except that the
calendar year 2016 information for Spirit Aerospace Holdings, Inc., Triumph Group, Inc. and Héroux-Devtek, Inc. was based on actual reported
data. The following table summarizes the results of this review:

 
LMI Comparable Companies Multiples

    
 Enterprise Value to 

2016E EBITDA

GKN plc 6.9x 6.2x 5.9x

 
(1)  Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc., Triumph Group, Inc. and Héroux-Devtek, Inc. CY2016 EBITDA figures represent actuals.
 
Based on an analysis of the relevant metrics for each of the LMI comparable companies. Lazard selected reference ranges of 7.0x to

8.5x for enterprise value to estimated 2016 EBITDA, 6.5x to 8.0x for enterprise value to estimated 2017 EBITDA and 6.0x to 7.5x for
enterprise value to estimated 2018 EBITDA.

 
Lazard applied such range of enterprise values to EBITDA multiples for the LMI comparable companies to the estimated Adjusted

EBITDA of the Company for 2016, 2017 and 2018 as reflected in the Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan, as described in the section of this
proxy statement captioned “—Management Projections.”

From this analysis, Lazard estimated implied price per share ranges for shares of the Company common stock as set forth below and as

compared to the per share merger consideration of $14.00 provided in the Merger Agreement:
 

 Implied Price Per Share Range
Enterprise Value/ 2016 EBITDA $2.59 - $6.93
Enterprise Value/ 2017 EBITDA $2.38 - $7.00
Enterprise Value/ 2018 EBITDA $2.45 - $7.48

 
Selected Precedent Transactions Multiples Analysis.
 
Lazard performed a selected precedent transactions analysis of the Company by reviewing publicly available financial information of

the following selected transactions involving target companies in the aerospace manufacturing industry that it viewed as comparable to the
Company. In performing this analysis, Lazard reviewed certain financial information and transaction multiples relating to the companies
involved in the selected transactions and compared such information to the corresponding information for the Company. Specifically, Lazard
reviewed eight merger and acquisition transactions announced since March 2010 involving companies in the aerospace manufacturing industry
for which sufficient public information was available.

 
The selected group of transactions used in this analysis were as follows:
 

Aerospace Manufacturing
 

Announcement Date Acquiror Target
   

July 2015 GKN plc Fokker Technologies Group B.V.
   

August 2013 Triumph Group, Inc. General Donlee Canada Inc.
   

March 2013 Greenbriar Equity Group LLC EDAC Technologies Corp.
   

October 2010 B/E Aerospace, Inc. TSI Group, Inc.
   

March 2010 Triumph Group, Inc. Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 86/255

 
 
To the extent publicly available, with respect to each company, Lazard calculated, among other things, the enterprise value of each

target company implied by the selected transactions by applying the enterprise value implied by the acquisition price to the relevant target
company’s estimated EBITDA for the latest twelve-month period prior to the date the acquisition was announced, or EV/LTM EBITDA. The
results of this analysis are summarized below:

 
Acquiror Target EV/LTM EBITDA
 
Aerospace Manufacturing
 
GKN plc Fokker Technologies Group B.V. 9.3x
   
Triumph Group, Inc. General Donlee Canada Inc. 12.4x
   
Greenbriar Equity Group LLC EDAC Technologies Corp. 10.4x
   
B/E Aerospace, Inc. TSI Group, Inc. 9.5x
   
Triumph Group, Inc. Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc. 6.1x
   
Vertically Integrated Aerospace Manufacturing
 
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Precision Castparts Corp. 13.0x
   
Alcoa Inc. RTI International Metals, Inc. 12.1x
   
Allegheny Technologies
Incorporated

Ladish Co., Inc. 14.8x

 
Based on the results of the foregoing analysis and Lazard’s professional judgment, Lazard applied EV/LTM EBITDA multiples

ranging from 9.5x to 11.5x to the Company’s estimated Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2016 (as reflected
in the Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan) and derived a reference range of implied equity values per share of the Company common stock of
$9.82 to $15.61.

 
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis - Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan.
 

Lazard performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company, which is a valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of a company
by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows of the Company. “Future cash flows” refers to projected unlevered
 

75



9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 87/255

 
 
free cash flows of a company. Unlevered free cash flow is defined as income from operations, less taxes, change in working capital, capital
expenditures, plus depreciation and amortization. Lazard calculated the discounted cash flow value for the Company as the sum of the net
present value of each of:
 

● the estimated future cash flows that the Company is expected to generate for each of years 2017 through 2020;
 

● the estimated value of the Company at the end of 2020, or the terminal value; and
 

● the estimated amounts of utilized net operating loss carry-forwards of the Company for each of years 2017 through 2020.
 

The estimated future cash flow was derived from data provided by the Company under the Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan, as the
Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan did not itself provide an explicit calculation of unlevered free cash flows. The following table sets forth the
estimated unlevered free cash flow for each of years 2017 through 2020 (in millions) which were calculated without adjustment for the
estimated amount of utilized net operating loss carry-forwards of the Company for the periods presented:

 
Fiscal Year Ending December 31,

(dollars in millions)

 
 2017E 2018E 2019E 2020E
Income From Operations $23.4 $26.1 $32.9 $41.2
Less:  Statutory Tax Rate (35%) (8.2) (9.1) (11.5) (14.4)
Net Income from Operations After Taxes $15.2 $17.0 $21.4 $26.8
Plus:  Depreciation & Amortization 18.5 19.6 19.5 20.7
Less:  Working Capital (Increase)/Decrease (1.7) (10.9) 1.2 6.5
Less:  Capital Expenditures (20.9) (20.5) (15.0) (14.3)
Unlevered Free Cash Flow $11.2 $5.2 $27.0 $39.8

 
For its discounted cash flow calculations, Lazard applied discount rates ranging from 8.25% to 9.25%. Such discount rates were based

on Lazard’s judgment of the estimated range of the Company’s weighted average cost of capital. Lazard estimated the weighted average cost of
capital for the Company derived from a number of factors using the capital asset pricing model and taking into account certain key inputs,
including, among others, the applicable risk free rate of return, the unlevered risk profile of LMI and LMI’s selected group of comparable
companies as set forth above in “—Selected Comparable Company Multiples Analysis,” an estimated range of LMI’s after-tax cost of long-term
debt, and an estimated range of LMI’s projected consolidated leverage ratio.

 
The terminal value of the Company was calculated by applying various exit EBITDA multiples ranging from 7.00x to 8.50x, which

were selected by Lazard by reference to enterprise value to 2016 EBITDA multiples calculated for the LMI comparable companies using
Lazard’s

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 88/255

 
 

professional judgment and experience, including with respect to the comparability of the LMI comparable companies.
 
The estimated amounts of net operating loss carry-forwards utilized by the Company were calculated based on the Risk-Adjusted

January 2017 Plan. Net operating loss carry-forwards were not considered in Lazard’s analyses other than its discounted cash flow analysis of
the Company, because the other analyses were based on Adjusted EBITDA, which is a pre-tax metric to which net operating loss carry-
forwards were not relevant.

 
Lazard derived the high and low prices per share implied by these calculations and compared them to the per share Merger

Consideration provided in the Merger Agreement as set forth below:
 

Implied Price Per Share Range Merger Consideration
  

$12.40 - $18.85 $14.00
 
Other Analyses and Reviews
 

The analyses and data described below were presented to our Board of Directors for reference purposes only and did not provide the
basis for, and were not material to, the rendering of Lazard’s opinion.

 
Discounted Cash Flow Analysis - January 2017 Plan.
 
Utilizing the January 2017 Plan, Lazard performed a discounted cash flow analysis to calculate a range of implied equity values for the

Company using the same procedures and methodologies summarized above under “—Financial Analyses - Discounted Cash Flow Analysis -
Risk Adjusted January 2017 Plan.” From this analysis, Lazard estimated an implied price per share range for shares of the Company common
stock, as compared to the per share merger consideration provided in the Merger Agreement as set forth below:

 
Implied Price Per Share Range Merger Consideration

  
$16.68 - $24.21 $14.00

 
The management of the Company advised Lazard that the Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan reflected the best currently available

estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance of the Company and, accordingly, at the direction of our Board of Directors,
Lazard utilized such forecasts for purposes of its financial analyses in connection with its opinion. As a result, the discounted cash flow analysis
utilizing the January 2017 Plan did not provide the basis for, and was not material to, the rendering of Lazard’s opinion.

 
52-Week High/Low Trading Prices.
 
Lazard reviewed the range of trading prices of shares of the Company common stock for the 52 weeks ended on February 15, 2017.

Lazard observed that, during such period, the intraday

share price of Company common stock ranged from $7.01 per share to $9.71 per share, as compared to the per share merger consideration of
$14.00 per share.

 
Research Analyst Price Targets.
 
Lazard reviewed and selected equity research analyst projected 12-month price targets for the Company common stock based on

published, publicly available Wall Street equity research reports. Lazard observed that such price targets ranged from $10.00 per share to
$11.50 per share, as compared to the per share merger consideration of $14.00 per share.

 
Miscellaneous
 

In connection with Lazard’s services as the Company’s financial advisor, the Company agreed to pay Lazard an aggregate estimated
fee of approximately $6.7 million, $1.5 million of which was payable upon the delivery of Lazard’s opinion and the remainder of which is
contingent upon the consummation of the Merger. The Company also agreed to reimburse Lazard for certain expenses incurred in connection
with Lazard’s engagement and to indemnify Lazard and certain related persons under certain circumstances against certain liabilities that may
arise from or relate to Lazard’s engagement, including certain liabilities under U.S. federal securities laws.

 
Lazard, as part of its investment banking business, is continually engaged in the valuation of businesses and their securities in

connection with mergers and acquisitions, negotiated underwritings, secondary distributions of listed and unlisted securities, private
placements, leveraged buyouts, and valuations for estate, corporate and other purposes. In the past two years, Lazard has provided certain
financial advisory services to Société Régionale d’Investissement de Wallonie, an affiliate of Parent, for which Lazard received approximately
$150,000. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Lazard and its affiliates and employees may trade securities of the Company and
certain affiliates of the Company and Parent for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers, may at any time hold a long or short
position in such securities and may also trade and hold securities on behalf of the Company, Parent and certain of their respective affiliates. The
issuance of this opinion was approved by the Opinion Committee of Lazard.

 
Lazard is an internationally recognized investment banking firm providing a full range of financial advisory and other services. Lazard

was selected to act as investment banker to the Company because of its qualifications, expertise and reputation in investment banking and
mergers and acquisitions, as well as its familiarity with the business of the Company. In the past two years, aside from services in connection
with the Merger, the financial advisory business of Lazard has not provided any services to the Company.

 
The Company and Parent determined the per share Merger Consideration to be paid to the holders of Company common stock in the

Merger through arm’s-length negotiations, and our Board of Directors approved the per share Merger Consideration. Lazard conducted the
analyses and reviews summarized above for the purpose of providing an opinion to our Board of Directors as to the fairness, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of Company common stock (other than excluded holders) of the per share Merger Consideration to be paid to such
holders in

the Merger. Lazard did not recommend any specific consideration to our Board of Directors or any other person or indicate that any given
consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the Merger.

 
Lazard’s opinion was one of many factors considered by our Board of Directors. Consequently, the summary of the analyses and

reviews provided above should not be viewed as determinative of the opinion of our Board of Directors with respect to the per share Merger
Consideration or of whether our Board of Directors would have been willing to recommend a different transaction or determine that a different
per share Merger Consideration was fair. Additionally, Lazard’s opinion is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any employee or
creditor of the Company.

 
Management Projections
 

In connection with Mr. Korte’s appointment as Chief Executive Officer of LMI effective March 8, 2014, the Company suspended
providing financial projections publicly to shareholders in order to give Mr. Korte adequate time to conduct a thorough review of the
Company’s financial projections and operations. In March 2015, as part of announcing the Company’s quarterly financial results, the Company
recommenced publicly providing annual financial outlook and guidance for the upcoming fiscal year to its investors. Additionally, in May
2016, in connection with the Company’s quarterly earnings call, the Company provided an investor presentation titled “Pathway to Equity
Growth” which specified high level financial outlook targets for fiscal year 2018. The presentation was also publicly presented by the Company
on various other occasions through November 2016. In connection with preparing this financial outlook and guidance for the upcoming fiscal
year and the high-level financial outlook targets for fiscal year 2018 and to assist the Board of Directors in evaluating ordinary course strategic
decisions at the August 2016 Board of Directors Meeting, the Company’s management prepared and the Board of Directors reviewed a set of
forecasts (the “August 2016 Plan”). In January 2017, at the request of the Board of Directors, Company management updated the August 2016
Plan in order to provide the Board of Directors with its current view of the future financial performance of the Company which incorporated the
most current market data, reflected changes in operations decisions and management, and updated operating performance data (the “January
2017 Plan”). Concurrently with the development of and in relation to the January 2017 Plan, and at the request of the Board of Directors,
Company management also prepared for the Board of Directors’ review a set of forecasts taking into account certain market and business risks,
including both internal execution risks and external market factors such as projected demand for certain aircraft (the “Risk-Adjusted January
2017 Plan”). The August 2016 Plan, the January 2017 Plan, and the Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) were made
available to Lazard for use in connection with its financial analyses and to Credit Suisse and Sonaca in connection with their due diligence
review of the Company.

 
The Board of Directors relied primarily on, and for purposes of its analysis and opinion directed Lazard to use, the Risk-Adjusted

January 2017 Plan, as the Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan reflected management’s most up-to-date and balanced forecasts. In particular, the
Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan were updated to reflect the completion of the 2017 budget, learnings from the Company’s preliminary 2016
full year financial results, the anticipated impact of reductions in certain platform build rate outlooks, management changes, potential
challenges in

winning new opportunities, and potential execution risks on new programs that were not included in the August 2016 Plan and January 2017
Plan.

 
Summaries of the Plans are provided below. In developing the Plans, the Company’s management made numerous judgments,

estimates and assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business, economic, regulatory, market and financial conditions and
other future events, as well as matters specific to the Company’s business, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond
the Company’s control. The Plans are subjective in many respects and are susceptible to multiple interpretations and periodic revisions based on
actual experience and business developments. As such, the Plans constitute forward-looking information and are subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results forecasted, including the various risks set forth in the

INDUSTRY CONDITIONS.

 
Use of Non-GAAP Measures
 

When viewed with our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP and accompanying reconciliations, we believe the non-
GAAP measures of “Adjusted EBITDA” and “Free Cash Flow” provide additional useful information to clarify and enhance the understanding
of the factors and trends affecting our past performance and future prospects. We define these measures, explain how they are calculated and
provide reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure in the tables below. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow,
as presented in this proxy statement, are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with,
GAAP. They are not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, or
any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as measures
of our liquidity. The presentation of these measures should not be interpreted to mean that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or
nonrecurring items.

 
The Company’s Board of Directors and executive management use Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and non-GAAP operating

performance measures internally as complementary financial measures to evaluate the performance and trends of our businesses. We present
Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow below because we believe that measures such as these provide useful information with respect to our
ability to meet our future debt service, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and overall operating performance.

 
Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as

substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:
 
● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, future expenditures for capital expenditures or contractual

commitments;
 

● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
 

● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments on our debt;

 
● Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be

replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;
 

● Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow do not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statement
of cash flows;

 

81



9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 93/255

 
 

● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact on earnings of charges resulting from matters unrelated to our ongoing operations;
and

 
● Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow differently, limiting their usefulness as

comparative measures.
 

You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and use Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow
only as a supplement to this information. See our consolidated financial statements contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-
K/A for the period ended December 31, 2016, and filed by the Company on April 4, 2017, which is incorporated by reference into this proxy
statement.

 
However, in spite of the above limitations, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are useful to an investor in

evaluating our results of operations because these measures:
 
● Are widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the

calculation of such terms, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book
value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors;

 
● Help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital

structure from our operating performance; and
 

● Are used by our management team for various other purposes in presentations to our Board of Directors as a basis for strategic
planning and forecasting.

 
Definitions of EBITDA and Free Cash Flow
 

Adjusted EBITDA, as used by the Company in this proxy statement, means net income (loss) plus (1) depreciation expense, (2)
amortization expense, (3) interest expense and certain one-time expenses, (4) income tax expense, and (5) stock based compensation. Examples
of one-time expenses included in the definition of Adjusted EBITDA may include costs associated with refinancing our debt and other
restructuring-related activities.

 
Free Cash Flow, as used by the Company in this proxy statement, means net cash provided by operating activities less cash used in

investing activities.

Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan (dollars in millions)

 Prepared by Company’s Management in January 2017
 

The following are revised forecasts prepared by the Company’s management in January 2017 to adjust the January 2017 Plan to
account for certain business risks, including a discount to Boeing 737 volumes from 2018 to 2020, a discount to revenues from new business
wins from 2018 to 2020, and a management reserve for potential execution risks on new programs. The Board of Directors relied primarily on,
and for purposes of its analysis and opinion directed Lazard to use, the Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan rather than the August 2016 Plan or
the January 2017 Plan, as the Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan reflected management’s most up-to-date and accurate forecasts.

 
 2017E 2018E 2019E 2020E
Total Revenue $380.4 $436.7 $486.8 $524.5
Gross Profit 69.7 76.9 88.0 96.1
Income From Operations 23.4 26.1 32.9 41.2
Adjusted EBITDA(1) 46.6 49.4 60.9 71.3
Free Cash Flow(2) 4.4 (0.4) 30.3 48.0
Net Tax Operating Loss Added/(Utilized) 4.1 5.3 (15.8) (27.0)

 
(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, which, as used by the Company, means earnings before, depreciation expense,

amortization expense, interest expense and certain one-time expenses, income tax expense, and stock-based compensation expense. The
Adjusted EBITDA used by Lazard for the purposes of its financial analyses described under the section of this proxy statement captioned
“—Opinion of Lazard Frères & Co, LLP” differs from the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA, as it subtracts the amount of annual stock
based compensation expense from the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA.

 
(2) Free Cash Flow is cash flow provided by the Company’s operating activities adjusted for cash used in investing activities.

Financing of the Merger
 

Consummation of the Merger is not subject to Parent’s ability to obtain financing; however, Parent expects to obtain financing for a
portion of the consideration to be paid in connection with the Merger.

 
Parent has obtained equity financing commitments from SFPI-FPIM in an amount up to €15 million, and from Wespavia SA in an

amount up to €85 million. Sonaca has also obtained debt financing commitments from the initial lenders (identified below under “—Debt
Financing”) pursuant to which Sonaca may borrow €50 million under a euro denominated term loan facility, $270 million under a U.S. dollar
denominated term loan facility, and up to €60 million euro (or certain other currencies) denominated revolving credit facility in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 
We believe that the amounts committed under the commitment letters will be sufficient to complete the Merger, but we cannot assure

you of that. Those amounts might be insufficient if, among other things, one or more of the parties to the commitment letters fails to fund the
financing or if the conditions to such commitments are not met, which conditions include the failure to receive the proceeds of the equity
financing, as described below. Although obtaining the proceeds of any financing, including financing under the commitment letters, is not a
contractual condition to the completion of the Merger, the failure of the Parent to obtain any portion of the committed financing (or alternative
financing) is likely to result in the failure of the Merger to be completed.

 
Equity Financing

Parent is party to equity commitment letters with two of its shareholders, SFPI-FPIM and Wespavia SA.
 
Pursuant to the equity commitment letter between Parent and SFPI-FPIM, dated January 27, 2017 and amended on February 16, 2017,

SFPI-FPIM committed to make an equity contribution to Parent, or to purchase on the closing date of the Merger equity securities of Parent, in
an aggregate amount of up to €15 million.

 
Pursuant to the equity commitment letter between Parent and Wespavia SA, dated February 16, 2017, Wespavia SA committed to

make an equity contribution to Parent, or to purchase on the closing date of the Merger equity securities of Parent, in an aggregate amount of up
to €85 million.

 
The equity commitment of SFPI-FPIM and Wespavia SA are each conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger following the

satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement. Furthermore, SFPI-FPIM’s and Wespavia SA’s funding of Parent’s debt financing must occur contemporaneously with, or
immediately prior to, the closing of the Merger and the issuance of equity securities of the Parent to SFPI-FPIM and Wespavia SA, respectively.

 
The obligations of SFPI-FPIM and Wespavia SA to fund the equity commitments will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the

termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, and (ii) the Outside Date (which, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, is
August 16, 2017; provided, that either the Company or the Parent may extend the outside date until September 29, 2017 under certain
circumstances discussed further under the caption “The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement”). Upon any such
termination of the equity commitment letters, any obligations thereunder will terminate (with certain exceptions).

 
Debt Financing
 

In anticipation of the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, on February 16, 2017, Parent entered into a debt commitment
letter with ING Bank N.V., as coordinator, and BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV and ING Belgium SA/NV, as the initial lenders, for a commitment
with respect to financing for the acquisition of LMI, the refinancing of certain existing indebtedness of LMI, and to pay fees, costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the Merger.

 
The debt commitment letter provides for the initial lenders to provide debt financing consisting of (i) a euro denominated term loan

facility in the aggregate principal amount of €50 million, (ii) a U.S. dollar denominated term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of
$270 million, and (iii) a euro (and other currency) denominated revolving credit facility in the aggregate amount of up to €60.

 
The initial lenders’ obligation to provide the debt financing under the debt commitment letter is subject to customary conditions,

including, without limitation, the following (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications as set forth in the debt commitment letter):

● compliance by Parent with the terms of the debt commitment letter and the term sheet and fee letters attached thereto;

 
● execution and delivery of definitive documentation consistent with the debt commitment letter no later than April 21, 2017 or any

later date mutually agreed upon by the parties, which such definitive documentation was executed and delivered on April 21,
2017;

 
● the absence of a Company material adverse effect, during the period from the date of the commitment letter to the signing of

definitive documentation;
 

● the accuracy in all material respects of each of the representations and warranties made by the Parent or any of its subsidiaries in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the debt commitment letter and the term sheet and fee letters attached thereto;

 
● no public offer in respect of the shares of the Parent or a merger by the Parent and another person being announced and no person

or group of persons acting in concert gaining control of the Parent;
 

● the final version of legal, tax and financial due diligence in respect of LMI containing no material changes compared to the prior
due diligence received by the initial lenders prior to and until January 18, 2017; and

 
● the delivery of a final structure memorandum satisfactory to the initial lenders.

 
The commitment of the coordinator and the initial lenders under the debt commitment letter expires upon the earliest to occur of (i)

11:59 p.m. Brussels time on September 29, 2017, (ii) the date on which the Parent notifies the coordinator and the initial lenders that the Parent
has irrevocably withdrawn from or ceased to participate in the process by which Parent would acquire shares in LMI pursuant to the Merger
(which notice Parent must provide promptly upon such event occurring), and (iii) the date on which an agreement for the facilities shall have
been entered into by Parent.

 
Treatment of Restricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units
 

Each Restricted Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be fully vested and, at the effective
time, canceled and extinguished and converted into the Merger Consideration. Each RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective
time of the Merger will be fully vested and settled in one share of common stock of LMI and, at the effective time, canceled and extinguished
and converted into the Merger Consideration.

 
Interests of LMI’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger
 

When considering the recommendation of the Board of Directors that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement
and approve the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers

9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

may have interests in the Merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of shareholders generally, as more fully described below.
In (i) evaluating and negotiating the Merger Agreement; (ii) approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger; and (iii) recommending that the
Merger Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby be adopted and approved by shareholders, the Board of
Directors was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters.

 
Furthermore, due to his interests in the transaction described below in this section, Daniel G. Korte, the Company’s President, Chief

Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, abstained from voting as a member of the Board of Directors to approve the Merger
Agreement. Each other member of the Board of Directors, who comprise all of the independent directors on the Board of Directors, voted
unanimously in favor of approving and adopting the Merger Agreement and the Merger.

 
Treatment of Equity-Based Awards
 

Consistent with the treatment for all other Restricted Shares outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger,
Restricted Shares held by directors and executive officers will be fully vested and, at the effective time, canceled and extinguished and
converted into the Merger Consideration. Each RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be fully
vested and settled in one share of common stock of LMI and, at the effective time, canceled and extinguished and converted into the Merger
Consideration.

 
As of April 10, 2017, there were 395,312 outstanding, unvested Restricted Shares and RSUs, of which 270,145 were directly held by

our directors and executive officers. The following table sets forth the number of shares of our common stock and the number of shares of our
common stock underlying Company equity awards that as of April 10, 2017 were directly held by each of our executive officers and non-
employee directors, in each case that either were directly held or that would vest in connection with the Merger, assuming solely for purposes of
this disclosure that the effective time of the Merger occurred on April 10, 2017. The table also sets forth the values of these shares and equity
awards based on the $14.00 per share Merger Consideration. No new shares of our common stock or equity awards were granted to any
executive officer or non-employee director in contemplation of the Merger.

Payments Upon Termination Following Change-in-Control
 
Current Employment Agreements
 

LMI is party to employment agreements with each of the executive officers of LMI as follows: Daniel G. Korte, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Clifford C. Stebe, Jr., Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jennifer Alfaro, Chief Human Resources Officer, Renée
Skonier, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, Jay Inman, President, Engineering Services, Keith Schrader, Vice President,
Operations, and Dave Wright, Vice President, Corporate & Business Development (collectively, the “Current Employment Agreements”).

 
Each Current Employment Agreement provides the above listed executives a base salary that is to be reviewed annually by the

compensation committee of LMI (the “Compensation Committee”) and may be increased, but not decreased. Each Current Executive
Employment Agreement other than Mr. Korte’s Current Employment Agreement, also provides that the executive will be eligible for an annual
performance bonus targeted at thirty percent (30%) of the executive’s base salary, payable in cash or cash and shares of LMI’s stock as
determined by the Compensation Committee, and eligible for long-term incentive grants of restricted stock targeted at $70,000. Mr. Korte’s
Current Employment Agreement provides Mr. Korte is eligible for an annual performance bonus of not less than forty-two and one half percent
(42.5%) of his base salary, but targeted at eighty-five percent (85%) with a maximum of one hundred and ten percent (110%) of his base salary,
payable in cash or cash and shares of LMI’s stock as determined by the Compensation Committee, and grants of restricted stock targeted at one
hundred percent (100%) of his base salary.

 
Each Current Employment Agreement has a three-year term, commencing on January 1, 2017, and expiring on December 31, 2019,

and may be terminated earlier in accordance with the agreement. If the Merger results in the involuntary termination of the executive or the
executive terminates her employment for “good reason” within nine (9) months following the Merger, the executive will be entitled to
severance in an amount equal to two and one-half (2 ½) times her base salary plus any reasonably anticipated performance bonus prorated for
that fiscal year. In addition to the foregoing, if an executive’s employment is terminated due to a Qualifying Termination, such executive shall
be entitled to continued health benefits at a reduced premium for a period equal to the duration of the severance period.

New Employment Agreements
 

In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Parent entered into agreements with the following executive officers of
LMI pursuant to which such executive officers agreed to enter into an employment agreement with the surviving corporation upon closing of
the Merger: Daniel G. Korte, Clifford C. Stebe, Jr., Jay Inman, Keith Schrader, and Dave Wright (collectively, the “Intention Agreements”).

 
The employment agreements contemplated by the Intention Agreements (the “New Employment Agreements”) provide the above

listed executives an annual base salary, which shall be increased by at least three percent (3%) each year, an initial bonus (equal to $750,000 for
Mr. Korte and $105,000 for each of the other executives) to be paid within five (5) calendar days of the closing of the Merger (except in the
event the Board of Directors of LMI awards a long-term incentive to such executive under such executive’s prior employment agreement with
the Company on or before the closing of the Merger, in which case no initial bonus will be payable), and certain other perquisites and benefits
customarily found in employment agreements with executives. Furthermore, beginning in calendar year 2017, each executive will be eligible
for an annual performance bonus, in the case of Mr. Korte, equal to no less than fifty percent (50%) and no more than one hundred and ten
percent (110%), and in the case of Mr. Stebe, no less than twenty-two and one half percent (22.5%) and no more than forty-nine and one half
percent (49.5%), and in the case of the other executives, no less than fifteen percent (15%) and no more than thirty-three percent (33%), of such
executive’s then-current base salary, subject to the achievement of performance objectives for the subject calendar year. Beginning in calendar
year 2018, Mr. Korte will be entitled to an annual time-based long-term incentive payment equal to three quarters times (.75x) the prior year’s
annual base salary and an annual performance incentive payment equal to no less than fifty percent (50%) and no more than one hundred and
ten percent (110%) of three quarters times (.75x) the prior year’s base salary. Also beginning in calendar year 2018, the other executives will be
entitled to an annual long-term incentive payment equal to $52,500 and an annual performance incentive payment with a target of $52,500,
each of which will increase by a minimum of three percent (3%) each calendar year. Both the annual incentive payments and the annual
performance incentive payments shall vest in three equal installments, the first of which shall vest on the last day of the calendar year to which
it pertains, and the second and third installments of which will vest on the last day of the two (2) successive calendar years, in each case subject
to the executive’s continued employment on each such vesting date, and in the case of the annual performance incentive, subject to the
achievement of performance objectives for the subject calendar year. In each case, the vested amounts will be paid on the January 30th
immediately following the applicable vesting date.

 
The New Employment Agreements shall continue until terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the agreement. If an

executive’s employment is terminated without cause by LMI, or for “good reason” by the executive, or through a corporate dissolution (a
“Qualifying Termination”), prior to the first anniversary of the Merger, the executive will be entitled to severance in an amount equal to two
and one-half (2.5x) times such executive’s then current base salary. In the event of a Qualifying Termination following the first anniversary, but
prior to the second anniversary of the Merger, the executive will be entitled to severance in an amount equal to one and one half times (1.5x)
times such executive’s then current base salary. In the event of a Qualifying Termination on or after the second anniversary of the Merger, the

executive will be entitled to severance in an amount equal to one times (1x) such executive’s then current base salary. In addition to the
foregoing, if an executive’s employment is terminated due to a Qualifying Termination, such executive shall be entitled to receive any vested
but unpaid annual incentive payment and/or annual performance incentive payment, a prorated amount of the annual bonus and the annual
performance incentive payment of the calendar year in which the termination occurred, and continued health benefits at a reduced premium for
a period of up to 18 months. Any severance will be paid in equal installments in accordance with the surviving corporation’s regular pay
schedule over the length of the period of base salary on which the amount of severance pay is based, and will be subject to the executive
executing a release agreement.

 
Non-Employee Directors
 

All equity awards held by our non-employee directors will be subject to the treatment described above under “— Treatment of Equity-
Based Awards.”

 
Golden Parachute Compensation
 

In accordance with Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K, the table below sets forth the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to
the Merger that will or may become payable to each of our named executive officers in connection with the Merger. Please see the previous
portions of this section for further information regarding this compensation.

 
The amounts indicated in the table below are estimates of the amounts that would be payable assuming, solely for purposes of this

table, that the Merger is consummated on April 10, 2017, and that the employment of each of the named executive officers was terminated
without cause by LMI, for “good reason” by the executive on April 10, 2017 under the executive’s applicable employment agreement. As
discussed above, under the Intention Agreements with Messrs. Korte, Stebe and Wright, the New Employment Agreements will be entered into
upon the closing of the Merger. Thus, although the agreements are not currently in effect, solely for the purposes of this table, it has been
assumed that the New Employment Agreements are in effect for these individuals. For Mses. Alfaro and Skonier, payments are shown under
the Current Employment Agreements. The assumed April 10, 2017 historical date is used solely for illustrative purposes. Our executive officers
will not receive pension, non-qualified deferred compensation, tax reimbursement or other benefits in connection with the Merger.

 
Some of the amounts set forth in the table would be payable solely by virtue of the consummation of the Merger. In addition to the

assumptions regarding the consummation date of the Merger and the termination of employment, these estimates are based on certain other
assumptions that are described in the footnotes accompanying the table below. Accordingly, the ultimate values to be received by a named
executive officer in connection with the Merger may differ from the amounts set forth below. The values in the table below payable by LMI are
not subject to the non-binding, advisory proposal to approve certain compensation that will or may become payable to our named executive
officers in connection with the Merger.

(1) This amount represents the “double trigger” cash severance payments to which each named executive officer may become entitled under their employment agreements (the
New Employment Agreements, in the case of Messrs. Korte, Stebe and Wright, and the Current Employment Agreements, in the cases of Mses. Alfaro and Skonier), as described
in the section of this proxy statement captioned “— Payments Upon Termination Following Change-in-Control.” This column assumes, solely for the purposes of this table, that

section of this proxy statement captioned “— Payments Upon Termination Following Change-in-Control;.” This column assumes, solely for the purposes of this table, that the
Merger is consummated on April 10, 2017. The assumed April 10, 2017 historical date is used solely for illustrative purposes.
 
Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers
 

The directors and officers of the Corporation are entitled to certain insurance and indemnification rights in connection with the Merger.
See the sections of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement – Indemnification” and “The Merger Agreement – Directors’ and
Officers’ Insurance” for additional information.

 
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
 

Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the Parent and LMI, the closing of the Merger is expected to occur at 10:00 a.m. New
York City time, on the second business day after the conditions to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement and described in the section of
this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to Completion of the Merger” have been satisfied or, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, waived (other than the conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing of the Merger, but subject to
the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waiver of those conditions).

The Merger will become effective upon the filing of the summary articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of

Missouri or at such later time as is agreed upon by Sonaca and LMI and specified in the summary articles of merger. As of the date of this
proxy statement, we expect to complete the Merger by the second half of 2017; however, consummation of the Merger is subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waiver of the conditions to the completion of the Merger more fully described in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to Completion of the Merger” and we cannot specify when, or
assure you that, LMI and Sonaca will satisfy or waive all or any conditions to the Merger. There may be a substantial amount of time between
the date of the Special Meeting and the consummation of the Merger and it is possible that factors outside the control of LMI or Sonaca could
delay the consummation of the Merger, or prevent the Merger from being consummated; however, we expect to consummate the Merger
promptly following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by applicable law) waiver of the conditions more fully described below in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger Agreement — Conditions to Completion of the Merger.”

 
Delisting and Deregistration of LMI Common Stock
 

If the Merger is completed, the LMI common stock will no longer be listed on NASDAQ, we will be deregistered under the Exchange
Act, and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC.

 
Appraisal Rights
 

The discussion of the provisions set forth in this section is not a complete summary regarding your right under Missouri law to be
deemed a dissenting shareholder and entitled to exercise appraisal rights and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of Section
351.455 of the MGBCL, a copy of which is attached as Annex C to this proxy statement and is incorporated herein by reference. Shareholders
intending to exercise appraisal rights should carefully review Annex C to this proxy statement and strictly adhere to Section 351.455 of the
MGBCL. Failure to follow any of the statutory procedures precisely may result in a termination or waiver of these rights. A summary of the
principal steps to be taken is set forth below for any shareholders intending to be deemed a dissenting shareholder and be entitled to and
exercise appraisal rights.

 
ANY HOLDER OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK WHO WISHES TO BE DEEMED A DISSENTING SHAREHOLDER

AND BE ENTITLED TO EXERCISE APPRAISAL RIGHTS, OR WHO WISHES TO PRESERVE SUCH HOLDER’S RIGHT TO
DO SO, SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANNEX C BECAUSE FAILURE TO TIMELY
AND PROPERLY COMPLY WITH THE PROCEDURES SPECIFIED THEREIN WILL RESULT IN THE LOSS OF APPRAISAL
RIGHTS. MOREOVER, BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCEDURES FOR EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO SEEK
APPRAISAL OF SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK, LMI BELIEVES THAT, IF A SHAREHOLDER CONSIDERS
EXERCISING SUCH RIGHTS, SUCH SHAREHOLDER SHOULD SEEK THE ADVICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL.

A shareholder of record will be deemed a dissenting shareholder and entitled to appraisal and payment of the fair value of his, her or

its shares under Section 351.455 of the MGBCL if such shareholder:
 

● owns LMI’s common stock as of the close of business on April 21, 2017, the Record Date for the Special Meeting;
 

● files with the Company, prior to or at the Special Meeting, a written objection to the Merger Agreement. Such objection should be
delivered or mailed in time to arrive at or before the Special Meeting to the Company at LMI Aerospace, Inc., 411 Fountain Lakes
Boulevard, St. Charles, Missouri 63301, Attention: Corporate Secretary. Such written objection must be made in addition to and
separate from any proxy or other vote against the approval of the Merger Agreement. Neither a vote against, a failure to vote for, nor
an abstention from voting will satisfy the requirement that a written objection be delivered to the Company before or at the Special
Meeting;

 
● does not vote in favor of the Merger Agreement (as a result, shareholders who vote “FOR” the proposal to approve the Merger

Agreement will waive their appraisal rights, unless they revoke their proxies, if revocable, prior to the Special Meeting); and
 

● within 20 days after the Merger is effected, makes a written demand on the Company, as the surviving corporation, for payment of the
fair value of such shareholder’s shares of Company common stock as of the day prior to the Special Meeting. This demand must be
mailed or delivered to the Company at LMI Aerospace, Inc., 411 Fountain Lakes Boulevard, St. Charles, Missouri 63301, Attention:
Corporate Secretary. Neither a vote against the approval of the Merger Agreement nor the written objection referred to above
will satisfy the written demand requirement following the effective time of the Merger referred to in this paragraph.

 
Any shareholder who (i) fails to file a written objection to the Merger Agreement prior to or at the Special Meeting, (ii) votes in favor

of the Merger, or (iii) fails to make a written demand for payment within the 20 day period after the effective time of the Merger will be
conclusively presumed to have consented to the Merger Agreement and will be bound by the terms thereof. Any such shareholder will not be
deemed a dissenting shareholder, will forfeit his, her or its appraisal rights, and will be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration of $14.00
per share for his, her or its shares.

 
If, within 30 days after the effective time of the Merger, the fair value of the dissenting shareholder’s shares of Company common

stock is agreed upon between the dissenting shareholder and the surviving corporation, then payment for such shares must be made by the
surviving corporation within 90 days after the effective time of the Merger, upon the surrender of the dissenting shareholder’s stock certificates
representing such shareholder’s shares, in the case of certificated shares. Upon payment of the agreed value, the dissenting shareholder will
cease to have any interest in the shares or in the surviving corporation.

 
If, within 30 days after the effective time of the Merger, there is no such agreement as to the fair value of the dissenting shareholder’s

shares of Company common stock between the

dissenting shareholder and the surviving corporation, then the dissenting shareholder may, within 60 days after the expiration of the 30-day
period, file a petition in any court of competent jurisdiction within the county in which the registered office of the surviving corporation is
situated, asking for a finding and determination of the fair value such shareholder’s shares as of the day prior to the Special Meeting. The
dissenting shareholder will be entitled to judgment against the surviving corporation for an amount equal to the fair value of such shareholder’s
shares measured as of the day prior to the Special Meeting, together with interest thereon to the date of the judgment. Shareholders should be
aware that the fair value of their shares as determined under Section 351.455 of the MGBCL may be more than, the same as or less than the
value of the consideration they would receive pursuant to the Merger Agreement if they do not seek appraisal of their shares. Shareholders
should also be aware that opinions, if any, of investment banking firms (including the Company’s financial advisers) as to the fairness of the
Merger from a financial point of view are not necessarily opinions as to “fair value” under the MGBCL.

 
In the case of certificated shares of Company common stock, the judgment will only be payable upon and simultaneously with the

surrender to the surviving corporation of the stock certificates representing the shares of Company common stock owned by the dissenting
shareholder. Upon payment of the judgment, the shareholder will cease to have any interest in the shares or in the surviving corporation.
Further, unless the dissenting shareholder files the petition with the court within any of the time limits described above, such shareholder and all
persons claiming under such shareholder shall be conclusively presumed to have approved or ratified the Merger and shall be bound by the
terms thereof. The right of a dissenting shareholder to be paid the fair value of such shareholder’s shares as provided above ceases if and when
LMI abandons the Merger.

 
We do not intend to object, assuming the proper procedures are followed and the shareholder qualifies under the statute, to any

shareholders’ demand for payment of the fair value of his, her or its shares. We intend, however, to argue in any discussions or negotiations
with dissenting shareholders or in any court proceeding that, for such purposes, the fair value of each share is less than or equal to the per share
Merger Consideration.

 
To be effective, a written objection to the Merger Agreement and a demand for appraisal by a holder of Company common stock must

be made by, or in the name of, the person in whose name shares are registered in the records of the Company. The written objection and
demand cannot be made by the beneficial (“street name”) holder if he, she or it does not also hold shares of Company common stock registered
in his, her or its name in the records of the Company. The “street name” holder must, in such cases, have the registered owner, such as the
broker, bank, trust or other nominee, submit the required written objection and demand in respect of those shares of stock. If you hold your
shares of Company common stock in a brokerage account or through another nominee, such as a bank or trust, and you wish to be deemed a
dissenting shareholder and exercise appraisal rights, you should consult with your broker, bank, trust or other nominee to determine the
appropriate procedures for filing a written objection to the Merger Agreement and making a demand for appraisal. Please contact your broker,
bank, trust or other nominee for further information.

 
Under Missouri law, dissenting shareholder and appraisal rights are your exclusive remedy as to the Merger, except in the case of fraud

or lack of authorization for the Merger.

In view of the complexity of Section 351.455 of the MGBCL, shareholders of the Company who may wish to dissent from the

Merger and pursue appraisal rights should consult their legal advisors before attempting to exercise these rights. To the extent there are any
inconsistencies between the foregoing summary and Section 351.455 of the MGBCL, Section 351.455 of the MGBCL shall govern.

 
Accounting Treatment
 

It is currently the intent to have the Merger accounted for as a “purchase transaction” for Belgian financial accounting purposes.
 

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger
 

The following is a general discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger to holders of Company
common stock whose shares are exchanged for cash pursuant to the Merger. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Code, applicable
U.S. Treasury regulations, judicial opinions, and administrative rulings and published positions of the Internal Revenue Service, each as in
effect as of the date hereof. These authorities are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could affect the
accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the
unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, nor does it address any tax
considerations under state, local or foreign laws or U.S. federal laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax. This discussion
is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or the courts and, therefore, could be subject to challenge, which could be sustained. No ruling is
intended to be sought from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the Merger.

 
For purposes of this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of Company common stock (other than with respect

to Restricted Shares and RSUs) that is:
 
● a citizen or individual resident of the United States;

 
● a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the

laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia;
 

● a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more
U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable
U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person; or

 
● an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source.

For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of Company common stock (other than with respect to
Restricted Shares), other than a partnership or other entity taxable as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that is not a U.S.
Holder.

 
With respect to U.S. Holders, this discussion applies only to U.S. Holders of shares of Company common stock who hold such shares

as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). Further, this discussion does not
purport to consider all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to a U.S. Holder in light of its particular circumstances, or
that may apply to a U.S. Holder that is subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (including, for example, insurance
companies, controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, dealers or brokers in securities or foreign currencies, traders
in securities who elect the mark-to-market method of accounting, holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, U.S. Holders that have a
functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, banks and certain other financial institutions, mutual funds, certain
expatriates, partnerships, S corporations, or other pass-through entities or investors in partnerships or such other entities, U.S. Holders who hold
shares of Company common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale or conversion transaction, U.S. Holders who will hold, directly
or indirectly, an equity interest in the surviving corporation, and U.S. Holders who acquired their shares of Company common stock through the
exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements).

 
If a partnership (including for this purpose any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes)

holds shares of Company common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend on the status of the partners
and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding shares of Company common stock, you should consult your
tax advisor.

 
Holders of Company common stock are urged to consult their own tax advisors to determine the particular tax consequences

to them of the Merger, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax, and any state, local, foreign or other tax
laws.

 
Consequences to U.S. Holders
 
The receipt of cash by U.S. Holders in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the Merger will be a taxable

transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may also be a taxable transaction under applicable state, local, foreign and other tax laws.
In general, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder who receives cash in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant
to the Merger will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the amount of cash received (computed as if
there were no applicable withholding taxes) and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such shares.

 
If a U.S. Holder’s holding period in the shares of Company common stock surrendered in the Merger is greater than one year as of the

date of the Merger, the gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss. Long term capital gains of certain non-corporate holders, including
individuals, are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates. The

deductibility of a capital loss recognized on the exchange is subject to limitations. If a U.S. Holder acquired different blocks of Company
common stock at different times and different prices, such U.S. Holder must determine its adjusted tax basis and holding period separately with
respect to each block of Company common stock.

 
Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders
 
A Non-U.S. Holder whose shares of Company common stock are converted into the right to receive cash in the Merger generally will

not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation unless:
 

● gain resulting from the Merger is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if
required by any applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a United States permanent establishment of the Non-U.S. Holder);

 
● the Non-U.S. Holder is an individual who is “substantially present” in the United States for 183 days or more in the individual’s

taxable year in which the Merger occurs and certain other conditions are satisfied; or
 

● the Company is or has been a U.S. real property holding corporation (the “USRPHC”) as defined in Section 897 of the Code at any
time within the five-year period preceding the Merger, the Non-U.S. Holder owned more than five percent of the Company common
stock at any time within that five-year period, and certain other conditions are satisfied.

 
Any gain recognized by a Non-U.S. Holder described in the first bullet above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a

net income basis at regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates in the same manner as if such holder were a “U.S. person” as defined under
the Code. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation may also be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate
as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on after-tax profits effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business to the extent that
such after-tax profits are not reinvested and maintained in the U.S. business.

 
Gain described in the second bullet above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat 30% rate, but may be offset by

certain U.S. source capital losses, if any, of the Non-U.S. Holder. An individual is “substantially present” in the U.S. if such individual is
physically present in the U.S. on at least 31 calendar days during the current calendar year and 183 days during the current year and the two
preceding years, counting all the days of physical presence in the current year, but only one-third the number of days of presence in the first
preceding year, and only one-sixth the number of days in the second preceding year.

 
With respect to the third bullet above, generally, the Company will be a USRPHC if the fair market value of our U.S. real property

interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market values of our worldwide (domestic and foreign) real property interests and other
assets used or held for use in a trade or business, all as determined under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. We believe that we are not
currently and do not expect to become a USRPHC. Even if we are a USRPHC, as long as our common stock is regularly traded on an
established securities market, such common stock will be treated as a U.S. real property interest only if the Non-U.S. Holder actually or
constructively held more than five percent of our common stock at

any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the disposition or the Non-U.S. Holder’s holding period for our common stock.
 
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
 
Payments made in exchange for shares of Company common stock pursuant to the Merger may be subject, under certain

circumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding (currently at a rate of 28%). To avoid backup withholding, a U.S. Holder that
does not otherwise establish an exemption should complete and return Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, certifying that such U.S. Holder is
a U.S. person, the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and such U.S. Holder is not subject to backup withholding. In general, a
Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding and information reporting with respect to cash payments to the Non-
U.S. Holder pursuant to the Merger if the Non-U.S. Holder has provided an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (or an Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8ECI if the Non-U.S. Holder’s gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business).

 
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited

against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the Internal Revenue
Service in a timely manner.

 
Additional Withholding Considerations
 
Pursuant to legislation commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), foreign financial institutions

(which include most foreign hedge funds, private equity funds, mutual funds, securitization vehicles and other investment vehicles) and certain
other foreign entities must comply with information reporting rules with respect to their U.S. account holders and investors or pay a
withholding tax on U.S. source payments made to them (whether received as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary for another party). More
specifically, a foreign financial institution or other foreign entity that does not comply with the FATCA reporting requirements will generally be
subject to a 30% withholding tax with respect to any “withholdable payments”. For this purpose, withholdable payments generally include U.S.
source payments otherwise subject to nonresident withholding tax (e.g., U.S. source dividends) and also include the entire gross proceeds from
the sale of any equity or debt instruments of U.S. issuers. The new FATCA withholding tax will apply even if the payment would otherwise not
be subject to U.S. nonresident withholding tax (e.g., capital gain). Final Treasury regulations and IRS guidance defer this withholding
obligation for gross proceeds from dispositions of U.S. common stock until after December 31, 2018.

 
This summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice.

Holders of Company common stock should consult their tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences to them of the Merger, including the
applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and the effect of any federal, state, local, foreign and other tax laws.

Governmental and Regulatory Approvals
 

Antitrust Approval in the U.S.
 
Under the HSR Act and related rules, certain transactions, including the Merger, may not be completed until notifications have been

given and information furnished to the Antitrust Division and the FTC and all statutory waiting period requirements have been satisfied. On
March 10, 2017, both the Company and Parent filed their respective Notification and Report Forms with the Antitrust Division and the FTC,
and each requested early termination of the 30-day statutory waiting period. The Antitrust Division and the FTC granted the requests by the
Company and Parent for early termination of the waiting period, effective April 11, 2017 at 2:13 p.m. Eastern time and 2:12 p.m. Eastern time,
respectively.

 
At any time before or after the effective time of the Merger, the Antitrust Division or the FTC could take action under the antitrust

laws, including seeking to prevent the Merger, to rescind the Merger or to conditionally approve the Merger upon the divestiture of assets of the
Company or Parent or subject to regulatory conditions or other remedies. In addition, U.S. state attorneys general could take action under the
antitrust laws as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest, including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the completion of the
Merger or permitting completion of the Merger subject to regulatory conditions. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the
antitrust laws under some circumstances. There can be no assurance that a challenge to the Merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if
such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

 
Antitrust Approval in Non-U.S. Jurisdictions
 
The Merger is also conditioned on the absence of any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, law or other

order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction in effect enjoining or otherwise preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger.
Foreign antitrust authorities may take action under the antitrust laws of their jurisdictions including, without limitation, seeking to enjoin the
completion of the Merger or permitting completion of the Merger subject to regulatory conditions. There can be no assurance that a challenge to
the Merger under foreign antitrust laws will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would not be successful.

 
CFIUS Clearance
 
The Merger is also conditioned on the issuance by CFIUS of a written notification to the parties to the Merger Agreement that it has

concluded a review of the notification voluntarily provided pursuant to the DPA, and determined not to conduct a full investigation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or, if a full investigation is deemed to be required, notification that the U.S. government
will not take action to prevent the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement from being consummated.

 
The Merger Agreement provides for LMI and Parent jointly submit a draft and a final notice with CFIUS regarding the Merger. Under

the terms of the Merger Agreement, consummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver by all parties of the condition that one
of the following shall have occurred: (i) CFIUS has concluded that the Merger and the

transactions contemplated thereby are not a “covered transaction” and not subject to review under applicable law; (ii) the review of the Merger
and the transactions contemplated thereby by the DPA has been concluded, and there are no unresolved national security concerns with respect
to such transactions; or (iii) CFIUS has sent a report to the President of the United States requesting the President’s decision on the CFIUS
filing submitted by the parties and either (A) the period under the DPA during which the President may announce his decision to take action to
suspend, prohibit or place any limitations on the Transactions has expired without any such action being threatened, announced or taken or (B)
the President has announced a decision not to take any action to suspend, prohibit or place any limitations on the Merger on the transactions
contemplated thereby.

 
On March 17, 2017, LMI and Parent submitted a draft joint notice with CFIUS. On April 3, 2017, LMI and Parent submitted the final

joint voluntary notice with CFIUS. On April 10, 2017, CFIUS accepted the parties’ joint notice and began its initial 30-day review period.
 
DDTC Approval
 
The Merger also cannot be completed unless and until (i) 60 days have passed since LMI notified the DDTC of the Merger and the

DDTC has not taken or threatened to take enforcement action against Parent in connection with the consummation of the Merger or (ii) the
DDTC has notified LMI or Parent that it does not intend to take enforcement action against Parent in connection with the consummation of the
Merger.

 
On April 21, 2017, LMI submitted notification of the Merger to the staff of the DDTC.
 

Litigation Related to the Merger
 

On March 24, 2017, a shareholder class action complaint was filed in connection with our entry into the Merger Agreement in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against the Company, the Board of Directors, Parent, Intermediate Co, and Sub:
The Vladimir Gusinsky Rev. Trust v. LMI Aerospace, Inc., et. al., Case No. 4:17-cv-01090-SPM (the “Gusinsky Complaint”). On March 27,
2017 a second shareholder class action complaint was filed in connection with our entry into the Merger Agreement in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri against the Company and the Board of Directors: Madjid Benchabane v. LMI Aerospace, Inc.,
et. al., Case No. 4:17-cv-01100 (the “Benchabane Complaint” and together with the Gusinsky Compliant, the “Complaints”). The Complaints
bring claims under Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act pertaining to the purported dissemination of allegedly misleading
proxy materials. The Gusinsky Complaint seeks, among other things, declaration that the action is properly maintainable as a class action; an
order enjoining the defendants from consummating the Merger; in the event the Merger is consummated, an order rescinding it and setting it
aside or awarding rescissory damages; dissemination of a proxy statement that does not contain the allegedly misleading information; and
unspecified attorneys’ fees and costs. The Benchabane Complaint seeks, among other things, declaration that the action is properly
maintainable as a class action; an order enjoining the defendants from consummating the Merger unless allegedly omitted information is
disclosed in the proxy; and unspecified damages, attorneys’ fees and costs.

The outcome of the lawsuits is uncertain. If the lawsuits are not dismissed or otherwise resolved, they could delay or prevent the

completion of the Merger, and could result in substantial costs to the Company. One of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is that no
temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, law or other governmental order issued by any court of competent
jurisdiction is in effect enjoining or otherwise preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger. As such, if either of the plaintiffs are
successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Merger on the agreed upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the
Merger from becoming effective, or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.

THE MERGER AGREEMENT
 

Explanatory Note Regarding the Merger Agreement
 

The following summary describes the material provisions of the Merger Agreement. The descriptions of the Merger Agreement in this
summary and elsewhere in this proxy statement are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the Merger Agreement, a
copy of which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A and is incorporated into this proxy statement by reference. We encourage you to
read the Merger Agreement carefully and in its entirety because this summary may not contain all the information about the Merger Agreement
that is important to you. The rights and obligations of the parties are governed by the express terms of the Merger Agreement and not by this
summary or any other information contained in this proxy statement. Capitalized terms in this section but not defined in this proxy statement
have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

 
The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements described in this section and included in the Merger Agreement: (i) were

made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement and as of specific dates; (ii) were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger
Agreement; and (iii) may be subject to important qualifications, limitations and supplemental information agreed to by LMI, Parent,
Intermediate Co, and Sub in connection with negotiating the terms of the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may also be
subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable to reports and documents filed with the SEC and, in
some cases, were qualified by matters disclosed to Parent, Intermediate Co and Sub by LMI in the disclosure letter to the Merger Agreement. In
addition, the representations and warranties may have been included in the Merger Agreement for the purposes of allocating contractual risk
between the parties to the Merger Agreement, rather than to establish matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable
to such parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Shareholders are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement (other
than to enforce payment of the Merger Consideration after the effective time) and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of LMI, Parent, Intermediate Co, or Sub
or any of their respective affiliates or businesses. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties
may have changed after the date of the Merger Agreement and do not purport to be accurate as of the date of this proxy statement and,
accordingly, you should not rely on such representations and warranties as characterizations of the actual state of facts at the time they were
made or as of the date of this proxy statement. In addition, you should not rely on the covenants in the Merger Agreement as actual limitations
on the respective businesses of LMI, Parent, Intermediate Co and Sub because the parties may take certain actions that are either expressly
permitted in the disclosure letter delivered by LMI in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement or as otherwise consented to by
the appropriate party, which consent may be given without prior notice to the public. The Merger Agreement is described below, and included
as Annex A, only to provide you with information regarding its terms and conditions, and not to provide you with any other factual information
regarding LMI, Parent, Intermediate

Co or Sub or their respective businesses or affiliates. Accordingly, the representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in the
Merger Agreement should not be read alone and you should read the information provided elsewhere in this document and in our filings with
the SEC regarding LMI and our business.

 
Form and Effects of the Merger; Directors and Officers; Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
 

At the effective time of the Merger, Sub will merge with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Sub will cease.
The Company will be the surviving corporation in the Merger and will continue its corporate existence as a Missouri corporation after the
Merger, and all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Sub, and all claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and
duties of the Company and Sub, shall become the properties, rights, privileges, powers, franchises, claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and
duties of the surviving corporation.

 
The surviving corporation will be a privately held corporation and our current shareholders, other than any LMI executive officers and

other key employees who will hold an ownership interest in the surviving corporation, will cease to have any ownership interest in the
surviving corporation or rights as our shareholders. Therefore, such current shareholders will not participate in any future earnings or growth of
the surviving corporation and will not benefit from any appreciation in value of the surviving corporation.

 
The articles of incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be amended and

restated in their entirety to read as the articles of incorporation of Sub as of the effective time of the Merger, and, as so amended, will be the
articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the MGBCL and such articles of
incorporation. The bylaws of the Company will be amended and restated in their entirety to read as the bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the effective time of the Merger, and, as so amended, will be the bylaws of the surviving corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the MGBCL and such bylaws. Subject to applicable law, the directors of Sub as of immediately prior to the effective time of
the Merger will be the initial directors of the surviving corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the effective time of
the Merger will be the initial officers of the surviving corporation.

 
Closing and Effective Time of the Merger
 

The closing of the Merger will take place at the offices of Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP, located at 250 W 55th Street, New
York, New York, 10019, at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date which will be the second business day after the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by law) waiver by the party having the benefit of the applicable condition of the closing conditions stated in the Merger
Agreement (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by law) waiver by the party having the benefit of the applicable condition of such conditions) or at such other place, date and time as
the Company and Parent, may agree in writing.

The Merger will become effective at the time the summary articles of merger are filed with the Secretary of State of the State of

Missouri (or at such later time as is agreed upon by the parties to the Merger Agreement and specified in the summary articles of merger),
which we refer to as the “effective time” of the Merger. We expect to complete the Merger as promptly as practicable after our shareholders
adopt the Merger Agreement (assuming the prior satisfaction of the other closing conditions to the Merger as described below).

 
Merger Consideration
 
Effect of the Merger on LMI’s Common Stock
 

At the effective time of the Merger, except as noted below, each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time will be automatically cancelled and converted at the effective time into the right to receive $14.00 in cash, without interest
and less any applicable withholding taxes. The following shares of common stock will not receive the Merger Consideration:

 
● treasury shares owned directly by the Company, which shares will be automatically cancelled without consideration;

 
● shares held by Parent, Intermediate Co or Sub, which shares will be automatically cancelled without conversion or consideration; and

 
● shares held by holders who did not vote in favor of the Merger (and who objected to the Merger Agreement in writing) and who are

entitled to demand and have properly demanded appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who have complied in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 351.455 of the MGBCL, and which shares will be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares as may be
determined to be due to such holders pursuant to Section 351.455 of the MGBCL (unless and until such holder has failed to perfect or
has effectively withdrawn or lost rights of appraisal under Section 351.455 of the MGBCL).

 
At the effective time of the Merger, each holder of a certificate formerly representing any shares of common stock or evidence of

shares in book-entry form (other than shares for which appraisal rights have been properly demanded, perfected and not withdrawn or lost
under Section 351.455 of the MGBCL) will no longer have any rights with respect to the shares, except for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration upon surrender thereof. See the section of this proxy captioned “The Merger —Appraisal Rights” for more information regarding
appraisal rights.

 
At the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time

of the Merger will be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the surviving corporation.

 
Treatment of LMI Equity-Based Awards
 

The Merger Agreement provides that the Company’s equity awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger will be subject to the following treatment at

the effective time of the Merger:

 
Restricted Shares
 
As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of the Merger Agreement, the Company is required to adopt such resolutions and

take such other actions as may be required so that each Restricted Share granted under LMI’s equity incentive plans that is outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger shall be fully vested and, at the effective time of the Merger, canceled and extinguished,
and converted into the right receive, on the date which the effective time of the Merger occurs, an amount in cash equal to the $14.00 per share
Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

 
Restricted Stock Units
 
As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of the Merger Agreement, the Company is required to adopt such resolutions and

take such other actions as may be required so that each RSU granted under LMI’s equity incentive plans that is outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time of the Merger shall be fully vested and settled into one share of Company common stock and, at the effective time of the
Merger, canceled and extinguished, and converted into the right receive, on the date which the effective time of the Merger occurs, an amount
in cash equal to the $14.00 per share Merger Consideration, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes.

 
Exchange and Payment Procedures
 

Prior to the effective time of the Merger, Parent will designate a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to receive the
aggregate Merger Consideration for the benefit of the holders of shares of our common stock. At or prior to the effective time, Parent will
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the paying agent an amount in cash equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration.

 
As promptly as reasonably practical after the effective time of the Merger (and in any event, no later than the second business day

following the effective time of the Merger), the surviving corporation will cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of record of our shares
a letter of transmittal and instructions advising such holders how to surrender their certificates for the Merger Consideration. The paying agent
will pay each holder of record the per share Merger Consideration upon its receipt of (i) surrendered certificates, (ii) a signed letter of
transmittal and (iii) any other items reasonably required by the paying agent. Holders of record of our common stock holding book-entry shares
do not need to surrender any certificate or complete a letter of transmittal in order to receive payment from the paying agent. As promptly as
practicable after the effective time of the Merger (and in any event, no later than the second business day following the effective time of the
Merger) the surviving corporation will cause the paying agent to issue and deliver to each holder of Company common stock represented in
book-entry form, a check or wire transfer in an amount of the Merger Consideration for each share of book-entry shares held by such holders.
Interest will not be paid or accrue in respect of the Merger Consideration. The surviving corporation will reduce the amount of any Merger

STOCK CERTIFICATES TO THE PAYING AGENT WITHOUT A LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL, AND YOU SHOULD NOT RETURN
YOUR STOCK CERTIFICATES WITH THE ENCLOSED PROXY.

 
On the close of business on the day on which the effective time of the Merger occurs, we will close our stock transfer books. After that

time, there will be no further transfer of shares of our common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger.

 
If any cash deposited with the paying agent is not claimed within nine months following the effective time of the Merger, such cash

will be returned to the Parent, upon demand, and any holders of certificates or book entry shares who have not complied with the share
certificate exchange procedures in the Merger Agreement may thereafter only look to Parent for, and Parent will remain liable for, payment of
their claims for the Merger Consideration.

 
If the paying agent is to pay some or all of a shareholder’s Merger Consideration to a person other than the person in whose name the

certificate surrendered is registered in the transfer records of the company, then (i) in the case of a stock certificate, the certificate must be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and (ii) the person requesting payment must pay any transfer or other similar
taxes payable by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder or establish to the Parent’s
reasonable satisfaction that the taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid.

 
The letter of transmittal will include instructions if the shareholder has lost the share certificate or if it has been stolen or destroyed.

The shareholder will have to provide an affidavit to that fact and, if required by the Parent, post a bond in an amount that Parent or the
surviving corporation reasonably directs as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it in respect of the share certificate in order
for the paying agent to deliver applicable Merger Consideration.

For purposes of the Merger Agreement, a “Company material adverse effect” means any change, effect, event, state of facts,

the underlying factors contributing to such changes shall not be excluded);

and including the impact of any of the foregoing on any relationship, contractual or otherwise, with customers, suppliers, distributors,
collaboration partners, employees or regulators; and

Go-Shop; Acquisition Proposals; Change of Recommendation
 
Go-Shop; Acquisition Proposals
 

From February 16, 2017 and continuing until the go-shop period end date (11:59 p.m. (New York time) on March 18, 2017), the
Company and its subsidiaries and their respective representatives were permitted to:

 
● solicit (whether publicly or otherwise) any inquiry or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes an acquisition proposal,

including by providing information (including non-public information and data) regarding the Company and its subsidiaries, pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement, and

 
● participate in any discussions or negotiations with respect to any acquisition proposals and cooperate with or assist with any such

discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any acquisition proposals, including by providing information
(including non-public information and data) regarding the Company and its subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement.

 
The Company was required to notify Parent in writing of the identity of any qualified purchaser (as defined below) no later than March 23,
2017 (four business days after the go-shop period end date). The Company did not receive any alternative acquisition proposals as of the go-
shop period end date and, accordingly, there were no qualified purchasers.
 

After the go-shop period end date, and subject to certain exceptions described below, we and our subsidiaries are required not to (and
are required to direct our representatives not to), directly or indirectly:

 
● initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of providing information) the submission or making of any

requests, inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any acquisition proposal or engage in,
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto, or otherwise cooperate with or
assist or participate in, or facilitate, any such requests, proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations or furnish to any person or entity
any nonpublic information in furtherance of or afford access to the books and records or the directors, officers, employees or other

any of its subsidiaries to any person with respect to, any proposal or offer that constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in

any acquisition proposal;
 

● except as expressly permitted by the Merger Agreement’s fiduciary out exceptions, approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve, endorse or recommend, an acquisition proposal, or enter into any confidentiality agreement, merger agreement,
letter of intent, agreement in principle, purchase agreement, option agreement, or other agreement providing for or relating to an
acquisition proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement as set forth below) or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or breach
its obligations thereunder or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing;

 
● take any action to make the provisions of any takeover law inapplicable to any transaction contemplated by an acquisition proposal;

 
● terminate, amend, release, modify or fail to enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or request under, any standstill,

confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by the Company in respect of or in contemplation of an acquisition proposal; or
 

● publicly propose to do any of the foregoing.
 

After the go-shop period end date, we agreed to, and have and have caused our subsidiaries and our and their representatives to,
immediately cease and terminate any solicitation, knowing encouragement, discussion or negotiation or cooperation with, or assistance or
participation in, or facilitation of any inquires, proposals, discussions or negotiations with any persons or entities conducted prior to the date of
the Merger Agreement with respect to any acquisition proposal (as defined below).

 
Notwithstanding the restrictions above, if after the go-shop period end date and prior to the date and time on which Shareholder

Approval is obtained, (i) the Company receives an unsolicited written acquisition proposal from a third party that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith to be bona fide, (ii) such acquisition proposal did not result in any material respect from a breach of the covenant not
to solicit under the Merger Agreement, (iii) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or would be reasonably expected to result in a superior proposal (as defined below)
and that the failure to take the action described immediately below with respect to the third party making such an acquisition proposal would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, then the Company may (upon written notice to Parent
after any such determination by the Board of Directors):

 
● enter into a confidentiality agreement (on terms no more favorable to the other party than those in the confidentiality agreement

previously entered into between Parent and the Company) with the person or entity making such acquisition proposal and furnish
information with respect to the Company and our subsidiaries to that person or entity; and

9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

● participate in discussions or negotiations with the person or entity making such acquisition proposal.

 
Following the go-shop period end date, the Company is required to promptly notify Parent if it takes any action described in the previous

paragraph and provide a copy of any related acquisition proposal, must keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis of any material
developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any acquisition proposals and, upon the reasonable request of Parent, must apprise Parent
of the status of those discussions or negotiations.

 
An “acquisition proposal” means any inquiry, offer or proposal from any person or entity that is structured to permit such person or

entity (other than the Parent, Intermediate Co or the Sub or their respective affiliates) to acquire, directly or indirectly and in a single transaction
or a series of related transactions,

 
● 15% or more (based on the fair market value, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) of the assets (including capital

stock of the subsidiaries of the Company) of the Company and its subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis;
 

● shares of Company common stock which, together with any other shares of Company common stock beneficially owned by such
person or entity, would be equal to 15% or more of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company common stock or any other class
of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

 
● any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any person or entity owning, directly or indirectly, shares of

Company common stock equal to 15% or more of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company common stock or any other
equity securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries;

 
● any merger, consolidation, business combination, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its

subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or entity (or the shareholders of any person, entity or group) would own, directly or
indirectly, 15% or more of the aggregate voting power of the Company or of the surviving entity in a merger or the resulting direct or
indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity; or

 
● any recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or any other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its material operating

subsidiaries, other than, in each case, the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
 

A “qualified purchaser” means any person or group of persons from whom the Company or any of its representatives received prior to
the go-shop period end date a written acquisition proposal that the Board of Directors determines in good faith (such determination to be made
no later than four business days after the go-shop period end date) is or could reasonably be expected to result in a superior proposal; and

 

115



9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

A “superior proposal” means any bona fide written acquisition proposal that did not result in any material respect from a violation of

Company’s obligations not to solicit proposals that the Board of Directors determines in good faith (i) is reasonably likely to be consummated
in accordance with its terms and the financing of which is fully committed or reasonably likely to be obtained and (ii) would be more favorable
to the shareholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account all terms and conditions thereof
(including all financial, legal, financing, regulatory and other aspects of such acquisition proposal (including the person or group making the
acquisition proposal, the financing terms thereof, the expected timing and risk and likelihood of consummation)) and of the Merger Agreement
(including any changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement proposed by the Parent, Intermediate Co and Sub); provided, that for purposes of
the definition of “superior proposal,” the references to “15%” in the definition of acquisition proposal shall be deemed to be references to
“66.66%.”

 
Change of Recommendation
 

Until the earlier of the effective time of the Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement, neither the Board of Directors nor any
committee thereof is permitted to (we refer to the actions below collectively, as a “Change of Recommendation”):

 
● withdraw, qualify or modify or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or modify in any manner its recommendation that our

shareholders adopt the Merger Agreement;
 

● if a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of capital stock of the Company that constitutes an acquisition proposal is commenced,
fail to recommend against the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the shareholders of the Company (including by
taking no position) within ten business days after commencement thereof;

 
● approve or recommend or publicly propose to approve or recommend an acquisition proposal; or

 
● approve or recommend or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or execute any letter of intent, agreement in principle,

acquisition or other agreement relating to any acquisition proposal.
 

Notwithstanding these restrictions, at any time prior to the time Shareholder Approval has been obtained, if the Board of Directors
determines in good faith that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, the Board
of Directors may:

 
● change its recommendation as a result of an event, development or change in circumstances that first occurred or became known after

the date of the Merger Agreement, other than with respect to a superior proposal; or
 

● change its recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive alternative acquisition agreement, with
respect to a superior proposal. 

 

116



9/4/2019 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1059562/000162612917000284/lmi-defm14a_060817.htm 128/255

 

 
The Board of Directors may not change its recommendation or terminate the Merger Agreement in the two circumstances described in the
paragraph above unless the superior proposal did not result in any material respect from a breach by the Company of its obligations not to
solicit proposals (in the case of a superior proposal) and:
 

● the Company has provided four business days’ prior written notice to the Parent, Intermediate Co and Sub of its intention to make a
change of recommendation or, in connection with a superior proposal, terminate the Merger Agreement; and

 
● prior to changing its recommendation or terminating the Merger Agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior

proposal, (i) the Company has negotiated with the Parent in good faith to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement, and (ii) the Board of Directors has determined in good faith that the superior proposal still constitutes a superior proposal
or it would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties to the holders of Company
common stock under applicable law to not effect a change in recommendation.

 
In the event of any material revision to the terms of any superior proposal or acquisition proposal that the Board of Directors

determines no longer constitutes a superior proposal, including any change in the price terms, the Company must deliver a new written notice to
the Parent, Intermediate Co and Sub within two business days.

 
Obligations with Respect to Proxy Statement
 

The Merger Agreement required the Company, as soon as practicable after February 16, 2017, to prepare and file with the SEC in
preliminary form a proxy statement relating to the shareholders’ meeting to be held for purposes of voting upon the adoption of the Merger
Agreement, which was required to include the Board of Directors’ recommendation that the Company’s shareholders adopt the Merger
Agreement, the opinion of Lazard (if not withdrawn and subject to the consent of Lazard) and a copy of Section 351.455 of the MGBCL. The
Company filed a preliminary proxy statement meeting such requirements on March 15, 2017.

 
In addition, the Company is required to, as promptly as practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the

proxy statement or notifies the Company that it does not intend to review the proxy statement (or any waiting period during which the SEC may
comment on the proxy statement expires), (i) establish a record date (if not previously established) for and give notice of a meeting of its
shareholders for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of the Merger Agreement and (ii) mail the proxy statement to the holders of shares of
Company common stock as of the Record Date established for the shareholders’ meeting. This proxy statement fulfills such obligation.

 
The Merger Agreement also required the shareholders’ meeting to be held no later than 35 calendar days following the date on which

the proxy statement is mailed to the Company’s shareholders. However, on March 31, 2017 Sonaca executed a waiver extending this 35-day
requirement to 42 calendar days in order to permit the Company to mail this proxy statement on or about April 28, 2017 and hold the Special
Meeting on June 8, 2017.

to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the financing on the
terms and conditions described in the financing commitments, including using their reasonable best efforts to:

 
● maintain in effect the debt financing commitments (which we refer to as the “debt financing”) and equity financing commitments

(which we refer to as the “equity financing”) relating to the financing of the Merger (which we refer to collectively as the “financing
commitments”), in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof;

 
● timely negotiate all definitive documents evidencing the financing, timely satisfy all conditions to the financing and otherwise

consummate the financing at or prior to the closing of the Merger; and
 

● enforce the financing commitments.
 

Furthermore, Parent is required to keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to obtain and consummate the debt financing. In the event any portion of the debt financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the debt commitment letter, the Parent, Intermediate Co and Sub are required to use their reasonable best efforts to
arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, subject to approval by the Company under certain circumstances.

 
Prior to the closing of the Merger and subject to certain exceptions, the Company is required to use reasonable best efforts to cooperate

with Parent in connection with the arrangement of the financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent.
 

Existing Notes and Industrial Revenue Bonds
 

If requested by Parent, the Company is required to, and as applicable, cause its subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and its subsidiaries’ respective representatives to, as soon as reasonably practicable following any request by Parent to do so, and in each
case on such terms and conditions, including pricing terms, specified by Parent (with certain exceptions):

 
● commence one or more conditional offers to purchase for such principal amount of the Company’s 7.375% senior secured notes due

2019 (which we refer to as the “existing notes”) specified by Parent (which we refer to as an “offer to purchase”); and/or
 

● commence one or more consent solicitations (which we refer to as a “consent solicitation”) for such amendments to the indenture
governing such existing note (which

we refer to as the “indenture”) specified by Parent, including the elimination of all or substantially all of the restrictive covenants

contained in the indenture;
 

● amend the terms of any outstanding offer to purchase or consent solicitation; or
 

● waive any of the conditions to any offer to purchase or consent solicitation (other than the occurrence of the closing of the Merger);
 

Furthermore, upon receipt of the requisite consents for any consent solicitation and the satisfaction of any other applicable conditions
precedent, the Company is required to execute a supplemental indenture implementing the applicable indenture amendments to become
effective immediately and operative upon the occurrence of the Merger, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the trustee of the
indenture to enter into such supplemental indenture. Upon consummation of any offer to purchase and in accordance with the terms thereof, the
Company is required to accept for purchase and purchase all existing notes properly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to such offer
to purchase.

 
As directed by and in coordination with Parent, in lieu of commencing an offer to purchase and/or consent solicitation, or in addition

thereto, the Company must, and must, as applicable, cause its subsidiaries to, and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries’
respective representatives to:

 
● send a conditional notice of redemption to the trustee of the indenture providing for redemption of the existing notes on the closing

date of the Merger, or such other date as is reasonably agreed by Parent and the Company;
 

● take such actions and prepare and deliver all other documents (including any customary officers certificates and legal opinions) as are
required under the Indenture and other documents governing the existing notes to cause the Trustee to issue the Notice of Redemption
to holders of the existing notes and to otherwise facilitate the redemption of the existing notes; or

 
● take such actions and prepare and deliver all other documents (including any customary officers certificates and legal opinions) as are

required under the indenture and other documents governing the existing notes to cause and otherwise facilitate the satisfaction and/or
discharge of the existing notes pursuant to the applicable sections of the indenture.

 
The Company has agreed to, and as applicable, has agreed to cause its subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its

subsidiaries’ respective representatives to, as soon as reasonably practicable following any request by Parent to do so, and in each case on such
terms and conditions, specified by Parent (with certain exceptions) redeem certain of the outstanding industrial revenue bonds (which we refer
to as the “IRBs”) issued by the City of Washington, Missouri or the City of Fredonia, Kansas and/or obtain certain consents or waivers
contained in such industrial revenue bonds that would otherwise restrict the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

The closing of any offer to purchase, the operation of any indenture amendments, and any redemption of the existing notes, and the

redemption of any IRBs is required to be conditioned upon the occurrence of the closing of the Merger and the receipt by the Company of all
funds required to satisfy the offer to purchase, consent solicitation, and/or redemption(s). Currently, the Company and Parent do not expect that
the IRBs will be redeemed.

 
Employee Matters
 

Parent is required to cause the surviving corporation and each of its subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the effective time of the
Merger and ending on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain the severance-related provisions, as in effect on the date of the Merger
Agreement, of existing written Company benefit plans and to provide 100% of any severance payments and benefits required thereunder to be
provided any Company employee terminated during that 12-month period.

 
Furthermore, Parent must cause the surviving corporation and each of its subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the effective time

of the Merger and ending on December 31, 2017, to provide for any Company employee, cash compensation levels that are each no less
favorable than, and other benefits that in the aggregate are substantially comparable to, the overall cash compensation levels and benefits
maintained for and provided to such Company employees immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, excluding equity and equity-
based compensation.

 
As of and after the effective time of the Merger, Parent must, or must cause the surviving corporation to, give Company employees full

credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for purposes of benefit accruals except for vacation pay and severance purposes),
under any employee compensation, incentive, and benefit (including vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the
benefit of Company employees as of and after the effective time of the Merger by Parent, its subsidiaries or the surviving corporation for the
Company employees’ service with the Company, its subsidiaries and their predecessor entities to the same extent recognized by the Company
immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger under an analogous Company benefit plan. With respect to each Parent plan that is a
“welfare benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent and its subsidiaries are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and
maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Company employees under similar
plans maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger.

 
From and after the effective time of the Merger, except as otherwise agreed in writing between Parent and a Company employee or as

otherwise provided in the Merger Agreement, Parent must honor, and will cause its subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms, (i) each
existing written employment, severance and termination protection plan, policy or agreement of or between the Company or any of its
subsidiaries and any officer or employee of the Company or such subsidiary, (ii) all obligations in effect as of the effective time of the Merger
under any written bonus or bonus deferral plans, programs or agreements of the Company or its subsidiaries and (iii) all vested and accrued
benefits under any employee benefit, employment

Director and Officer Indemnification
 

All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the
Merger and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of certain indemnitees as provided in the respective
articles of incorporation or by-laws or other organizational documents of the Company or any subsidiary or any indemnification agreement
between such indemnitee and the Company or any of its subsidiaries will survive the Merger and, for a period of six years after the effective
time of the Merger Agreement, will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such indemnitee.

 
From and after the effective time of the Merger, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation,

whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the
indemnitee is or was a director (including in a capacity as a member of any board committee), or officer of the Company, any of its subsidiaries
or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) the Merger Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby, whether in any case
asserted or arising before or after the effective time of the Merger, Parent and the surviving corporation will indemnify and hold harmless, to
the fullest extent permitted by law and the organizational documents of the Company or its applicable subsidiary, each such indemnitee against
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any such proceeding), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or actual claim. Parent’s
and the surviving corporation’s obligations with respect to indemnification will continue in full force and effect for a period of six years after
the effective time.

 
Directors’ and Officers’ Insurance
 

The Company is required to obtain, at or prior to the effective time of the Merger, prepaid or “tail” directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the Merger for six years from the effective time,
covering each person who is covered by such tail policies on February 16, 2017, and certain other individuals set forth on the Company’s
disclosure schedule on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policies in effect on February 16,
2017. Such tail policies may not be amended, modified or cancelled or revoked by the Company, Parent, Intermediate Co or the surviving
corporation. If the Company does not obtain such “tail” policies, then for a period of six years from the effective time of the Merger, Parent and
Intermediate Co will be required to maintain in effect the Company’s current directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies, covering each
indemnified party on terms with respect to coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than those of the policies in effect on
February 16, 2017. Neither Parent, Intermediate Co, nor the surviving corporation is required to pay an aggregate annual premium for such
insurance policy (whether or not a “tail” policy is obtained) in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company in its last full fiscal
year for such insurance coverage. If the annual premium amount exceeds such amount, Parent,

or the Parent may extend the Outside Date until September 29, 2017 if the reason the Merger has not been consummated by
the Outside Date is due to the fact that certain regulatory approvals or the Shareholder Approval have not yet been obtained;
however, such right of termination is not available to any party if the failure of such party to perform any of its obligations
under the Merger Agreement has been a primary cause of the failure of the Merger to be consummated on or before such

party; provided that neither party has such right of termination if it is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants, or other agreements under the Merger Agreement which breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure
of any of the conditions to closing applicable to the other party;

 
● by Parent if the Shareholder Approval has not been obtained, and:

 
○ if the Board of Directors or any committee effects a Change of Recommendation;

 
○ if the Company failed to include in this proxy statement, when mailed, the Board of Directors’ recommendation that our

Break-Up Fees
 

The Company will pay to or cause to be paid to or as directed by Parent a break-up fee (if a break-up fee has not already been paid
pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement) in the event that:

 
● a Change in Recommendation Termination or Alternative Acquisition Termination occurs; or

 
● a Company Breach Termination occurs or the Merger Agreement is terminated because the Merger has not been consummated by the

Outside Date at a time when a Company Breach Termination was available and, in either case, within twelve months following such
termination, the Company either (i) consummates an acquisition transaction that results in a change of control or (ii) enters into a letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding or other contract with respect to an acquisition transaction that results in a change of control
that is ultimately consummated, whether or not such consummation occurs within twelve months following such termination.

 
The amount of the break-up fee would have been $10.0 million upon certain termination events associated with a superior proposal

arising from the go-shop period, none of which occurred. The amount of the break-up fee is $15 million under any other circumstances in
which a break-up fee is payable.

 
Fees Payable by LMI
 

The Company is responsible for paying the filing, printing and mailing fees and expenses associated with this proxy statement.
 
The Parent is required to reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’

fees) incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with their cooperation with Parent’s arrangement of the debt financing or
alternative financing, and for all documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Company
in connection with its cooperation pursuant to (i) an offer to purchase and/or consent solicitation with respect to, or a redemption of, the
existing notes, and (ii) a redemption of the IRBs.

 
The Parent is also responsible for 100% of the filing fees payable to the FTC, the Antitrust Division, CFIUS, or any other

governmental entity in connection with the antitrust, competition, or trade regulation matters contemplated by the Merger Agreement.
 
All other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the transactions contemplated thereby

will be paid by the party incurring or required to incur such fees or expenses, except as otherwise provided herein.
 

Amendment; Extension; Waiver
 

The Merger Agreement may be amended by written agreement of Parent, Sub and the Company at any time before or after receipt of
the Shareholder Approval; provided, that after the

Shareholder Approval has been obtained, there can be no amendment that by law would require further approval by our shareholders without
such approval having been obtained.

 
At any time prior to the effective time of the Merger, any party to the Merger Agreement may:
 

● extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other parties to the Merger Agreement;
 

● to the extent permitted by law, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party contained in the Merger
Agreement or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant to the Merger Agreement; or

 
● subject to the rights and restrictions on amendment described above, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions

contained in the Merger Agreement.
 

Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such party. The failure of the Company, Parent, Intermediate Co or Sub to exercise any of its rights under the Merger
Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a waiver by such party of such right.

 
Governing Law
 

The Merger Agreement and any litigation that may be directly or indirectly based upon, arise out of or relate to the Merger Agreement,
the Merger, or the negotiation, execution or performance thereof, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware; provided that the
MGBCL shall govern to the extent that the MGBCL is applicable to the Merger and the internal affairs of the Company (including the fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors of the Company and any determination regarding an acquisition proposal pursuant to such fiduciary duties).

 
Specific Performance
 

In the event of breach or threatened breach of any covenant or obligation in the Merger Agreement, the non-breaching party will be
entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to specific
performance and the issuance of immediate injunctive and other equitable relief without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy.

PROPOSAL 2: ADJOURNMENT OF THE SPECIAL MEETING

 
We are asking you to approve a proposal to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates if necessary or appropriate to solicit

additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the Merger Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated thereby at the time of the Special Meeting. If shareholders approve the adjournment proposal, we could adjourn the Special
Meeting and any adjourned session of the Special Meeting and use the additional time to solicit additional proxies, including proxies from
shareholders that have previously returned properly executed proxies voting against adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. Among other things, approval of the adjournment proposal could mean that, even if we
had received proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated thereby such that the proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement would be defeated, we could adjourn the Special
Meeting without a vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby
and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to vote in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby. Additionally, we may seek to adjourn the Special Meeting if a quorum is not present or
otherwise at the discretion of the chairman of the Special Meeting.

 
The Board of Directors, with Daniel G. Korte abstaining, unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY, NON-BINDING VOTE TO APPROVE

CERTAIN MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS
 

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of
2010, requires that we provide shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the payment of certain
compensation that will or may become payable to LMI’s named executive officers by LMI in connection with the Merger, as disclosed in the
section of this proxy statement captioned “The Merger — Interests of LMI’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden
Parachute Compensation.”

 
We are asking shareholders to indicate their approval of the various compensation that will or may become payable by LMI to LMI’s

named executive officers in connection with the Merger. These payments are set forth in the section of this proxy statement captioned “The
Merger — Interests of LMI’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger — Golden Parachute Compensation” and the accompanying
footnotes. These arrangements are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms.

 
Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the Special Meeting:
 

“RESOLVED, that the shareholders of LMI Aerospace, Inc. approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation that
will or may become payable to LMI’s named executive officers by LMI that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger as disclosed
pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned “The Merger — Interests of LMI’s Directors and Executive Officers
in the Merger — Golden Parachute Compensation” in LMI’s proxy statement for the Special Meeting.”

 
Shareholders should note that this proposal is not a condition to completion of the Merger, and as an advisory vote, the result will not

be binding on LMI, the Board of Directors or Parent. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their
terms, subject to shareholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the Merger is consummated, our named
executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or otherwise relates to the Merger in accordance with the terms
and conditions applicable to those payments.

 
The Board of Directors, with Daniel G. Korte abstaining, unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT

 
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock, as of April 10, 2017,

of each person or entity who we know to beneficially own 5% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock and all of our current
directors and executive officers as a group.

 
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by

a person, and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of our common stock subject to stock options held by that person that are
currently exercisable, or exercisable within 60 days of April 10, 2017, are deemed outstanding. Such shares, however, are not deemed
outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Unless otherwise indicated below, the address of each
beneficial owner listed in the table is 411 Fountain Lakes Boulevard, St. Charles, Missouri 63301.

 
The percentages in the table below are based on 13,701,350 shares of our common stock outstanding as of April 10, 2017. Except as

indicated in the footnotes to this table and pursuant to applicable community property laws, to our knowledge, each shareholder named in the
table has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares set forth opposite such shareholder’s name. The information provided in
this table is based on our records and information filed with the SEC, unless otherwise noted.

Under our bylaws, in order for a matter to be deemed properly presented by a shareholder, timely notice must be received by the Secretary of
the Company not later than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the date of the one-year anniversary of the date on which the Company
first mailed notice to shareholders for the preceding year’s annual meeting. To be timely for the 2017 annual meeting, a shareholder’s notice
must have been delivered to or mailed and received by the Corporate Secretary of the Company between December 17, 2016 and January 16,
2017. The Company did not receive any such notice during the permitted time period.

 
Nominations for the election of directors at an annual meeting may be made only (1) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors,

HOUSEHOLDING

 
Unless we have received contrary instructions, we may send a single copy of this proxy statement to any household at which two or

more shareholders reside if we believe the shareholders are members of the same family. Each shareholder in the household will continue to
receive a separate proxy card. This process, known as “householding,” reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household
and helps to reduce our expenses.

 
If you would like to receive your own set of our disclosure documents this year or in future years, follow the instructions described

below. Similarly, if you share an address with another shareholder and together both of you would like to receive only a single set of our
disclosure documents, follow these instructions.

 
If you are a shareholder of record, you may contact us by writing to LMI Aerospace, Inc., Attention: Corporate Secretary, 411

Fountain Lakes Boulevard, St. Charles, Missouri 63301 or calling our Corporate Secretary at (636) 946-6525. Eligible shareholders of record
receiving multiple copies of this proxy statement can request householding by contacting us in the same manner. If a bank, broker or other
nominee holds your shares, please contact your bank, broker or other nominee directly.

(b)          Exchange Procedures. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than

the second Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who
was, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any shares of Company Common Stock (each, a “Certificate”) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall otherwise
be in customary form), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each
holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed and in proper form, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. As promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to issue and deliver to each Person who was, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder
of uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented in book-entry form (“Book-Entry Shares”), other than with respect to shares
to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.01(b) and shares the holders of which have complied with each of clauses (i) and (ii) of Section
3.01(d), a check or wire transfer for the amount of cash which such Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted into the right to receive
pursuant to Section 3.01(c), without such holder being required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent,
and such Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, but only if such Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise is in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable; provided, however, that payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only
be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Each Book-Entry Share and, until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 3.03(b), each Certificate, shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
pursuant to this Article III, except for Certificates and Book-Entry Shares in respect of Appraisal Shares, which shall be deemed to represent
the right to receive the consideration due with respect to such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 3.01(d) to the extent provided by
Section 351.455 or the MGBCL. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to the provisions of this Article III.

 
(c)          No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates (or

automatically in the case of Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with the terms of this Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or such Book-Entry
Shares. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Share (other
than a Certificate or Book-Entry Share in respect of Appraisal Shares) is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled
against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this Article III.

(d)          Termination of the Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of

the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for nine months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable
for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, in each case without interest thereon and
subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 3.03(a) to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand.

 
(e)          No Liability. None of the Parent Entities, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be

liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with any applicable state,
federal or other abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the
related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 
(f)          Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;

provided, however, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A1 or P1
or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard & Poor’s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $5.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of
such bank that are then publicly available). Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to Parent.
Nothing contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to receive the Merger Consideration or any holder of a Company Equity Award to receive the holder’s Equity
Award Amount, in each case as provided herein. If for any reason (including investment losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund is insufficient to
fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder (but subject to Section 3.03(h)), Parent shall
promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy any
such cash payment obligations.

 
(g)          Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that

fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting
by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration.

(h)          Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parent Entities, the Company,

the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted or withheld, from any amount
otherwise payable pursuant to the Merger (or this Agreement) such amounts as they are required to deduct and withhold under applicable Tax
Law; provided, however, that in the event that any Parent Entity assigns its rights under this Agreement, no amounts will be withheld from any
payments in respect of Company Common Stock or Appraisal Shares to the extent such amounts would not have been required under
applicable Tax Law to be withheld absent any such assignment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 
Section 3.04     Company Equity Awards. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board

of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Incentive Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other
actions as may be required to terminate the Company Incentive Plans effective as of no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time and
to provide that the following actions shall occur:
 

(a)          Each Restricted Share that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be fully vested and, at the
Effective Time, canceled and extinguished and converted into the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 3.01(c).

 
(b)          Each RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be fully vested and settled in one (1)

share of Company Common Stock and, at the Effective Time, canceled and extinguished and converted into the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 3.01(c).

 
(c)          Payment in respect of all Restricted Shares and RSUs hereunder shall be subject to appropriate withholding for

Taxes in accordance with Section 3.03(h) and shall be paid by or on behalf of the Company not later than five (5) Business Days following the
date on which the Effective Time occurs. The term “Equity Award Amounts” means, collectively, all amounts payable with respect to
Restricted Shares and RSUs pursuant to this Section 3.04.

applicable Law) under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization except where the failure to be duly organized, validly existing or

limited liability company or other entity power and authority to own or lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as presently

Section 4.06     SEC Documents and Financial Statements; Internal Controls and Disclosure Controls.

 
(a)          The Company has filed all schedules, forms, statements, reports and other documents required to be filed by it with

the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act since January 1, 2015 (the schedules, forms, statements, reports and other
documents filed with or furnished to the SEC since January 1, 2015, collectively, the “SEC Documents”). As of their respective effective dates
(in the case of SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their
respective dates of filing (in the case of all other SEC Documents), or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of the last
such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date hereof, the SEC Documents complied, and each of the SEC Documents filed subsequent
to the date of this Agreement will comply, in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. As of the time of filing with the SEC, none of the SEC Documents so filed or that will be filed subsequent to the date of this
Agreement contained or will contain, as the case may be, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or will omit, as the case may be, to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent that the information in such SEC Document has been amended or superseded by a
later SEC Document filed prior to the date hereof. There has been no material correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, occurring since January 1, 2015 and prior to the date hereof that is not available to the
public on the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering and Retrieval database. As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments
in comment letters from the SEC staff with respect to any of the SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof,
none of the SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review, outstanding SEC comment or outstanding SEC investigation.

 
(b)          Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, the notes thereto) of the Company included in

the SEC Documents (i) have been prepared from, and in accordance with, the books and records of the Company and the Company’s
Subsidiaries in all material respects and (ii) when filed, complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) (except,
in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to the extent permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC or other rules and regulations of the SEC)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of footnotes). Since January 1, 2015, the Company has not received any written
advice or written notification from its independent certified public accountants that it has used any improper accounting practice that would
have the effect of not reflecting or incorrectly reflecting in the financial statements or in the books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, any properties, assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses in any material respect or have identified any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information.

(c)          Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding (nor has arranged or modified since the enactment

of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) any prohibited loans or “extensions of credit” (within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to
any director or executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has
been and is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of Nasdaq.

 
(d)          The Company has established and maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in and

in accordance with the requirements of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such internal controls provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Since January 1, 2015, the Company’s principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to
the Company’s auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors (i) all known significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the
Company’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, (ii) any known fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a role in the Company’s internal controls and the Company has made available to Parent copies of
any written materials relating to each of the foregoing. The Company has made available to Parent all such disclosures made by management to
the Company’s auditors and audit committee from January 1, 2015 to the date of this Agreement.

 
(e)          The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in and in

accordance with the requirements of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act), which disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed
to ensure that material information relating to the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries required to be included in reports filed under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure.

 
Section 4.07     No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except for matters reflected or reserved against in the most recent audited

consolidated balance sheet of the Company (or the notes thereto) included in the SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations (whether accrued, absolute, contingent, fixed or otherwise) of any nature
that would be required under GAAP, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company
(including the notes thereto) except liabilities and obligations that (a) were incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since the date of the most recent audited balance sheet, (b) are incurred in connection with the Transactions or (c) individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Other than as disclosed in Section 4.07 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any material
off balance sheet partnership, joint venture or any similar arrangement (including any Contract relating to any transaction or relationship
between or among the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any other Person, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose Person, on the other hand, or any “off-balance sheet arrangement” (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act)).

ARTICLE V.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARENT ENTITIES
 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered by the Parent Entities to the Company concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, the Parent Entities jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 
Section 5.01     Organization; Qualification. Each of the Parent Entities is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in

good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as
presently conducted, except where the failure to have such power and authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions, or the Parent Entities’ ability to observe and
perform their material obligations hereunder (the “Parent Material Adverse Effect”).
 

Section 5.02     Authority; Government Approvals; Non-Contravention.
 

(a)           Each of the Parent Entities has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and deliver this Agreement
and, subject to adoption of this Agreement by Intermediate Co as sole shareholder of Sub (which adoption will occur immediately following the
execution of this Agreement) and the filing of the Summary Articles of Merger pursuant to the MGBCL, to consummate the Transactions,
including the Merger. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of the Parent Entities, the consummation of the
Merger and the other Transactions and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement by each of the Parent Entities, have been duly and
validly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of each of the Parent Entities, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Parent Entities (including any direct or indirect shareholder action) on the part of the Parent Entities are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or to consummate the Transactions, including the Merger subject, in the case of filing the Summary Articles of Merger and
consummating the Merger, to approval of this Agreement by Intermediate Co as sole shareholder of Sub (which approval will occur
immediately following execution of this Agreement). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of the Parent Entities and,
assuming this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company, this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
agreement of the Parent Entities, enforceable against each of the Parent Entities in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to
bankruptcy, insolvency and other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and to general equitable
principles.

(b)           The execution, delivery and performance by the Parent Entities of this Agreement and the consummation of the

Merger and the other Transactions by the Parent Entities and compliance with the provisions hereof by the Parent Entities do not require any
consent, approval, order, waiver or authorization or permit of, action or non-action by, registration, declaration or filing with or notification to
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Parent Entities or any of their respective businesses or assets other than (i) the filing of the
Summary Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Missouri; (ii) compliance with the applicable requirements of the HSR
Act; (iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of ITAR, including sections 122.4 and 129.8; (iv) compliance with the applicable
requirements of the DPA in connection with satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 7.01(b)(iii); (v) compliance with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act; (vi) as disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule; and (vii) any such
consent, approval, order, waiver, authorization, permit, action, non-action, registration, declaration, filing or notification the failure of which to
make or obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 
(c)           The execution, delivery and performance by the Parent Entities of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of

the Merger and the other Transactions and compliance with the provisions hereof by the Parent Entities will not, (i) conflict with, or result in
any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, require consent under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of any benefit under any (A) Contract to which any of the Parent Entities is a party
or by which any of their respective properties, assets or rights are bound or (B) Authorization applicable to any of the Parent Entities, (ii) result
in the creation of any Liens upon any of the properties, assets or rights of any of the Parent Entities, (iii) conflict with or result in any violation
of any provision of the Organizational Documents of any of the Parent Entities or (iv) assuming that the consents and approvals referred to in
Section 5.02(b) are duly obtained and Intermediate Co consents to the approval of this Agreement as sole shareholder of Sub (which approval
will occur immediately following execution of this Agreement), conflict with or violate any applicable Laws or any judgments, orders, or
decrees of any Governmental Entity in each case applicable to the Parent Entities or any of their respective properties, assets or rights, other
than, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) and (iv), as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 
Section 5.03     Financing.

 
(a)           Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies, including all exhibits, schedules or

amendments thereto, of the fully executed (i) commitment letter, dated as of January 27, 2017, between Parent and SFPI-FPIM, and the
commitment letter, dated as of February 16, 2017, between Parent and Wespavia SA (the “Equity Commitment Letters”), pursuant to which
each of SFPI-FPIM and Wespavia SA has committed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to invest in and/or advance
to Parent the cash amounts set forth in the Equity Commitment Letters (the “Equity Financing”), and (ii) commitment letter, dated as of the
date of this Agreement, among Parent, ING Bank N.V., BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV and ING Belgium SA/NV (the “Debt Commitment Letter,”
and together with the Equity Commitment Letters, the “Financing Commitments”), pursuant to which the Lender Parties have committed,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to lend to Parent the amounts set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (the “Debt
Financing” and together with the Equity Financing, the “Financing”).

(b)           None of the Financing Commitments has been amended or modified prior to the date of this Agreement, and, as of

the date of this Agreement, the respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been modified, withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded in any respect. As of the date hereof, except for (i) the fee letter among Parent and ING Bank N.V., as coordinator and
ING Belgium SA/NV as original underwriter (the “Debt Fee Letter”) and (ii) the Financing Commitments, there are no other agreements, side
letters or arrangements to which any of the Parent Entities is a party relating to the funding or investing of the Financing. As of the date hereof,
the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and constitute the legally valid and binding obligations of Parent, as applicable, and, to
the knowledge of Parent, the other parties to the Financing Commitments subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency and other
Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally and to general equity principles (whether considered in a
proceeding on equity or at law). There are no conditions precedent between Parent on the one hand, and any other party to the Financing
Commitments or the Debt Fee Letter, on the other hand, related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set
forth in the Financing Commitments. Assuming (i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement are true and correct
(without regard, in the case of the representations contained in Section 4.07 (No Undisclosed Liabilities), to any qualification by or reference to
“Company Material Adverse Effect”), (ii) the Company has performed and complied with its covenants under this Agreement, (iii) the
conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied and (iv) the Financing is funded in accordance with the Financing Commitments, the
proceeds to be disbursed pursuant to the agreements contemplated by the Financing Commitments, in the aggregate, will be sufficient for
Parent to pay, or cause to be paid, the Merger Consideration and all related fees and expenses at the Closing and to provide for any required
repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which would result
in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) by Parent
under the Financing Commitments, or give rise to circumstances which would mean that one or more conditions precedent under the Financing
Commitments would not or could not as of the Closing Date be satisfied, and Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Financing Commitments will not be timely satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date.
Parent has fully paid all commitment fees and other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to the Financing
Commitments and will pay, or cause to be paid, in full all amounts due on or before the Closing Date.

 
(c)           Notwithstanding anything herein, the Parent Entities expressly acknowledge and agree that their respective

obligations to consummate the Transactions are not subject to any condition or contingency with respect to receipt of the Financing or any
financing or funding by any third party.

Section 5.04     Litigation. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Litigation pending or, to the knowledge of Parent,

threatened against the Parent Entities, or any of their respective Affiliates that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no Order outstanding against the Parent Entities, or any of their respective Affiliates
that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
 

Section 5.05     Information Supplied. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of the Parent
Entities or any of their Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the
shareholders of the Company and at the time of the Shareholders’ Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.
 

Section 5.06     Operation and Ownership of Sub. Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions
and, prior to the Effective Time, will not have engaged in any business activities, other than activities pursuant to this Agreement, the
performance of its obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto. As of the date of this Agreement, Intermediate Co owns, and at the
Effective Time Intermediate Co and/or one or more Subsidiaries of Parent will own, beneficially and of record, all the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Sub, free and clear of all Liens.
 

Section 5.07     Brokers and Other Advisors. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other Person, other than
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, is entitled to any broker’s, finder’s or financial
advisor’s fee or commission in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the
Parent Entities or their Affiliates.
 

Section 5.08     Ownership of Company Common Stock. None of the Parent Entities or any of their Affiliates beneficially
own (within the meaning of Section 13 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder), five percent or more of the
Company Common Stock as of the date of this Agreement.

(b)           Except as may relate to any Qualified Purchaser (but only for as long as such Person or group is a Qualified

Purchaser) or as expressly permitted by this Section 6.02, after the Go-Shop Period End Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement, the Company shall not and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and the Company shall direct its and their
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of providing information)
the submission or making of any requests, inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal or engage in, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto or
otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate, any such requests, proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations or furnish to
any Person any nonpublic information in furtherance of or afford access to the books or records or directors, officers, employees or other
Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person with respect to, any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to result in any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) except as expressly permitted by Section 6.02(f), approve, endorse or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any confidentiality agreement,
merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, purchase agreement, option agreement or other agreement providing for or relating to
an Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement as set forth in, and if permitted pursuant to, the provisions of
Section 6.02(c)) or enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Transactions or breach its obligations hereunder or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing; (iii) take any action to make the provisions of
any Takeover Law inapplicable to any transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal; (iv) terminate, amend, release, modify or fail to
enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or request under, any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by
the Company in respect of or in contemplation of an Acquisition Proposal (other than, until the receipt of the Shareholder Approval, to the
extent the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that failure to take any of
such actions under this clause (iv) would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the holders of Company
Common Stock under applicable Law), or (v) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing. Except as may relate to any Qualified Purchaser or
as expressly permitted by this Section 6.02, the Company shall, shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall cause its and their Representatives to
immediately cease and terminate, any solicitation, knowing encouragement, discussion or negotiation or cooperation with, or assistance or
participation in, or facilitation of any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations with, any Persons conducted heretofore by the
Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and promptly request and instruct the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished to any such Person, and the Company shall take all reasonably
necessary actions to secure its rights and ensure the performance of any such Person’s obligations under any applicable confidentiality
agreement. The Company shall ensure that its Representatives are aware of the provisions of this Section 6.02, and any violation of the
restrictions contained in this Section 6.02 by its Board of Directors (including any committee thereof) or its Representatives (to the extent such
Representatives have been directed or authorized by the Company or its Board of Directors to take or fail to take such action in violation of
such restrictions) shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.02 by the Company; provided, however, that any actions taken by the
Company’s Board of Directors (including any committee thereof) or its Representatives that would be deemed a breach of the first two
sentences of this Section 6.02(b) had the Company taken such action shall be deemed a breach by the Company solely for purposes of
determining whether an Acquisition Proposal resulted from a breach of the first two sentences of this Section 6.02(b).

(c)           Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.02(b) or any other provisions of this Agreement, if

at any time following the Go-Shop Period End Date and prior to the date and time on which Shareholder Approval is obtained, (i) the Company
has received an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the Board of Directors determines in good faith to be bona fide,
(ii) such Acquisition Proposal did not result in any material respect from a breach of the first two sentences of Section 6.02(b), (iii) the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (x) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take the actions described in clauses (A) and
(B) below would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Board of Directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the
Company may (A) enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Company to the
Person making the Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
regarding such Acquisition Proposal; provided, that the Company shall give written notice to Parent after any such determination by the Board
of Directors and before taking any of the actions described in the foregoing clauses (A) and (B). The Company shall concurrently provide
Parent with copies of any information or materials provided or made available to such other Person which was not previously made available to
Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the occurrence of the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company may continue to engage in
the activities described in Section 6.02(a) (subject to the limitations and obligations set forth therein) with respect to, and the restrictions in
Section 6.02(b) and Section 6.02(c) shall not apply to, any Qualified Purchaser (but only for so long as such Person or group is a Qualified
Purchaser), including with respect to any amended or modified Acquisition Proposal submitted by any Qualified Purchaser following the Go-
Shop Period End Date.

 
(d)           Except as may relate to a Qualified Purchaser, following the Go-Shop Period End Date, the Company shall

promptly notify Parent if it takes any action described in clauses (A) and (B) of Section 6.02(c), which notice shall include the identity of the
Person making the Acquisition Proposal and a copy of the Acquisition Proposal to which such action relates (if made in writing) or the material
terms and conditions thereof (if not made in writing). Except as may relate to a Qualified Purchaser, following the Go-Shop Period End Date,
the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed (orally or in writing) on a prompt basis (and in any event within forty-eight 48 hours) of
any material developments, material discussions or material negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal described in the immediately
preceding sentence and, upon the reasonable request of Parent, shall apprise Parent of the status of any discussions or negotiations with respect
thereto. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any agreement that would prohibit
them from providing such information or the information contemplated by the last sentence of Section 6.02(a) to Parent.

(e)           The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any

Person relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal subsequent to the date of this Agreement except for an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement as permitted or required pursuant to this Section 6.02, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be party to any
agreement that prohibits the Company from providing to Parent any information provided or made available to any other Person pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

 
(f)            From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this

Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.01, and except as otherwise provided for in the immediately following sentence, neither the
Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or
modify in any manner the Recommendation; (ii) if a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of capital stock of the Company that constitutes
an Acquisition Proposal is commenced, fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the shareholders of the
Company (including, for these purposes, by taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the
holders of Company Common Stock, which shall constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer)
within ten (10) Business Days after commencement thereof pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act; (iii) approve or recommend or
propose publicly to approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, or execute any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition or other agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (any of the actions specified in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) a “Change of Recommendation”).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Board of Directors may at any time prior to the time Shareholder Approval has been
obtained, (A) effect a Change of Recommendation if, as a result of an event, development or change in circumstances that first occurs, arises or
becomes known after the date of this Agreement (other than the receipt, existence or terms of any Acquisition Proposal, which is subject to
clause (B) below, or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof), the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the holders of Company Common Stock under applicable Law or (B) effect a Change of Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement to enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement, in each case described in this clause (B), with respect to a Superior
Proposal, if (1) the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the
terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause (ii) below, and (2) the Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the holders of Company Common Stock under applicable Law; provided, however, that, in the case of
the foregoing clauses (A) and (B) the Board of Directors may not effect or make a Change of Recommendation or, as applicable, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.02(f) and Section 8.01(f) unless, in the case of clause (B) above, such Superior Proposal did not result in
any material respect from a breach by the Company of the first two sentences of Section 6.02(b), and, in the case of clauses (A) and (B) above:

 
(i)          the Company shall have provided prior written notice to the Parent Entities of its intention to effect or make

a Change of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement as contemplated by this Section 6.02(f) at least four Business
Days in advance of taking such action (the “Notice Period”), which notice shall include, in the case of clause (B) above, an
unredacted copy of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal), and shall
have contemporaneously provided a copy of then-current form of all relevant transaction agreements relating to such Superior
Proposal (and any debt and equity financing materials related thereto that were provided to the Company); and

(ii)         prior to effecting or making a Change of Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into a

proposed definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, (x) the Company shall have negotiated, and shall have
directed its Representatives to negotiate, during the Notice Period, with the Parent Entities in good faith (to the extent the
Parent Entities desire to negotiate) to make adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (y) the Board of
Directors shall have considered in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) any
adjustments to this Agreement submitted in writing by the Parent Entities during the Notice Period, and (z) the Board of
Directors shall have determined in good faith that, after giving effect to such adjustments, the Superior Proposal still
constitutes a Superior Proposal (in the case of clause (B) above) or it would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the holders of Company Common Stock under applicable Law to not effect a Change in Recommendation.

 
In the event of any material revision to the terms of any such Superior Proposal or any Acquisition Proposal that the Company’s Board of
Directors determines no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal, including any change in any price term thereof, the Company shall be required
to deliver a new written notice to the Parent Entities and to again comply with the requirements of this Section 6.02(f) with respect to such new
written notice, and a new Notice Period shall commence with respect to such notice (except that the reference to “four Business Days” in the
definition of Notice Period shall be deemed to be a reference to “two Business Days”).
 

(g)         Subject to the provision in this Section 6.02(g), nothing contained in this Section 6.02 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company, the Board of Directors or any committee of the Board of Directors from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S.
federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to shareholders in connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer), or (ii) making any “stop-
look-and-listen” communication to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the shareholders of the Company); provided, however, that any disclosure permitted under clause (i) of this Section 6.02(g)
shall be deemed a Change of Recommendation unless it includes either an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or an
express reaffirmation of the Recommendation. The Company shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal or any
Superior Proposal prior to the termination of this Agreement.

(h)         For purposes of this Agreement:
 

(i)          “Acquisition Proposal” means any inquiry, offer or proposal from any Person that is structured to permit
such Person (other than the Parent Entities or their respective Affiliates) to acquire, directly or indirectly and in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions, (1) 15% or more (based on the fair market value, as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors) of the assets (including capital stock of the Subsidiaries of the Company) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, (2) shares of Company Common Stock which, together with any other shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by such Person, would be equal to 15% or more of the issued and outstanding
shares of the Company Common Stock or any other class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (3)
any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person owning, directly or indirectly, shares of
Company Common Stock equal to 15% or more of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock or any
other equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (4) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
binding share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any Person
(or the shareholders of any Person) would own, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the aggregate voting power of the
Company or of the surviving entity in a merger or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving
entity, or (5) any recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or any other similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
material operating Subsidiaries, other than, in each case, the Transactions.

 
(ii)         “Qualified Purchaser” means any Person or group of Persons from whom the Company or any of its

Representatives has received prior to the Go-Shop Period End Date a written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors
determines in good faith (such determination to be made no later than four (4) Business Days after the Go-Shop Period End
Date), after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, is or could reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal.

 
(iii)        “Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not result in any material

respect from a violation of the first two sentences of Section 6.02(b) that the Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) (x) is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms and the financing of which is fully committed or reasonably likely to be obtained, and (y) would be
more favorable to the shareholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account all
terms and conditions thereof (including all financial, legal, financing, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition
Proposal (including the person or group making the Acquisition Proposal, the financing terms thereof, the expected timing
and risk and likelihood of consummation)) and of this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by the Parent Entities pursuant to Section 6.02(f)); provided, that for purposes of the definition of “Superior
Proposal,” the references to “15%” in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to “66.66%”.

promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) are otherwise used for the “solicitation” of “proxies” as those terms are defined in Rule 14a-1
promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each case prior to the filing thereof with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to the Company’s
shareholders and shall give good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent or its counsel, but the Company shall not be obligated to
incorporate any such comment.

 
(b)           Covenants of Parent with Respect to the Proxy Statement. Parent shall provide to the Company all information

concerning the Parent Entities as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement and shall otherwise
assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the Proxy Statement and resolution of comments of the SEC or its staff related

(c)           Mailing of Proxy Statement. The Company, acting through the Board of Directors, shall, as promptly as practicable

after the SEC, orally or in writing, confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement (or the SEC notifies the Company that it
does not intend to review the Proxy Statement or any waiting period during which the SEC may comment on the Proxy Statement expires), (x)
establish a record date (if not previously established) for and give notice of a meeting of its shareholders, for the purpose of voting upon the
approval of this Agreement (the “Shareholders’ Meeting”), and (y) mail to the holders of Company Common Stock as of the record date
established for the Shareholders’ Meeting the Proxy Statement in definitive form (the date the Company elects to take such action or is required
to take such action, the “Proxy Date”). The Company shall duly call, convene and hold the Shareholders’ Meeting as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Proxy Date, provided, that in no event shall such meeting be held later than 35 calendar days following the date the Proxy
Statement is mailed to the Company’s shareholders and any postponements or adjournments of such meetings shall require the prior written
consent of the Parent unless (i) the postponement or adjournment is required to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of
any supplemental or amended disclosure which the SEC or its staff has instructed the Company is necessary under applicable Law or which the
Company in good faith believes is otherwise required under applicable Law and is permitted under Section 6.02(g)(i), and to permit such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Company’s shareholders prior to the Shareholders’ Meeting, (ii)
the postponement or adjournment is in order to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Shareholder Approval or (iii) as of the
time for which the Shareholders’ Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Shareholders’
Meeting. Once the Company has established a record date for the Shareholders’ Meeting, the Company shall not change such record date or
establish a different record date for the Shareholders’ Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by
applicable Law or the Company’s bylaws. Unless the Board of Directors shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified its Recommendation
thereof or otherwise effected a Change of Recommendation, in each case in accordance with Section 6.02(f), the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts, consistent with customary practice, to solicit proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and shall ensure that all proxies
solicited in connection with the Shareholders’ Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws and all rules of Nasdaq. Without the
prior written consent of Parent, the approval of this Agreement and the Transactions (including the Merger) shall be the only matter (other than
procedural matters) which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders of the Company at the Shareholders’ Meeting.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 8.01, the Company shall submit
the Merger and this Agreement for the approval of the shareholders at the Shareholders’ Meeting whether or not a Change of Recommendation
shall have occurred or an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise made known to the Company, its Board of
Directors, its Representatives or its shareholders.

(d)           Amendments to Proxy Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to the

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective officers or directors should be discovered by the Company which, pursuant to the
Securities Act or Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, they shall promptly inform
Parent. Each of the Parent Entities and the Company agree to correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall
have become false or misleading. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause all documents that such party is responsible for filing with the
SEC in connection with the Merger to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act.

 
(e)           Other. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges

and agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall not (except as provided in Section 6.02(f)) be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company or any other Person of an Acquisition Proposal.

 
Section 6.04     Reasonable Best Efforts; Approvals.

 
(a)           Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and the Parent Entities, on

all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such parties or their
Subsidiaries with respect to the Transactions, including by providing all information that the other party may reasonably request in connection
therewith (except for documents filed pursuant to Items 4(c), 4(d)(ii) and 4(d)(iii) of the Notification and Report Form For Certain Mergers And
Acquisitions or communications regarding the same), and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII, to consummate the Transactions as
promptly as practicable and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other parties to obtain) any consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or
any exemption by, any Governmental Entity that is required to be obtained by them or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with
the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and to comply with the terms and conditions of any such consent, authorization, Order or approval.
Parent shall bear 100% of the filing fees payable to the FTC, the Antitrust Division, CFIUS or any other Governmental Entity in connection
with the antitrust, competition or trade regulation matters contemplated by this Agreement.

 
(b)           In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing (but subject to Section 6.04(f)), each of the Parent Entities,

on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, undertakes and agrees to file (i) within fifteen (15) Business Days following the date
hereof, a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice (the “Antitrust Division”), and (ii) as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof,
such other filings with any other Governmental Entities as may be required under any other applicable Antitrust Laws, to the extent set forth on
Section 6.04(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Each of the Parent Entities and the Company, as applicable, shall (x) respond as promptly
as practicable to any inquiries or requests for additional information or documentation received from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or such
other Governmental Entity, and (y) not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws or enter into any agreement
with the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any such other Governmental Entity not to consummate the Transactions, except with the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c)           In furtherance of and not in limitation of Sections 6.04(a) and Section 6.04(b) and subject to Section 6.04(g), Parent

and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate to (i) jointly submit a draft and a final notice with CFIUS regarding the

communications with, and requests for additional information from CFIUS. Subject to applicable Law or requests of CFIUS,
Parent and the Company shall provide each other’s counsel with an opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other party in connection with, the CFIUS Filing and any written communications or submissions, and
with respect to any such notification, filing, written communication or submission, any documents submitted therewith to
CFIUS; provided, that materials may be redacted or withheld (A) as necessary to comply with contractual agreements and
applicable Law, (B) as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns (it being understood that trade
secrets or other confidential intellectual property shall be shared between the parties on an outside counsel only basis) and (C)
to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and its Subsidiaries (it being understood that the terms of this
proviso shall in no way limit the information that would be required by this Agreement to be shared with CFIUS or any other
Governmental Entity). Subject to applicable Law, the reasonable requests of CFIUS and timing considerations, the Company
and Parent will consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of the Company or Parent relating
to CFIUS proceedings.

 
(iii)        As consistent with any CFIUS requests for confidentiality, each party shall cooperate and each party shall

have the opportunity to attend (or have its representatives participate) in any meetings with CFIUS member agencies, attend

Company shall timely submit the appropriate 60-day Pre Notification and 5-day Notification (the “ITAR Filing”) to the Directorate of Defense
Trade Controls (“DDTC”) of ITAR, in compliance with ITAR §122.4(a)-(b). The Company shall draft and submit the ITAR Filing, but shall
permit Parent to review, prior to submission, the ITAR Filing and the Company shall consider in good faith the written comments of Parent on
the ITAR Filing and all documents and submission materials relating thereto. Parent and the Company hereby agree promptly to provide and
cause their respective Affiliates to provide to the other party or to the DDTC, as appropriate, all information and other assistance necessary to

(h)           The Company and Parent shall give (or cause its respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties (other

than Governmental Entities), and use, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents from third
parties (other than Governmental Entities) that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Transactions; provided, however (but
without limiting the foregoing obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain such
consent), neither the failure to obtain any such consents or the termination of any Contract as a result thereof shall, by itself or in combination
with other such failures or terminations, result in the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII. In the event that either party shall fail to
obtain any third party consent described in the first sentence of this Section 6.04(h), each of the parties shall cooperate to minimize any adverse
effect upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be
expected to result, after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than any Governmental Entity) with respect to the Transactions,
(i) without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose
approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to
such Person and (ii) none of the Parent Entities shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being
solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than any Governmental Entity) with
respect to the Transactions, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose
approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to
such Person; provided, that Parent shall reimburse the Company for any payments made with Parent’s prior written consent in accordance with
this Section 6.04(h) prior to the Effective Time; provided, further, that the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company shall, upon
the direction of the Parent Entities and subject to prompt reimbursement by Parent, so pay or commit to pay all such amounts required.

 
Section 6.05     Takeover Law. If any Takeover Law shall become or is deemed to be applicable to the Merger or the other

Transactions after the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent and the members of their respective boards of directors (or equivalent
governing body) shall grant such approvals and use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions necessary so that the Merger and the other
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act to eliminate if possible, and
otherwise to minimize, the effects of such Takeover Law on the Merger and the other Transactions and this Agreement.
 

Section 6.06     Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each
other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statement with respect to the Merger or the other
Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or public statement prior to such consultation, except as otherwise may be required by
applicable Law, court process or Nasdaq rule, regulation or listing agreement. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the Merger and the other Transactions shall be in the form mutually agreed to by the parties.

Section 6.07     Indemnification and Insurance.

 
(a)           All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the

Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Person who is or prior to the Effective Time
becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, a director or officer of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective predecessors (each, an “Indemnified Party”) as provided in the Company’s Organizational Documents, the Organizational
Documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 
(b)          Without limiting Section 6.07(a), from and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual claim,

suit, action, proceeding or investigation (a “Claim”), whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole
or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director (including in a capacity as a member of any board
committee), or officer of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify
and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by Law and the Company’s or its applicable Subsidiary’s Organizational Documents in
effect at the Effective Time, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, Damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorney’s fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation of each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted by Law and the Company’s or its applicable Subsidiary’s Organizational Documents in effect at the Effective Time
upon receipt of any undertaking from such Indemnified Party contemplated by applicable Law or such Organizational Documents with respect
to repayment of advancement), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or actual Claim.
Parent’s and the Surviving Corporation’s obligations under this Section 6.07(b) shall continue in full force and effect for a period or six (6)
years after from the Effective Time provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim.

 
(c)           The Company shall obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or “tail”) directors’ and officers’ liability

insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six years from the Effective Time, covering
each person who is covered by such policies on the date of this Agreement, and the individuals set forth on Section 6.07(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule for their services disclosed on such schedule, on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable in the
aggregate than those of such policies in effect on the date of this Agreement; such tail policy may not be amended, modified or cancelled or
revoked by the Company, Parent, Intermediate Co or the Surviving Corporation. In the event the Company does not obtain such “tail” insurance
policies, then, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent and Intermediate Co shall maintain in effect the Company’s current
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each
Indemnified Party on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than those of such policies in effect on
the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that neither Parent, Intermediate Co nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an
aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for coverage for its last
full fiscal year for such insurance (which amount the Company represents and warrants is set forth in Section 6.07(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter); and provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent, Intermediate Co
or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d)          From and after the Effective Time, in the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)

consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its stock, properties or assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the
Surviving Corporation, Intermediate Co or Parent, respectively, shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors or assigns or
transferees, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.07.

 
(e)           From and after the Effective Time (but not prior thereto), the provisions of this Section 6.07 (i) are intended to be

for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her Representatives and (ii) are in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 
Section 6.08     Access; Confidentiality.

shall (i) afford to Parent, and to Parent’s Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours and on reasonable notice to all of its
and its Subsidiaries’ properties, books and records and to those directors, officers and employees of the Company to whom Parent reasonably
requests access, (ii) furnish, as promptly as practicable, to Parent all information concerning its and its Subsidiaries’ business, properties,
Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel, books and records and financial information and other aspects of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent may reasonably request, (iii) reasonably cooperate with Parent and its Representatives to organize and facilitate meetings among Parent
and its Representatives and the Company’s Representatives to be located at the properties, offices or other facilities of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries at such times during normal business hours as Parent may reasonably request, (iv) use reasonable best efforts to furnish
or produce information related to the financial or Tax records of the Company and its Subsidiaries if reasonably requested by Parent or its
Representatives and (v) reasonably cooperate with Parent and Parent’s Representatives with respect to communications to, and to organize and
facilitate meetings with, customers, suppliers and other key business relations of the Company and each Subsidiary of the Company as Parent
may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide any such access or information to the
extent that doing so, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, would (A) cause a waiver of an attorney-client privilege or loss of attorney
work product protection or (B) constitute a violation of any applicable Law (including Antitrust Laws) (in each case, it being agreed that the
Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such access or information and thereafter the Company and Parent shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause such access or information, as applicable, to be provided, or made available, in a manner
that would not reasonably be expected to cause such a waiver or violation).

(b)          All information received from the Company or its Representatives under Section 6.08(a) shall be subject to the

Confidentiality Agreement.
 
Section 6.09     Notification of Certain Matters. Each party hereto shall give prompt written notice to the other of (a) any

Litigation arising out of or relating to the Transactions or (b) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any change, effect, event, change in
circumstance, occurrence or discovery of any fact that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to
the obligations of any party to effect the Merger set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied; provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 6.09 shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty, breach of covenant or failure to satisfy the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice;
provided, further, that failure to give prompt notice pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 6.09 shall not constitute a failure of a condition to the
obligations of any party to effect the Merger set forth in Article VII except to the extent that the underlying fact or circumstance not so notified
standing alone constitutes such a failure.
 

Section 6.10     Financing.
 
(a)           The Parent Entities shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be

done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing
Commitments, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments, in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions thereof (it being further understood and agreed that Parent may not amend, supplement, modify or waive any provision
of Financing Commitments in any way that would reasonably be expected to adversely impact or delay in any material respect the ability of the
Parent Entities to consummate the Merger in accordance with this Agreement or the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Commitments as in effect on the date hereof), (ii) timely negotiate all definitive documents evidencing the Financing, timely satisfy
all conditions to the Financing and otherwise consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, and (iii) enforce the Financing
Commitments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (including the foregoing provisions of this Section
6.10(a)), in no event shall the obligations of the Parent Entities hereunder be construed to require any Parent Entity or any of their Affiliates to
enforce by litigation any of its rights pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitment or otherwise against any of Parent’s Debt Financing sources.

(b)           Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts

to obtain and consummate the Debt Financing. Parent shall furnish correct and complete copies of all definitive agreements entered into by
Parent (or any of the Parent Entities) with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter to the Company promptly upon their execution, provided that
the same pricing terms, fee amounts and economic terms redacted from the Debt Fee Letter provided to the Company may be redacted from
such definitive agreements. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, the Parent Entities shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any
such alternative Debt Financing, “Alternative Debt Financing”); provided, that any such Alternative Debt Financing shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Company (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing available on the Closing Date or the length of the
commitment therefor, from that contemplated by the Debt Financing Letter as in effect on the date hereof, (ii) expand upon the conditions
precedent to the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Financing Letter as in effect on the date hereof or (iii) in any way reasonably be

furnish correct and complete copies of all definitive agreements relating to the Alternative Debt Financing to the Company promptly upon their
execution, provided that the pricing terms, fee amounts and economic terms contained in the agreements governing the Alternative Debt
Financing that correspond to such terms that were redacted from the Debt Fee Letter provided to the Company may also be redacted from such
definitive agreements. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
obtain and consummate the Alternative Debt Financing. In the event Alternative Debt Financing is arranged in accordance with this Section
6.10(b), the term “Financing Commitments” shall mean the commitment letter(s) for such Alternative Debt Financing.

Parent of any material error, mistake or omission in the information provided pursuant to this Section 6.10(c) that it becomes aware of and if
requested by Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to promptly correct such error, mistake or omission. Nothing contained in this Section
6.10(c) or otherwise shall require the Company to be an issuer or other obligor with respect to the Financing prior to the Closing.

 
(d)           Parent shall, regardless of whether the Closing shall occur, (i) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its

Subsidiaries from and against any liability or obligation suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing
or the Alternative Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries provided by the Company or its Subsidiaries in writing specifically for use in the Financing offering documents);
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply in the event of the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’, or any of their respective
Representatives’, willful misconduct or gross negligence and (ii) promptly upon the Company’s request, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection
with its compliance with Section 6.10(c).

Section 6.15     Employment and Employee Benefits Matters.

 
(a)           Without limiting any additional rights that any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the

Effective Time (each, a “Company Employee”) may have under any Company Benefit Plan (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
employment or severance agreement), and except as otherwise agreed in writing between Parent and a Company Employee, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary
thereof, to maintain the severance-related provisions, as in effect on the date hereof, of existing written Company Benefit Plans disclosed on
Section 4.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and to provide 100% of any severance payments and benefits required thereunder to be
provided any Company Employee terminated during that 12-month period.

 
(b)          Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have under any Company Benefit Plan

(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any employment or severance agreement), and except as otherwise agreed in writing between Parent and
a Company Employee, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective

opportunities and commissions rates) that are each no less favorable than, and (ii) other benefits (including the costs thereof to Company
Benefit Plan participants) that in the aggregate are substantially comparable to, the overall cash compensation levels and benefits (including the
costs thereof to Company Benefit Plan participants), respectively, maintained for and provided to such Company Employees immediately prior
to the Effective Time, excluding equity and equity-based compensation for purposes of the comparison under clause (ii).

 
(c)           As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Company

Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting purposes (but not for purposes of benefit accruals except for vacation pay and

maintained for the benefit of Company Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation
for the Company Employees’ service with the Company, its Subsidiaries and their predecessor entities (each, a “Parent Plan”) to the same
extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time under an analogous Company Benefit Plan. With respect to each
Parent Plan that is a “welfare benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent and its Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) cause there to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and
maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees under similar
plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 
(d)          From and after the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing between Parent and a Company Employee

WARN) affecting in whole or in part any site of employment, facility, operating unit or Company Employee.

 
(f)           Nothing in this Agreement shall: (i) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries

to continue to employ any particular Company Employee following the Effective Time for any particular period of time, (ii) be construed to
prohibit Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any Parent Plan (including any

performance criteria, to issue Company Common Stock (whether in the form of restricted stock or fully vested stock) or other equity-based
compensation to employees, consultants and directors, including under the Company’s annual bonus plan and the ERP Implementation Team
Bonus Program; provided, however, the foregoing shall not apply to, or otherwise impair, the rights of any employee under a written Contract
between such employee and the Company in effect on the date hereof and set forth on Section 6.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(unless otherwise agreed in writing by such employee).
 

Section 6.17     2017 Cash Awards and Long Term Retention Awards.
 

(a)           The Company shall, at or prior to the Closing, grant cash awards to each Executive who enters into an employment
agreement with Parent at or prior to the Effective Time, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,170,000, which awards shall vest upon the
Effective Time, subject to each Executive’s continued employment with the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and be
paid in cash as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time. The Company shall obtain acknowledgements by each Executive
receiving such an award that such cash award shall be in full satisfaction of any obligations the Company has to issue Restricted Shares to such
Executive for 2017 under such Executive’s employment agreement with the Company.

(b)           The Surviving Corporation shall, immediately following the Closing, offer to specified employees who are not

Executives or otherwise party to an employment agreement with Parent, a retention award (each, a “Retention Award”) that will provide for a
cash payout (to be specified in a separate agreement) after 36 months of continued employment with the Surviving Corporation following the
Effective Time (the “Retention Period”). Such Retention Awards shall (i) be in the form of cash, (ii) vest upon the completion of the Retention
Period, and (iii) be paid in cash as soon as reasonably practicable following completion of the Retention Period. In no event shall the aggregate
maximum payout of all Retention Awards exceed $900,000. For any such employees covered under the Company’s Legacy Leadership
Severance Policy, the retention agreements for such Retention Awards shall contain an acknowledgment by each recipient that receiving a
Retention Award is consideration in lieu of any 2017 stock compensation to such employee and shall not, in and of itself, give rise to “good
reason” under any applicable agreements, severance policies or arrangements.

 
(c)           Notwithstanding Sections 6.17(a) and 6.17(b), the maximum payout for each award shall in no event exceed $1.00

less than the amount that could give rise to any “parachute payment” within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code after taking into
account all other payments or benefits (including vesting of Restricted Shares) that are payable in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions (in each case, not taking into account any events or payments that could arise following consummation of the Transactions) and
without treating such awards or any other payments or benefits as reasonable compensation (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.280G-1) for purposes of the calculations under Section 280G of the Code.

 
Section 6.18     401(k) Matching Contribution for 2016. Prior to March 15, 2017, the Company shall make the matching

contribution payable by the Company to the Company Profit Sharing Plan for the 2016 plan year. Such matching contribution shall equal an
amount not in excess of $1,522,458 and shall be made in shares of Company Common Stock consistent with past practice, with the shares of
Company Common Stock being valued for such purpose at the average of the high and low trading price for such shares on the date of funding.
The Company shall take such actions as are deemed necessary or advisable to comply with any securities laws or other legal requirements
implicated by the issuance of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Section 6.18.

Section 9.11     Entire Agreement; Benefit.

 
(a)          This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Schedule) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the

entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 
(b)          Neither this Agreement nor any other agreement contemplated hereby is intended to or shall confer upon any person

other than the parties hereto or thereto any legal or equitable rights or remedies or benefits of any nature whatsoever except, following the
Effective Time, for the provisions of Section 6.07. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, (i) prior to the Effective Time, the
Company on behalf of its shareholders shall have the right to pursue Damages (including Damages based on loss of the economic benefits of
the Transactions, including the loss of premium, to the Company’s shareholders) and other relief (including equitable relief) for any breach of
this Agreement by the Parent Entities, which right is hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by the Parent Entities; (ii) following the
Effective Time, the provisions of Article III relating to the payment of the Merger Consideration shall be enforceable by holders of Company
Common Stock and Company Equity Awards; and (iii) the Lender Parties shall be express third party beneficiaries of the Lender Designated
Sections and each of such Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of the Lender Parties and the Lender Parties shall be entitled to rely on
and enforce the provisions of such Sections.

 
(c)          The representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement have been made solely for the benefit of the parties to

this Agreement and (i) are intended not as statements of fact, but rather as a way of allocating the risk to one of the parties if those statements
prove to be inaccurate; and (ii) have been qualified by reference to the Company Disclosure Schedule which contains certain disclosures that
are not reflected in the text of this Agreement.

 
Section 9.12     Extension; Waiver.

 
(a)          At any time prior to the Effective Time, each party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the

obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) to the extent permitted by Law, waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained herein by any other party or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by any other applicable party
or (iii) subject to the proviso to the first sentence of Section 9.02 and to the extent permitted by Law, waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 
(b)          The failure of any party to this Agreement to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not

constitute a waiver by such party of such right.
 
Section 9.13     Disclosure Schedules. All capitalized terms not defined in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall have the

meanings ascribed to them in this Agreement. Any disclosure set forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed to apply to and qualify the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and each other Section or
subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure is relevant to such other Section or
subsection. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible breach or violation of any Contract or Law shall be
construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

(c)          Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be

followed by the words “without limitation”. The word “will” shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect of the word “shall”. The
words “hereof,” “herein” and “hereunder” and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The word “extent” in the phrase “to the extent” shall mean the degree to which a subject
or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply “if”.

made or delivered pursuant thereto unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular

person or Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns.

 
(e)          The phrase “made available,” when used in reference to anything made available to the Parent Entities or their

Representatives shall be deemed to mean that an unredacted copy of such document or other item of information was provided or made
available with printing and downloading access to Parent and its Representatives in the Data Room at least 48 hours prior to the execution of
this Agreement.

 
(f)          Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred

to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of
agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to
all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein.

 
(g)          Each of the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of

intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

(h)          Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be

deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the
part of Parent and the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires Sub to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent and Intermediate Co to cause Sub to take such action.

Annex B

 
February 16, 2017

 
The Board of Directors
LMI Aerospace, Inc.
411 Fountain Lakes Blvd
St. Charles, Missouri 63301
 
Dear Members of the Board:
 

We understand that LMI Aerospace, Inc., a Missouri corporation (the “Company”), Sonaca Group, a limited liability company validly
existing under the laws of Belgium (“Parent”), Sonaca USA Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Intermediate Co”) and a direct, wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, and Luminance Merger Sub, Inc., a Missouri corporation and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and direct
wholly-owned subsidiary of Intermediate Co (“Merger Sub” and, together with Parent and Intermediate Co, the “Parent Entities”), propose to
enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”), pursuant to which Parent will acquire the Company (the “Transaction”).
Pursuant to the Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company and each outstanding share of the common stock, par value
$0.02 per share, of the Company (“Company Common Stock”), other than (i) shares of Company Common stock directly owned by the
Company as treasury stock or directly owned by the Parent Entities and (ii) shares of Company Common Stock held by holders who are entitled
to and properly demand an appraisal of their shares of Company Common Stock (such holders, collectively, “Excluded Holders”), will be
converted into the right to receive $14.00 in cash (the “Consideration”). The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in
the Agreement.

 
You have requested our opinion as of the date hereof as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of Company

Common Stock (other than Excluded Holders) of the Consideration to be paid to such holders in the Transaction.
 
In connection with this opinion, we have:
 
(i) Reviewed the financial terms and conditions of a draft, dated February 16, 2017, of the Agreement;

 
(ii) Reviewed certain publicly available historical business and financial information relating to the Company;

 
(iii) Reviewed various financial forecasts and other data provided to us by the Company relating to the business of the Company,

including the forecasts identified to us as the “Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan”;
 

(iv) Held discussions with members of the senior management of the Company with respect to the business and prospects of the
Company;

 
(v) Reviewed public information with respect to certain other companies in lines of business we believe to be generally relevant

in evaluating the business of the Company;
 

(vi) Reviewed the financial terms of certain business combinations involving companies in lines of business we believe to be
generally relevant in evaluating the business of the Company;

(vii) Reviewed historical stock prices and trading volumes of Company Common Stock; and
 

(viii) Conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as we deemed appropriate.
 

We have assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing information, without independent verification of
such information. We have not conducted any independent valuation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of
the Company or concerning the solvency or fair value of the Company, and we have not been furnished with any such valuation or appraisal.
Management of the Company has advised us that the “Risk-Adjusted January 2017 Plan” reflects the best currently available estimates and
judgments as to the future financial performance of the Company and, accordingly, at the direction of the Board of Directors of the Company,
we have utilized such forecasts for purposes of our financial analyses in connection with this opinion. With respect to the financial forecasts
utilized in our analyses, we have assumed, with the consent of the Company, that they have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the
best currently available estimates and judgments as to the future financial performance of the Company. We assume no responsibility for and
express no view as to any such forecasts or the assumptions on which they are based.

 
Further, our opinion is necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information

made available to us as of, the date hereof. We assume no responsibility for updating or revising our opinion based on circumstances or events
occurring after the date hereof. We do not express any opinion as to the price at which shares of Company Common Stock may trade at any
time subsequent to the announcement of the Transaction. In connection with our engagement, we were not authorized to, and we did not, solicit
indications of interest from third parties regarding a potential transaction with the Company. In addition, our opinion does not address the
relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any other transaction or business strategy in which the Company might engage or the merits
of the underlying decision by the Company to engage in the Transaction.

 
In rendering our opinion, we have assumed, with the consent of the Company, that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms

described in the Agreement, without any waiver or modification of any material terms or conditions. Representatives of the Company have
advised us, and we have assumed, that the Agreement, when executed, will conform to the draft reviewed by us in all material respects. We also
have assumed, with the consent of the Company, that obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory or third party approvals and consents
for the Transaction will not have an adverse effect on the Company or the Transaction. We do not express any opinion as to any tax or other
consequences that might result from the Transaction, nor does our opinion address any legal, tax, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which
we understand that the Company obtained such advice as it deemed necessary from qualified professionals. We express no view or opinion as
to any terms or other aspects (other than the Consideration to the extent expressly specified herein) of the Transaction, including, without
limitation, the form or structure of the Transaction or any agreements or arrangements entered into in connection with, or contemplated by, the
Transaction. In addition, we express no view or opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the
compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the Transaction, or class of such persons, relative to the Consideration or
otherwise.

Lazard Frères & Co. LLC (“Lazard”) is acting as financial advisor to the Company in connection with the Transaction and will receive
a fee for such services, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion, and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon
the closing of the Transaction. We in the past two years have provided certain investment banking services to Société Régionale
d’Investissement de Wallonie, an affiliate of Parent, for which we have received compensation. In addition, in the ordinary course, Lazard and
its affiliates and employees may trade securities of the Company and certain affiliaties of the Company and Parent for their own accounts and
for the accounts of their customers, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities, and may also trade and hold securities on
behalf of the Company, Parent and certain of their respective affiliates. The issuance of this opinion was approved by the Opinion Committee of
Lazard.

Annex C

 
SECTION 351.455 OF THE GENERAL AND BUSINESS CORPORATION LAW OF MISSOURI

 
§ 351.455. Shareholder entitled to appraisal and payment of fair value, when – remedy exclusive, when
 

1. Any shareholder shall be deemed a dissenting shareholder and entitled to appraisal under this section if such shareholder:
 

(1) Owns stock of a corporation which is a party to a merger or consolidation as of the record date for the meeting of shareholders at
which the plan of merger or consolidation is submitted to a vote;

 
(2) Files with the corporation before or at such meeting a written objection to such plan of merger or consolidation;
 
(3) Does not vote in favor thereof if the shareholder owns voting stock as of such record date; and
 
(4) Makes written demand on the surviving or new corporation within twenty days after the merger or consolidation is effected for

payment of the fair value of such shareholder’s shares as of the day before the date on which the vote was taken approving the merger or
consolidation.

 
2. The surviving or new corporation shall pay to each such dissenting shareholder, upon surrender of his or her certificate or certificates

representing said shares in the case of certificated shares, the fair value thereof. Such demand shall state the number and class of the shares
owned by such dissenting shareholder. Any shareholder who:

 
(1) Fails to file a written objection prior to or at such meeting;
 
(2) Fails to make demand within the twenty-day period; or
 
(3) In the case of a shareholder owning voting stock as of such record date, votes in favor of the merger or consolidation;
 

shall be conclusively presumed to have consented to the merger or consolidation and shall be bound by the terms thereof and shall not be
deemed to be a dissenting shareholder.
 

3. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 1 of section 351.230, notice under the provisions of subsection 1 of section 351.230
stating the purpose for which the meeting is called shall be given to each shareholder owning stock as of the record date for the meeting of
shareholders at which the plan of merger or consolidation is submitted to a vote, whether or not such shareholder is entitled to vote.

4. If within thirty days after the date on which such merger or consolidation was effected the value of such shares is agreed upon between

the dissenting shareholder and the surviving or new corporation, payment therefor shall be made within ninety days after the date on which
such merger or consolidation was effected, upon the surrender of his or her certificate or certificates representing said shares in the case of
certificated shares. Upon payment of the agreed value the dissenting shareholder shall cease to have any interest in such shares or in the
corporation.

 
5. If within such period of thirty days the shareholder and the surviving or new corporation do not so agree, then the dissenting

shareholder may, within sixty days after the expiration of the thirty-day period, file a petition in any court of competent jurisdiction within the
county in which the registered office of the surviving or new corporation is situated, asking for a finding and determination of the fair value of
such shares, and shall be entitled to judgment against the surviving or new corporation for the amount of such fair value as of the day prior to
the date on which such vote was taken approving such merger or consolidation, together with interest thereon to the date of such judgment. The
judgment shall be payable only upon and simultaneously with the surrender to the surviving or new corporation of the certificate or certificates
representing said shares in the case of certificated shares. Upon the payment of the judgment, the dissenting shareholder shall cease to have any
interest in such shares, or in the surviving or new corporation. Such shares may be held and disposed of by the surviving or new corporation as
it may see fit. Unless the dissenting shareholder shall file such petition within the time herein limited, such shareholder and all persons claiming
under such shareholder shall be conclusively presumed to have approved and ratified the merger or consolidation, and shall be bound by the
terms thereof.

 
6. The right of a dissenting shareholder to be paid the fair value of such shareholder’s shares as herein provided shall cease if and when

the corporation shall abandon the merger or consolidation.
 
7. When the remedy provided for in this section is available with respect to a transaction, such remedy shall be the exclusive remedy of

the shareholder as to that transaction, except in the case of fraud or lack of authorization for the transaction.
