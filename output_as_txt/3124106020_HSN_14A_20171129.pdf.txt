TRANSACTION PROPOSALS—YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT

Dear Stockholders of HSN, Inc.:

           HSN, Inc., a Delaware corporation (HSNi), Liberty Interactive Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Liberty Interactive), and Liberty Horizon, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty
Interactive (Merger Sub), have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 5, 2017 (as may be amended from time to time, the merger agreement), pursuant to which Liberty Interactive has agreed to acquire
HSNi by way of a merger of Merger Sub with and into HSNi (the merger), with HSNi surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive. Liberty Interactive indirectly currently owns approximately 38.2% of the
outstanding shares of HSNi's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the HSNi common stock), and if the merger is completed, will acquire the remaining 61.8% of shares of HSNi common stock.

           If the merger is completed, and upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, holders of shares of HSNi common stock (HSNi stockholders) (other than Liberty Interactive and its wholly owned
subsidiaries) will receive 1.650 shares of Liberty Interactive's Series A QVC Group common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Liberty QVCA common stock), in exchange for each share of HSNi common stock held by such
holder immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. The market value of the Liberty QVCA common stock to be issued in the merger will fluctuate with the trading price of Liberty QVCA common stock. The exchange
ratio equates to total consideration of $40.36 per share of HSNi common stock, based on the closing price of Liberty QVCA common stock on July 5, 2017, the last trading day before the public announcement of the execution of
the merger agreement, and to $40.95 per share of HSNi common stock, based on the closing price of Liberty QVCA common stock on November 24, 2017, the last practicable date before the filing of the proxy statement/prospectus
accompanying this notice. Liberty Interactive intends to issue approximately 53.5 million shares of Liberty QVCA common stock to HSNi stockholders, and HSNi stockholders are expected to own approximately 11.1% of the
undiluted equity and 7.2% of the undiluted voting power of Liberty Interactive's QVC Group tracking stock group, in each case based on the number of shares outstanding as of October 31, 2017. Additionally, HSNi stockholders
are expected to own approximately 6.2% of the undiluted voting power of Liberty Interactive as a whole, taking into account the outstanding shares of Liberty Interactive's Ventures Group tracking stock as of the same date.

           HSNi stockholders should obtain current stock price quotations for shares of HSNi common stock and shares of Liberty QVCA common stock. Shares of HSNi common stock and Liberty QVCA common stock are listed on
the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbols "HSNi" and "QVCA," respectively. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, it is a condition to the completion of the merger that the shares of Liberty QVCA common
stock issuable in the merger be authorized for listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, subject to official notice of issuance.

           HSNi will be holding a special meeting of HSNi stockholders for the purpose of voting on certain matters in connection with the merger (the HSNi special meeting). No vote of stockholders of Liberty Interactive is required
in connection with the merger, nor is any such vote being sought.

           HSNi stockholders as of the close of business on October 31, 2017, the record date of the HSNi special meeting, are cordially invited to attend a special meeting of HSNi stockholders to be held on December 29, 2017, at
HSNi's corporate headquarters, located at 1 HSN Drive, St. Petersburg, Florida 33729, at 10:00 a.m., local time. HSNi is holding the HSNi special meeting in order to obtain the stockholder approval necessary to approve the merger
agreement (the merger agreement proposal), as well as certain other matters. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement and applicable law, the approval of the merger agreement proposal is a condition to the completion of the
merger.

           The HSNi board of directors, acting on the recommendation of a special committee thereof, has determined that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are fair to, and in the best interests
of, HSNi and its stockholders, and has approved and declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, and recommends that HSNi stockholders vote "FOR" the merger
agreement proposal and "FOR" each of the other proposals described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus. Liberty Interactive has agreed to vote all of the shares of HSNi common stock beneficially owned by it
(constituting approximately 38.2% of the issued and outstanding shares of HSNi common stock as of November 24, 2017) in favor of the merger agreement proposal and in favor of any other matter necessary to consummate the
merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement.

           Your vote is important, regardless of the number of shares you own. Whether or not you plan to attend the HSNi special meeting, please vote as soon as possible to make sure that your shares are represented.
Submitting a proxy now will not prevent you from being able to vote in person at the HSNi special meeting.

           Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the merger, the adoption of the merger agreement, the issuance of the shares of Liberty
QVCA common stock in the merger, or any of the other transactions described in the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus or determined if this proxy statement/prospectus is truthful or complete. Any
representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

           The obligations of HSNi and Liberty Interactive to complete the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the merger
agreement, a copy of which is included as part of the accompanying proxy statement/prospectus. The proxy statement/prospectus provides you with detailed
information about the proposed merger. It also contains or references information about HSNi and Liberty Interactive and certain related matters. You are encouraged
to read the proxy statement/prospectus carefully and in its entirety. In particular, you should carefully read the section entitled "Risk Factors" beginning on page 21 of
the proxy statement/prospectus for a discussion of risks you should consider in evaluating the proposed merger and the issuance of shares of Liberty QVCA common
stock in connection with the merger and how they will affect you.

           Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to the successful completion of the merger.

           The accompanying proxy statement/prospectus is dated November 28, 2017 and is first being mailed to the HSNi stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 31, 2017.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 

        The questions and answers below highlight only selected information about the merger, the merger agreement and the HSNi special meeting, and how to vote your
shares of HSNi common stock. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as an HSNi stockholder. You should carefully read
the entire proxy statement/prospectus, including the Annexes and the additional documents incorporated by reference herein, to fully understand the proposals being
considered at the HSNi special meeting.

Q: Why am I receiving this document? 

A: This document is being delivered to you because HSN, Inc., a Delaware corporation (HSNi), is holding a special meeting (the HSNi special meeting) of holders of
shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the HSNi common stock), in connection with a proposed merger to be effected pursuant to the Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 5, 2017, by and among Liberty Interactive Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Liberty Interactive), Liberty Horizon, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive (Merger Sub), and HSNi (as may be amended from time to time, the merger
agreement). 

Pursuant to the merger agreement, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Liberty Interactive has agreed to acquire HSNi by means of a merger
(the merger) of Merger Sub with and into HSNi, with HSNi surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive (the surviving corporation).
The merger agreement must be adopted by the holders of shares of HSNi common stock (the HSNi stockholders) in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the DGCL) in order for the merger to be consummated. At the HSNi special meeting, the HSNi stockholders will consider and vote on a
proposal to adopt the merger agreement, along with certain other matters described in this proxy statement/prospectus.

If the merger is completed, the surviving corporation will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive, and HSNi will no longer be a publicly traded
company.

Q: What will HSNi stockholders receive in the merger? 

A: In the merger, each HSNi stockholder (other than Liberty Interactive or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries) will receive 1.650 shares (the exchange ratio) of
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Liberty Interactive's Series A QVC Group common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Liberty QVCA
common stock, and the shares of Liberty QVCA common stock to be received by each HSNi stockholder in the merger, the merger consideration), for each share
of HSNi common stock held by such holder. The exchange ratio is fixed and will not reflect changes in the price of HSNi common stock or Liberty QVCA
common stock prior to the closing of the merger. Based on the closing price of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market
(Nasdaq) on July 5, 2017, the last trading day before public announcement of the merger agreement, the exchange ratio represented approximately $40.36 in
shares of Liberty QVCA common stock for each share of HSNi common stock, and, based on the closing price of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock on
November 24, 2017, the last practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement/prospectus, the exchange ratio represented approximately $40.95 in shares of
Liberty QVCA common stock. The exchange ratio is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, such as in the event of a stock split or of a stock dividend on
shares of Liberty QVCA common stock. 

Each share of HSNi common stock held by Liberty Interactive or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the surviving corporation.

Each share of HSNi common stock held by HSNi as treasury stock will be cancelled and will cease to exist.

Liberty Interactive intends to issue approximately 53.5 million shares of Liberty QVCA common stock to HSNi stockholders, and HSNi stockholders are expected
to own approximately 11.1% of the undiluted equity and 7.2% of the undiluted voting power of Liberty Interactive's QVC Group tracking stock group (the QVC
Group), in each case, based on the number of shares outstanding as of October 31, 2017. Additionally, HSNi stockholders are expected to own approximately
6.2% of the undiluted voting power of Liberty Interactive as a whole, taking into account the outstanding shares of Liberty Interactive's Ventures Group tracking
stock outstanding as of the same date. The exact equity and voting stake of HSNi stockholders in Liberty Interactive immediately following the merger will depend
on the number of shares of HSNi common stock and common stock of Liberty Interactive outstanding at that time. See "Summary—The Companies—Liberty
Interactive Corporation" for a discussion of Liberty Interactive's tracking stock structure.

Q: What will the relationship be between HSNi and Liberty Interactive after the completion of the merger? 

A: If the merger is completed, the surviving corporation will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive. As a result of the merger, HSNi will no longer
be a publicly held company. Following the merger, shares of HSNi common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). 

Q: What will happen to stock-based awards with respect to shares of HSNi common stock granted by HSNi to employees and non-employee directors? 

A: Stock Options.    At the effective time of the merger (the effective time), each option to purchase shares of HSNi common stock (an HSNi stock option) that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of Liberty
QVCA common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of HSNi common stock subject to such HSNi stock option immediately prior to the effective
time and (ii) the exchange ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, at an exercise price per share determined by dividing the per-share exercise price of the
HSNi stock option immediately prior to the effective time by the exchange ratio (rounding the resulting quotient up to the nearest whole cent). Following such
adjustment, any restrictions applicable to the exercise of an HSNi stock option will continue in full force and effect and the terms, exercisability, vesting schedules
and other provisions will remain unchanged. 

Stock Appreciation Rights.    At the effective time, each stock appreciation right with respect to shares of HSNi common stock (an HSNi SAR) that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, will be converted into a stock appreciation right with respect to a number of shares of
Liberty QVCA common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of HSNi common stock subject to such HSNi SAR immediately prior to the effective
time and (ii) the exchange ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, at an exercise price per share determined by dividing the exercise price of such HSNi
SAR immediately prior to the effective time by the exchange ratio (rounding the resulting quotient up to the nearest whole cent). Following such adjustment, any
restrictions applicable to the exercise of an HSNi SAR will continue in full force and effect and the terms, exercisability, vesting schedules and other provisions
will remain unchanged.

Restricted Stock Units.    At the effective time, each award of restricted stock units with respect to shares of HSNi common stock (an HSNi RSU) that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the

Table of Contents

effective time, that is subject to time-based vesting, will be converted into an award of restricted stock units with respect to a number of shares of Liberty QVCA
common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of HSNi common stock subject to such HSNi RSU immediately prior to the effective time and
(ii) the exchange ratio, rounded to the nearest whole share. Following such adjustment, any vesting conditions and restrictions on the receipt of an HSNi RSU will
continue in full force and effect and the terms, vesting schedules and other provisions will remain unchanged.

Performance Share Units.    At the effective time, each award of performance share units with respect to shares of HSNi common stock (an HSNi PSU) that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted into an award of performance share units with respect to a target number
of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock equal to the product of (i) the target number of shares of HSNi common stock subject to such HSNi PSU immediately
prior to the effective time and (ii) the exchange ratio, rounded to the nearest whole share. Following such adjustment, any vesting conditions and restrictions on the
receipt of an HSNi PSU will continue in full force and effect and the terms, vesting schedules and other provisions will remain unchanged.

Q: Will the rights associated with my shares of HSNi common stock change as a result of the merger? 

A: Yes. Liberty QVCA common stock is a tracking stock of Liberty Interactive. Accordingly, Liberty QVCA common stock includes terms that are specific to a
tracking stock and would not typically apply to a regular common stock, such as conversion at the option of the issuer, redemption for stock of a subsidiary,
mandatory conversion, inter-group interests, and certain redemption or dividend requirements upon an asset disposition. None of these tracking stock-specific
terms apply to HSNi common stock. In addition, HSNi stockholders will have different rights once they become holders of Liberty QVCA common stock due to
the differences between the governing documents of HSNi and Liberty Interactive, including: 

• voting rights; 

• proposals at annual and special meetings of stockholders; and 

• amendments to governing documents. 

For additional information regarding the Liberty QVCA common stock, see "Comparison of Stockholders' Rights."

Q: What happens if the market price of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock or HSNi common stock changes prior to the closing of the merger? 

A: No change will be made to the exchange ratio if the market price of Liberty QVCA common stock or HSNi common stock changes prior to the closing of the
merger. Because the exchange ratio is fixed, the value of the shares of Liberty QVCA common stock to be received by HSNi stockholders in the merger will
depend solely on the market price of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock at the effective time. 

Q: Will Liberty Interactive issue fractional shares of Liberty QVCA common stock in the merger? 

A: Liberty Interactive will not issue fractional shares of Liberty QVCA common stock in the merger. To the extent that the merger would result in an HSNi
stockholder being issued a fractional share, such HSNi stockholder will instead receive a cash payment in an amount based on the aggregation and sale of all
fractional shares by Liberty Interactive's exchange agent for the merger at prevailing market prices on behalf of such HSNi stockholder. Amounts payable in lieu of
such fractional

Table of Contents

shares will be payable from the proceeds of the aggregation and sale of the fractional shares as soon as practicable following the completion of the merger. No
HSNi stockholder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights with respect to any fractional shares.

Q: What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to HSNi stockholders? 

A: It is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), which we refer to as the Intended Tax Treatment. However, the completion of the merger is not conditioned on the merger
qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment or upon the receipt of an opinion of counsel to that effect. In addition, neither Liberty Interactive nor HSNi intends to
request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be
given that the merger will qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment. Further, even if Liberty Interactive and HSNi conclude that the merger qualifies for the Intended
Tax Treatment, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge that conclusion or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. 

Assuming the merger qualifies for the Intended Tax Treatment, U.S. Holders (as defined in the section entitled "Special Factors—Material U.S. Federal Income
Tax Consequences" below) of HSNi common stock will not recognize any gain or loss upon the receipt of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock in the merger,
except with respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Liberty QVCA common stock.

If, at the effective time of the merger, any requirement for the merger to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment is not satisfied, a U.S. Holder of HSNi common
stock would generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the fair market value of the shares of Liberty QVCA
common stock received in the merger and the amount of any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Liberty QVCA common stock pursuant to the merger and
(ii) such holder's basis in the shares of HSNi common stock surrendered.

Each HSNi stockholder should read the discussion under "Special Factors—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" and should consult its own tax
advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the merger to such stockholder.

Q: Is the completion of the merger subject to any conditions? 

A: Yes. The completion of the merger depends on the satisfaction or, if applicable, waiver, of a number of conditions, including: 

• the receipt of the requisite approval of the HSNi stockholders of the merger agreement proposal; 

• the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the HSR Act), and the
receipt of approval of the Federal Communications Commission (the FCC) of certain applications for transfer of control and/or assignment of certain FCC
licenses, authorizations and registrations (the FCC Approvals); 

• the absence of any judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree that prohibits, renders illegal or permanently enjoins the consummation of the merger; 

• the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, and there being no stop order or
proceedings relating thereto; and 

• the approval of Nasdaq for the listing of the shares of Liberty QVCA common stock to be issued in the merger.

Table of Contents

For more information, please see "Special Factors—The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Completion of the Merger."

Q: What regulatory approvals are required to complete the merger? 

A: The completion of the merger is conditioned on, among other things, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. In addition,
Liberty Interactive's obligation to effect the merger is conditioned upon the receipt of the FCC Approvals. 

Under the terms of the merger agreement, each of Liberty Interactive and HSNi agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary
regulatory approvals, provided that neither party is required to agree to any requirement to sell or otherwise dispose of any asset or business that would materially
adversely affect such party (but, in the case of Liberty Interactive, with respect to the QVC Group only), or would prohibit or materially limit the ownership,
control or operation by such party of its respective businesses or assets (but, in the case of Liberty Interactive, with respect to the QVC Group only).

For more information, please see "Special Factors—Regulatory Approvals."

Q: Is the merger structured so that approval of at least a majority of unaffiliated HSNi stockholders is required? 

A: No. The merger is not structured so that the approval of at least a majority of the unaffiliated HSNi stockholders is required. 

Q: Can HSNi solicit alternative transactions? 

A: No. HSNi is subject to a "no-shop" restriction that limits its ability to solicit alternative transaction proposals from, or engage in discussions with, third parties,
except under limited circumstances to permit the board of directors of HSNi (the HSNi board) to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. 

Under the terms of the merger agreement, HSNi may not, and agreed to cause each of its representatives and subsidiaries not to, solicit certain alternative
transaction proposals (as further discussed herein) or engage in activities, discussions or negotiations with third parties with respect to certain alternative
transaction proposals, unless the HSNi board receives a bona fide written proposal that (i) did not result from a breach of HSNi's non-solicitation obligations and
(ii) in the good faith determination of the HSNi board, is or is reasonably expected to result in a superior transaction proposal (as further discussed herein). In the
case of such a superior transaction proposal or an intervening event (as further discussed herein), the HSNi board may change its recommendation with respect to
the merger, or, solely in the case of a superior transaction proposal, HSNi may terminate the merger agreement and enter into a definitive transaction agreement
with respect to such superior transaction proposal, if, in either case, the HSNi board believes that the failure to take such action with respect to the merger would be
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

If the HSNi board intends to change its recommendation with respect to the merger as a result of a superior transaction proposal or intervening event, or to
terminate the merger agreement in order to enter concurrently into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior transaction proposal, it must first negotiate in
good faith with Liberty Interactive for at least four business days to modify the merger agreement such that the failure to change its recommendation or terminate
the merger agreement, as applicable, would no longer be likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

For more information, see "Special Factors—The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation."

Table of Contents

Q: Can the merger agreement be terminated by the parties? 

A: Yes. The merger agreement may be terminated prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before or after the receipt of the required approval of the HSNi
stockholders: 

• by mutual written consent of each of Liberty Interactive, Merger Sub and HSNi; 

• by either Liberty Interactive or HSNi, if the merger is not consummated on or before April 5, 2018 (the outside date), provided that either party may
extend the outside date for a period of six months upon written notice to the other party if all conditions to the closing of the merger have been satisfied or
waived, or are capable of being satisfied, other than conditions relating to antitrust approval or the receipt of the FCC Approvals; 

• by either Liberty Interactive or HSNi, if there is a final, non-appealable judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree by any governmental authority
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger; or 

• by either Liberty Interactive or HSNi, if the required approval of the HSNi stockholders is not obtained at a meeting of the HSNi stockholders at which a
final vote was taken, provided that the party seeking to terminate the merger agreement following the failure to obtain such stockholder approval is not in
material breach of its obligations under the merger agreement. 

The merger agreement may also be terminated by HSNi:

• prior to the receipt of the required approval of the HSNi stockholders, in order for HSNi to enter concurrently into a definitive written agreement with
respect to a superior transaction proposal; or 

• provided that HSNi is not in material breach of any of its obligations under the merger agreement, there is any continuing breach in the representations and
warranties of Liberty Interactive or Merger Sub, or Liberty Interactive is failing to perform any of its covenants or other agreements under the merger
agreement that would cause certain conditions to the completion of the merger to not be satisfied, subject to a cure period. 

The merger agreement may also be terminated by Liberty Interactive:

• prior to the receipt of the required approval of the HSNi stockholders, if the HSNi board changes its recommendation with respect to the merger, or HSNi
materially breaches or fails to perform its non-solicitation obligations and such breach or failure to perform leads to or results in an alternative transaction
proposal; or 

• provided that neither Liberty Interactive nor Merger Sub is in material breach of any of its obligations under the merger agreement, there is any continuing
breach in the representations and warranties of HSNi, or HSNi is materially failing to perform any of its covenants or other agreements under the merger
agreement that would cause certain conditions to the completion of the merger to not be satisfied, subject to a cure period. 

Q: Are there any fees payable by the parties in connection with a termination of the merger agreement? 

A: Yes, in certain circumstances. Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, HSNi will pay Liberty Interactive a one-time termination fee of
$40 million if (i) HSNi terminates the merger agreement to enter concurrently into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior transaction proposal,
(ii) Liberty Interactive terminates the merger agreement as a result of (x) the HSNi board changing its recommendation with respect to the merger or (y) HSNi
materially breaching or failing to perform its non-solicitation obligations, and such breach or failure to perform leads to or results in an alternative transaction
proposal, or (iii) (A) an alternative

transaction proposal is made to HSNi, (B) the merger agreement is terminated (1) by HSNi or Liberty Interactive due to the failure to consummate the merger by
the outside date, (2) by HSNi or Liberty Interactive due to the failure of the HSNi stockholders to approve the merger or (3) by Liberty Interactive due to HSNi's
breach of its covenants in a way that prevents satisfaction of certain closing conditions, subject to a cure period, and (C) within fifteen (15) months of such
termination, HSNi enters into an agreement for an alternative transaction that meets certain requirements (as further discussed herein) and such alternative
transaction is later consummated.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, Liberty Interactive will pay HSNi a one-time termination fee of $75 million (i) if the merger has not
been consummated on or before the outside date (as it may be extended) as a result of the required regulatory approvals having not been obtained or (ii) if any court
or other governmental authority has issued an order or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger under any
competition law or the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), and such order or other action is, or has become, final and non-
appealable, and, in each case, all other mutual conditions and the conditions of Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub to the completion to the merger are satisfied or
capable of being satisfied.

For more information, see "Special Factors—The Merger Agreement—Termination Fees."

Q: When do you expect the merger to be completed? 

A: Liberty Interactive and HSNi currently expect to complete the merger during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2017. However, the merger is subject to various
conditions, including applicable regulatory and stockholder approvals, and it is possible that factors outside of the control of Liberty Interactive and HSNi could
result in the merger being completed at a later time, or not at all. There may be a substantial amount of time between the HSNi special meeting and the completion
of the merger. 

For more information, see "Special Factors—The Merger Agreement—Conditions to the Completion of the Merger."

Q: What happens to the HSNi stockholder rights plan as a result of the merger agreement and the merger? 

A: In connection with the merger, on July 5, 2017, HSNi entered into an amendment (the rights plan amendment) to the Rights Agreement, dated as of
December 23, 2008 (the HSNi rights plan), by and between HSNi and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as successor-in-interest to The Bank of New York
Mellon, a New York banking corporation. Among other things, the rights plan amendment (i) exempts the approval, execution, delivery and performance of the
merger agreement and the other contracts or instruments related thereto, and the announcement and the consummation of the merger, such that the rights issued
under the HSNi rights plan to acquire shares of HSNi common stock (the HSNi rights) will not become exercisable, and (ii) provides for the expiration of the
HSNi rights in their entirety, and the termination of the HSNi rights plan immediately prior to the effective time (but only if the effective time occurs) without any
consideration payable therefor or in respect thereof. 

Q: What will happen to Liberty Interactive and the QVC Group following Liberty Interactive's previously announced transaction with General
Communication, Inc.? 

A: On April 4, 2017, Liberty Interactive, Liberty Interactive LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive
(Liberty LLC), and General Communication, Inc., an Alaska corporation (GCI), entered into an agreement (as amended, the GCI reorganization agreement)
whereby Liberty Interactive agreed, on the terms and subject to

Table of Contents

the conditions set forth therein, to acquire GCI through a reorganization in which certain assets and liabilities currently attributed to Liberty Interactive's Ventures
Group tracking stock group (the Ventures Group) will be contributed to GCI in exchange for a controlling interest in GCI. Liberty Interactive would then effect a
tax-free split-off of its controlling interest in the combined company (to be named GCI Liberty, Inc. (GCI Liberty)) to the holders of shares of Liberty Interactive's
Series A Liberty Ventures common stock, par value $0.01 per share (LVNTA), and Series B Liberty Ventures common stock, par value $0.01 per share (LVNTB,
and together with LVNTA, the Liberty Ventures common stock), in full redemption of all outstanding shares of Liberty Ventures common stock. The transactions
contemplated by the GCI reorganization agreement (the GCI transactions) currently are expected to be consummated during the first quarter of 2018, subject to
the satisfaction or waiver, if applicable or permitted, of all closing conditions set forth in the GCI reorganization agreement. The completion of the merger is not a
condition to the completion of the GCI transactions, nor is the completion of the GCI transactions a condition to the completion of the merger.

Following the completion of the GCI transactions, Liberty Interactive will be renamed "QVC Group, Inc." and the QVC Group common stock (as defined below)
will become an asset-backed security. In addition, Liberty Interactive expects to submit to its stockholders at its first annual meeting following the closing of the
GCI transactions an amendment to the restated certificate of incorporation of Liberty Interactive, as amended (as currently in effect, the Liberty Interactive
charter), which would eliminate all of the tracking stock-specific terms and provisions of the QVC Group common stock. The amended Liberty Interactive charter
would retain Liberty Interactive's current voting structure, pursuant to which each share of Liberty QVCA common stock is entitled to one vote per share, and each
share of Liberty Interactive's Series B QVC Group common stock, par value $0.01 per share (QVCB, and together with the Liberty QVCA common stock, the
QVC Group common stock), is entitled to ten votes per share on all matters submitted to the holders of QVC Group common stock.

Liberty Interactive does not expect to submit the amendment to the Liberty Interactive charter to its stockholders in the event the merger is not completed prior to
the first annual meeting of its stockholders following the closing of the GCI transactions.

Following the completion of the GCI transactions and the merger, it is expected that Mr. John C. Malone, chairman of the board of directors of Liberty Interactive,
will own an approximate 5.8% equity interest and an approximate 37.1% voting interest in QVC Group, Inc., based on the number of outstanding shares of QVC
Group common stock on October 31, 2017 and the number of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock expected to be issued to HSNi stockholders.

For additional information regarding those provisions which are specific to Liberty Interactive's tracking stock structure, see "Comparison of Stockholders' Rights."

Q: What is the accounting treatment for the merger? 

A: In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), the merger will be accounted for by Liberty Interactive under the
acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. 

Q: What is the dividend policy of HSNi pending completion of the merger? 

A: Under the terms of the merger agreement, HSNi is permitted to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends to HSNi stockholders in an amount not to exceed
$0.35 per share of HSNi common stock per fiscal quarter, provided that such dividends will not be paid using funds borrowed specifically for that purpose. Other
than such regular quarterly cash dividends, HSNi has agreed

not to (i) declare, set aside, make or pay any other dividend or make any other distribution (whether payable in cash, stock, property or a combination thereof) with
respect to any of its capital stock, (ii) reclassify, combine, split or subdivide any of its capital stock or (iii) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any equity
interest in HSNi or any of its subsidiaries.

Q: When and where will the HSNi special meeting be held? 

A: The HSNi special meeting will be held at HSNi's corporate headquarters, located at 1 HSN Drive, St. Petersburg, Florida, 33729, on December 29, 2017, at
10:00 a.m., local time. 

Q: Who is entitled to vote at the HSNi special meeting and how many votes do I have? 

A: The HSNi board has fixed October 31, 2017 as the record date for the HSNi special meeting (the HSNi record date). All holders of record of shares of HSNi
common stock as of the close of business on the HSNi record date are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the HSNi special meeting. Please see "The HSNi
Special Meeting—Voting Procedures for Record Holders" for instructions on how to vote your shares of HSNi common stock at the HSNi special meeting. 

Each HSNi stockholder of record is entitled to one vote for each share of HSNi common stock held of record by him or her as of the close of business on the HSNi
record date. As of the close of business on the HSNi record date, there were 52,434,369 shares of HSNi common stock issued and outstanding.

Q: What am I being asked to vote on? 

A: At the HSNi special meeting, HSNi stockholders are being asked to consider and vote upon: 

• a proposal to approve the adoption of the merger agreement (the merger agreement proposal); 

• a proposal to authorize the adjournment of the HSNi special meeting by HSNi to permit further solicitation of proxies, if necessary or appropriate, if
sufficient votes are not represented at the HSNi special meeting to approve the merger agreement proposal (the adjournment proposal); and 

• a proposal to approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, certain compensation that may be paid or become payable to HSNi's named executive officers that is
based on or otherwise relates to the merger (the non-binding compensation advisory proposal). 

The approval of the merger agreement proposal is a condition to the completion of the merger. The approval of the adjournment proposal and the non-
binding compensation advisory proposal are not conditions to the completion of the merger.

Q: Why am I being asked to consider and vote on a proposal, by non-binding advisory vote, concerning compensation that may become payable to HSNi's
named executive officers in connection with the merger? 

A: The Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) has adopted rules that require HSNi to seek a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation payments that
will or may be made to its named executive officers, that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger and that will or may become payable to its named executive
officers at the closing of the merger or on a qualifying termination of employment upon or following the consummation of the merger. This compensation is
referred to as "golden parachute" compensation by the applicable SEC disclosure rules. HSNi urges its stockholders to read the section entitled "Special Factors—
Interests of Certain Persons of HSNi in the Merger."

Table of Contents

Q. What vote is required to approve each proposal? 

A: The merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the shares of HSNi common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote on such proposal, voting together as a single class. Each of the adjournment proposal and the non-binding compensation advisory
proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on such proposal (assuming a quorum is present). 

Q: How does the board of directors of HSNi recommend that I vote? 

A: The HSNi board recommends that you vote "FOR" the merger agreement proposal, "FOR" the adjournment proposal if necessary to solicit additional proxies in
favor of the approval of the merger agreement proposal and "FOR" the non-binding compensation advisory proposal. Please see "Additional Information—Where
You Can Find More Information." Your vote is important. Adoption of the merger agreement by the HSNi stockholders is a condition to the completion of
the merger and requires the affirmative vote, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of HSNi common stock
outstanding and entitled to vote on such proposal, voting together as a single class. Adoption of the other proposals to be considered at the special meeting
requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively on such proposals. 

For more information regarding how the HSNi board recommends you vote, please see "Special Factors—HSNi's Purpose and Reasons for the Merger and Other
Proposals; Recommendations of the Special Committee and HSNi Board; Fairness of the Merger."

Q: Did the HSNi board form a special committee, and did the special committee receive opinions from its financial advisors? 

The HSNi board formed a special committee to review and evaluate potential strategic transactions with Liberty Interactive and other potential third parties (the
Special Committee). The Special Committee was authorized by the HSNi board to (i) review, evaluate and negotiate the terms and conditions of a potential
strategic transaction involving Liberty Interactive and, if the Special Committee deemed it appropriate, alternative transactions, including the possibility of a sale,
merger or recapitalization of all or any portion of HSNi, (ii) negotiate with Liberty Interactive any element of any such potential transaction, (iii) negotiate with any
other third party or parties the terms of any such alternative transaction, (iv) negotiate the terms of any definitive agreement with respect to any such transaction,
the execution of which would be subject to the approval of the HSNi board, (v) determine and recommend to the HSNi board whether any such potential
transaction was advisable and fair to and in the best interests of, HSNi and the HSNi stockholders and (vi) determine to elect not to pursue any such potential
transaction. The HSNi board resolved not to approve any such transaction unless it was recommended by the Special Committee. Please see "Special Factors—
Background of the Merger" and "Special Factors—HSNi's Purpose and Reasons for the Merger and Other Proposals; Recommendations of the Special Committee
and HSNi Board; Fairness of the Merger."

The Special Committee engaged both Centerview Partners LLC (Centerview Partners) and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (Goldman Sachs) as financial advisors to
the Special Committee.

In connection with this engagement, the Special Committee requested that Centerview Partners evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders
of shares of HSNi common stock (other than shares held by HSNi as treasury stock and shares held by Liberty Interactive, its affiliates and other specified persons
and entities related to a significant stockholder of Liberty Interactive, which are collectively referred to as Excluded Shares throughout this section and the

Q: Have a majority of directors who are not employees of HSNi retained an unaffiliated representative to act solely on behalf of unaffiliated HSNi
stockholders for purposes of negotiating the terms of the merger and/or preparing a report concerning the fairness of the merger? 

A: None of the directors of HSNi are employees of HSNi. As described more fully in the section entitled "Special Factors—Background of the Merger," the Special
Committee, which consists entirely of independent and disinterested directors, was formed for the purpose of reviewing, evaluating and negotiating potential
strategic transactions with Liberty Interactive and other potential third parties and, ultimately, recommending in favor or against any such transaction. The Special
Committee retained Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs as its financial advisors. On July 5, 2017, Centerview Partners rendered its oral opinion to the Special
Committee (with the other Qualified Directors present), which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated such date, as of such date and
based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by
Centerview Partners in preparing its opinion, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be received by the HSNi stockholders
(other than as specified in such opinion) pursuant to the merger agreement. Also on July 5, 2017, Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion to the Special
Committee (with the other Qualified Directors present), which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated such date, as of such date and
based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the exchange ratio to be received by the
HSNi stockholders (other than Liberty Interactive, a significant stockholder of Liberty Interactive, and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement.
For a description of these reports, see "Special Factors—Opinion of the Special Committee Financial Advisor (Centerview Partners)" and "—Opinion of the
Special Committee Financial Advisor (Goldman Sachs)", respectively. 

Q: What constitutes a quorum? 

A: The holders of a majority of the voting power of all of the shares of HSNi common stock entitled to vote at the HSNi special meeting, present in person or
represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at the HSNi special meeting. For purposes of determining a quorum, your shares will be included as represented at
the meeting even if your proxy indicates that you abstain from voting. If a broker who is a record holder of shares indicates on a form of proxy that the broker does
not have discretionary authority to vote those shares, or if those shares are voted in circumstances in which proxy authority is defective or has been withheld, those
shares will not be treated as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. 

Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 

A: If your shares of HSNi common stock are registered directly in your name with HSNi's transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered the
stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and access to proxy materials is being provided directly to you. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage
account or by a bank or other nominee, then you are considered the beneficial owner of those shares, which are considered to be held in "street name." Access to
proxy materials is being provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee who is considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. 

Q: How can I vote my shares in person at the HSNi special meeting? 

A: Shares of HSNi common stock held directly in your name as the stockholder of record as of the close of business on the HSNi record date may be voted in person
at the HSNi special meeting. If you choose to attend the HSNi special meeting, you will need to bring valid, government-issued

photo identification. If you are a beneficial owner of HSNi common stock but not the stockholder of record of such shares, you will also need proof of stock
ownership to be admitted to the HSNi special meeting. A recent brokerage statement or a letter from a bank or broker are examples of proof of ownership. Please
note that if your shares are held in "street name" by a broker, bank or other nominee and you wish to vote at the HSNi special meeting, you will not be permitted to
vote in person unless you first obtain a legal proxy issued in your name from the record owner and present it to the inspector of election with your ballot at the
HSNi special meeting. To request a legal proxy, please contact your broker, bank or other nominee holder of record. It is suggested you do so in a timely manner to
ensure receipt of your legal proxy prior to the HSNi special meeting.

Failure to bring the appropriate documentation may delay your entry into or prevent you from attending the HSNi special meeting. The doors to the meeting room
will be closed promptly at the start of the meeting, and HSNi stockholders will not be permitted to enter after that time.

Q: How can I vote my shares without attending the special meeting? 

A: If you are a stockholder of record of HSNi common stock as of the close of business on the HSNi record date, you can vote by proxy via the internet, by telephone
or by mail by following the instructions provided in the enclosed proxy card. Please note that if you are a beneficial owner, you may vote by submitting voting
instructions to your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, or otherwise by following instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee.
Telephone and internet voting may be available to beneficial owner. Please refer to the vote instruction form provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee. 

Q: Can I change my vote after I have returned a proxy or voting instruction card or voted through the Internet or by telephone? 

A: Yes. If you are a stockholder of record of HSNi common stock as of the close of business on the HSNi record date, whether you vote by telephone, internet or mail,
you can change or revoke your proxy before it is voted at the HSNi special meeting by: 

• submitting a new proxy card bearing a later date; 

• voting again by telephone or the internet at a later time; 

• giving written notice of your revocation to the HSNi Corporate Secretary at the address provided above; or 

• voting in person at the HSNi special meeting. Please note that your attendance at the HSNi special meeting will not alone serve to revoke your proxy. 

If you are a beneficial owner of HSNi common stock as of the close of business on the HSNi record date, you must follow the instructions of your broker,
bank or other nominee to revoke or change your voting instructions.

Q: If my shares of HSNi common stock are held in "street name" by my bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, will my bank, brokerage firm or other
nominee automatically vote my shares for me? 

A: If you hold your shares of HSNi common stock in a stock brokerage account or if your shares are held by a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee (that is, in
"street name"), you must provide the record holder of your shares with instructions on how to vote your shares. Banks, brokerage firms or other nominees who hold
shares of HSNi common stock on behalf of their customers may not give a proxy to HSNi to vote those shares without specific instructions from their customers.

follow the voting instructions provided by your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee. Please note that you may not vote shares of HSNi common stock held in
street name by returning a proxy card directly to HSNi or by voting in person at the HSNi special meeting unless you provide a "legal proxy," which you must
obtain from your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee.

If you fail to instruct your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote your shares of HSNi common stock, your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee may not
vote your shares on the merger agreement proposal, the adjournment proposal or the non-binding compensation advisory proposal. This will have the same effect
as a vote against the merger agreement proposal, but it will have no effect on the adjournment proposal or the non-binding compensation advisory proposal,
assuming a quorum is present.

Q: What will happen if I fail to vote or I abstain from voting? 

A: If you are an HSNi stockholder and fail to vote, it will have the same effect as a vote against the merger agreement proposal, but, assuming a quorum is present, it
will have no effect on the adjournment proposal or the non-binding compensation advisory proposal. If you are an HSNi stockholder and you abstain from voting,
it will have the same effect as a vote against the merger agreement proposal, but it will have no effect on the adjournment proposal and the non-binding
compensation advisory proposal. 

Q: If an HSNi stockholder gives a proxy, how will the shares of HSNi common stock covered by the proxy be voted? 

A: If you provide a proxy, regardless of whether you provide that proxy by phone, via the internet or by completing and returning the applicable enclosed proxy card,
the individuals named on the enclosed proxy card will vote your shares of HSNi common stock in the way that you indicate when providing your proxy in respect
of the shares of HSNi common stock. When completing the internet or telephone processes or the proxy card, you may specify whether your shares of HSNi
common stock should be voted for or against, or abstain from voting on, all, some or none of the specific items of business to come before the HSNi special
meeting. 

Q: How will my shares of HSNi common stock be voted if I return a blank proxy? 

A: If you sign, date and return your proxy and do not indicate how you want your shares of HSNi common stock to be voted, then your shares of HSNi common stock
will be voted "FOR" the merger agreement proposal, "FOR" the adjournment proposal if necessary to solicit additional proxies in favor of the approval of the
merger agreement and "FOR" the non-binding compensation advisory proposal. 

Q: What should I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials? 

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials relating to the HSNi special meeting if you hold shares of HSNi stock in "street name" and also directly in
your name as a stockholder of record or otherwise or if you hold shares of HSNi common stock in more than one brokerage account. If you do receive more than
one set of voting materials, you should follow the appropriate procedures in each set of voting materials to ensure that you vote all of your shares. 

Direct holders (stockholders of record)

For shares of HSNi common stock held directly, please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card (or cast your vote by telephone or internet as provided on
each proxy card) or otherwise follow the voting instructions provided in this proxy statement/prospectus in order to ensure that all of your shares of HSNi common
stock are voted.

Holders of shares in "street name"

For shares of HSNi common stock held in "street name" through a bank, brokerage firm or other nominee, you should follow the procedures provided by your
bank, brokerage firm or other nominee to vote your shares.

Q: What happens if I sell my shares of HSNi common stock before the HSNi special meeting? 

A: The HSNi record date for HSNi stockholders entitled to vote at the HSNi special meeting is earlier than the date of the HSNi special meeting. If you transfer your
shares of HSNi common stock after the HSNi record date but before the HSNi special meeting, you will, unless special arrangements are made, retain your right to
vote at the HSNi special meeting but will have transferred the right to receive the merger consideration in connection with the merger to the person to whom you
transferred your shares of HSNi common stock. 

Q: Are HSNi stockholders entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger? 

A: No. Under Delaware law, HSNi stockholders are not entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger. For more information regarding appraisal rights, see
"Special Factors—No Appraisal Rights." 

Q: Has Liberty Interactive agreed to vote its shares in favor of any of the proposals to be considered at the HSNi special meeting? 

A: Yes. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Liberty Interactive agreed to vote the shares of HSNi common stock it beneficially owns in favor of the adoption of the
merger agreement, in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone the HSNi special meeting if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement and/or
if there are not sufficient shares present in person or by proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum, and in favor of any other matter necessary to consummate the
merger. 

As of the HSNi record date, Liberty Interactive beneficially owned approximately 38.2% of the outstanding shares of HSNi common stock.

For a discussion of Liberty Interactive's obligations to vote the shares of HSNi common stock it beneficially owns in favor of the merger, see "Special Factors—
The Merger Agreement—Liberty Interactive Voting Obligations."

Q: What do I need to do now? 

A: Carefully read and consider the information contained in and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, including its annexes, and return your
completed, signed and dated proxy card(s) by mail in the enclosed postage-paid envelope or submit your voting instructions by telephone or via the internet as soon
as possible so that your shares of HSNi common stock will be voted in accordance with your instructions. 

You should not submit your HSNi share certificates at this time.    After the merger is completed, if you held certificates representing shares of HSNi common
stock immediately prior to the effective time, the exchange agent will send you a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging your shares of HSNi common
stock for the merger consideration. Upon surrender of the certificates for cancellation and the executed letter of transmittal and other required documents described
in the instructions, an HSNi stockholder will receive the merger consideration.

Holders of shares of HSNi common stock in book-entry form immediately prior to the effective time will not need to take any action to receive the merger
consideration.

Q: Who is the exchange agent for the merger? 

A: Liberty Interactive has selected Computershare Trust Company, N.A. to act as the exchange agent in connection with the merger. 

Q: Who will solicit and pay the cost of soliciting proxies? 

A: HSNi has retained Georgeson LLC (Georgeson) to assist in the solicitation process. HSNi will pay Georgeson a fee of approximately $5,000, as well as reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket expenses. HSNi also has agreed to indemnify Georgeson against various liabilities and expenses that relate to or arise out of its
solicitation of proxies (subject to certain exceptions). 

Q: Will HSNi stockholders receive certificates representing shares of Liberty QVCA common stock following the merger? 

A: No. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, no physical certificates representing shares of Liberty QVCA common stock will be delivered to HSNi
stockholders. Instead, Liberty Interactive, with the assistance of the exchange agent, will electronically distribute shares of Liberty QVCA common stock in book-
entry form to such holder or its bank or brokerage firm on its behalf. If you are a record holder of HSNi common stock upon the effective time, the exchange agent
will mail you a book-entry account statement that reflects your shares of Liberty QVCA common stock. If you are a beneficial owner (but not a record holder) of
HSNi common stock upon the effective time, your bank or brokerage firm will credit your account with the shares of Liberty QVCA common stock that you are
entitled to receive. 

Q: Who can help answer my questions? 

A: HSNi stockholders who have questions about the merger or the matters to be voted on at the HSNi special meeting, or who desire additional copies of this proxy

SUMMARY 

        The following summary includes selected information contained elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus. This summary does not contain all of the important
information that you should consider before voting on the proposals. You should carefully read the entire proxy statement/prospectus, including the Annexes and the
documents incorporated by reference herein.

The Companies 

Liberty Interactive Corporation

        Liberty Interactive is a Delaware corporation and owns interests in companies primarily engaged in the video and online commerce industries. Through its
subsidiaries and affiliates, it operates in North America, Europe and Asia. Its principal businesses and assets include its consolidated subsidiaries QVC, Inc. (QVC),
zulily, llc (zulily) and Evite, Inc. (Evite) and its equity interests in FTD Companies, Inc. (FTD), HSNi, LendingTree, Inc. (LendingTree), Charter Communications, Inc.
(Charter) and Liberty Broadband Corporation (Liberty Broadband).

        Liberty Interactive's corporate structure includes two tracking stocks, each of which tracks a tracking stock group. Tracking stocks are a type of capital stock that the
issuing company intends to reflect or "track" the economic performance of a particular business or "group," rather than the economic performance of the company as a
whole. Each group has a separate collection of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to it, but no group is a separate legal entity and, therefore, no group can own
assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Liberty Interactive's two tracking stocks are the QVC Group common stock and the Liberty Ventures
common stock, which are intended to track and reflect the economic performance of the QVC Group and the Ventures Group, respectively. The QVC Group common
stock trades on Nasdaq under the ticker symbols "QVCA" and "QVCB," and the Liberty Ventures common stock trades on Nasdaq under the ticker symbols "LVNTA" and
"LVNTB."

        Currently, the QVC Group has attributed to it, among other things, Liberty Interactive's wholly-owned subsidiaries QVC and zulily and its approximately 38%
interest in HSNi, along with cash and certain liabilities. The Ventures Group has attributed to it, among other things, Liberty Interactive's equity interests in FTD,
LendingTree, Charter and Liberty Broadband, and certain liabilities relating to exchangeable debentures of Liberty LLC, along with cash and certain other liabilities.

        On April 4, 2017, Liberty Interactive, Liberty LLC and GCI entered into the GCI reorganization agreement whereby Liberty Interactive has agreed, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein, to acquire GCI through a reorganization in which certain Ventures Group assets and liabilities will be contributed to GCI in
exchange for a controlling interest in GCI. Liberty Interactive would then effect a tax-free split-off of its controlling interest in the combined company (to be named GCI
Liberty, Inc.) to the holders of Liberty Ventures common stock in full redemption of all outstanding shares of Liberty Ventures common stock. The GCI transactions
currently are expected to be consummated during the first quarter of 2018, subject to the satisfaction or waiver, if applicable or permitted, of the closing conditions set
forth in the GCI reorganization agreement. The completion of the merger is not a condition to the completion of the GCI transactions, nor is the completion of the GCI
transactions a condition to the completion of the merger.

        In connection with the GCI transactions, it is currently contemplated that the following assets and liabilities currently attributed to the Ventures Group will be
reattributed to the QVC Group (the reattribution):

• certain green energy assets attributed to the Ventures Group with an approximate value of $138 million;

Table of Contents

• certain private assets (Sound Ventures, Quid, Brit+Co and Liberty Israel Venture Fund II) with an approximate value of $75 million; 

• Liberty LLC's outstanding 4% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2029 in a principal amount of $435 million; 

• Liberty LLC's outstanding 3.75% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2030 in a principal amount of $435 million; 

• Liberty LLC's outstanding 3.5% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2031 in a principal amount of $328 million; 

• Liberty LLC's outstanding 0.75% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2043 in a principal amount of $1 million; 

• Liberty LLC's outstanding 1.75% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2046 in a principal amount of $750 million (the Liberty Charter Exchangeable
Debentures); 

• a certain amount of cash to be determined on the date of the reattribution (as further described below); 

• deferred tax liabilities and tax attributes relating to the exchangeable senior debentures described above and certain tax items related to Liberty Interactive's
repurchase of exchangeable debentures in prior years; 

• tax benefits relating to certain equity awards with respect to stock of Liberty Expedia Holdings, Inc. (Liberty Expedia), CommerceHub, Inc. and Liberty
TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc. (Liberty TripAdvisor); 

• 16,643,957 shares of common stock of ILG, Inc. (ILG); 

• 1,436 shares of common stock of Time, Inc.; and 

• 11,152 shares of common stock of Time Warner, Inc.

        The amount of cash to be reattributed to the QVC Group in the reattribution will depend on the fair value of the reattributed assets and liabilities as of the date of the
reattribution and will be equal to the amount by which the fair value of the aggregate liabilities to be reattributed to the QVC Group exceeds the fair value of the assets
(other than cash) to be reattributed to the QVC Group, in each case, as of the date of the reattribution.

        Liberty Interactive will complete the reattribution using similar valuation methodologies to those used in connection with its previous reattributions, including taking
into account the advice of its financial advisor, and in accordance with the Liberty Interactive charter and its Management and Allocation Policies (the Management and
Allocation Policies). The Management and Allocation Policies are designed to assist Liberty Interactive in managing and separately presenting the businesses and
operations attributed to its tracking stock groups. The board of directors of Liberty Interactive (the Liberty Interactive board) is vested with the discretion to reattribute
assets and liabilities that are attributed to one tracking stock group to the other tracking stock group without the approval of any of its stockholders. As contemplated by
both the Management and Allocation Policies and the Liberty Interactive charter, any reattribution of assets and/or liabilities must be done on a fair value basis, as
determined by the Liberty Interactive board. This means that (i) the Liberty Interactive board must determine the fair value of the assets and the liabilities to be reattributed
from one tracking stock group to the other, and (ii) the aggregate fair value of the assets to be reattributed must be equal to the aggregate fair value of the liabilities to be
reattributed at the same time. The intention of these requirements is to ensure that each tracking stock group is left with an equivalent fair value of assets

and liabilities before and after the reattribution. Any fair value determination made by the Liberty Interactive board is subject to the Liberty Interactive board's fiduciary
duties under applicable law.

        Unlike the assets described above which the Liberty Interactive board chose to reattribute, each series of publicly traded exchangeable debentures currently attributed
to the Ventures Group, including the Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures, is a debt security of Liberty LLC (which will remain a subsidiary of Liberty Interactive
following the closing of the GCI transactions) and it would be impermissible under the related indenture for these debt instruments to be contributed to GCI Liberty.
Accordingly, they must be reattributed to the QVC Group before the closing of the GCI transactions.

        Pursuant to the GCI reorganization agreement and an indemnification agreement to be entered into between Liberty Interactive and GCI Liberty in connection with
the closing of the GCI transactions (the GCI indemnification agreement), within six months of the closing of the GCI transactions, Liberty Interactive, Liberty LLC and
GCI Liberty will cooperate with, and reasonably assist each other with respect to, the commencement and consummation of a purchase offer (the purchase offer) whereby
Liberty LLC will offer to purchase, either pursuant to privately negotiated transactions or a tender offer, the Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures on terms and
conditions (including maximum offer price) reasonably acceptable to GCI Liberty. The Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures repurchased by Liberty LLC in the
purchase offer will be cancelled, and GCI Liberty's spread indemnity obligations with respect thereto (as described below) will be extinguished. GCI Liberty will
indemnify Liberty LLC for each Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debenture repurchased by Liberty LLC in the purchase offer in an amount equal to the difference between
(x) the purchase price paid by Liberty LLC to acquire such Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debenture in the purchase offer and (y) the sum of the amount of cash
reattributed with such purchased Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debenture in the reattribution plus the amount of certain tax benefits attributable to such Liberty Charter
Exchangeable Debenture so purchased. Additionally, Liberty LLC will be reimbursed by GCI Liberty for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Liberty LLC
relating to the completion of the purchase offer.

        Pursuant to the GCI indemnification agreement, GCI Liberty will indemnify Liberty LLC with respect to any Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures surrendered
for exchange to Liberty LLC on or before October 5, 2023 for the amount by which (x) the exchange value exceeds (y) the sum of the adjusted principal amount of such
Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures plus the amount of certain tax benefits attributable to such Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures so exchanged (the spread
indemnity). To support GCI Liberty's obligations under the GCI indemnification agreement, the reference shares related to the Liberty Charter Exchangeable Debentures
retained by Liberty LLC (consisting of shares of Class A common stock of Charter to be held by a subsidiary of GCI Liberty upon the closing of the GCI transactions) will
be subject to a negative pledge.

        No assurance can be given, however, that the GCI transactions or the purchase offer will be completed on the terms described above or at all.

RISK FACTORS 

        In addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus, including the matters addressed in "Cautionary Statement
Concerning Forward-Looking Statements," you should carefully consider the following risks before deciding how to vote. In addition, you should read and consider the risks
associated with each of the businesses of HSNi and Liberty Interactive because these risks will also affect the combined company following completion of the merger. These risks
can be found in the Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of each of Liberty Interactive and HSNi, each of which is filed with the SEC and
incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. You should also read and consider the other information in this proxy statement/prospectus and the other
documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. For more information, see "Additional Information—Where You Can Find More Information."

        If any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of
operations of (i) prior to the merger, Liberty Interactive and/or HSNi, as applicable, and (ii) after the merger, the combined company. In addition, past financial performance
may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

Risks Relating to the Merger 

         The merger is subject to a number of conditions, and may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.

        The consummation of the merger is subject to certain mutual conditions, including (i) the approval of the merger agreement proposal by the holders of at least a majority of
the outstanding aggregate voting power of HSNi common stock, voting together as a single class, (ii) the expiration or termination of any waiting period applicable to the
consummation of the merger under the HSR Act, (iii) the absence of any judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or other governmental authority that prohibits,
renders illegal or permanently enjoins the consummation of the merger, (iv) the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this proxy statement/prospectus
forms a part and (v) the authorization for listing of the shares of Liberty QVCA common stock issuable in the merger on Nasdaq (subject to official notice of issuance). The
obligation of each party to consummate the merger is also conditioned upon (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party as of the date of the merger
agreement and as of the closing (subject to, in certain cases, materiality and material adverse effect qualifiers), (ii) compliance by the other party in all material respects with its
pre-closing obligations under the merger agreement and (iii) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to the other party. Liberty Interactive's obligation to
consummate the merger is also conditioned upon (i) the receipt of the FCC Approvals and (ii) the rights plan amendment remaining in effect and having not been terminated,
amended or withdrawn.

        In addition, governmental authorities from which regulatory approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the merger or require changes to the terms
of the merger or the merger agreement, which could have the effect of delaying or impeding completion of the merger, or of imposing additional costs or limitations on Liberty
Interactive following completion of the merger.

        Liberty Interactive and HSNi cannot assure that the merger will be consummated on the terms or timeline currently contemplated or at all. Many of the conditions to the
closing of the merger are not within the control of Liberty Interactive or HSNi, and neither company can predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied. The failure to meet
all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the merger could
cause each of Liberty Interactive and HSNi not to realize some or all of the benefits that each expects to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected
timeframe.

         Failure to complete the merger could adversely affect the stock prices and the future business and financial results of Liberty Interactive and HSNi.

        If the merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of the HSNi stockholders failing to approve the merger agreement proposal, the ongoing businesses of
Liberty Interactive and/or HSNi may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, Liberty Interactive and HSNi will be
subject to numerous risks, including the following:

• Liberty Interactive or HSNi being required, under certain circumstances, to pay the other party a fee in connection with the termination of the merger agreement; 

• each of Liberty Interactive and HSNi having to pay substantial costs relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, filing, printing and mailing
fees that have already been incurred or will continue to be incurred until the closing of the merger or the earlier termination of the merger agreement; 

• Liberty Interactive and HSNi experiencing negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on their respective stock prices, or from their
respective customers, regulators and employees; 

• Liberty Interactive and HSNi having had to comply with restrictions on the conduct of their respective business prior to the completion of the merger, as set forth
in the merger agreement; and 

• reputational harm due to the adverse perception of any failure to successfully complete the merger.

         The exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted to reflect price changes of either Liberty QVCA common stock or HSNi common stock prior to the closing of the
merger.

        In the merger, each outstanding share of HSNi common stock (other than shares held by HSNi as treasury stock and shares held by Liberty Interactive or any of its wholly
owned subsidiaries) will automatically be converted into the exchange ratio of 1.650 shares of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Liberty QVCA common
stock. While the exchange ratio will be adjusted in certain limited circumstances set forth in the merger agreement, including a recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend or
distribution, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer or other similar transaction involving Liberty Interactive or HSNi, the exchange ratio is otherwise fixed and will
not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either Liberty QVCA common stock or HSNi common stock prior to the closing of the merger.

        The market prices of Liberty QVCA common stock and HSNi common stock have fluctuated since the date of the public announcement of the merger agreement and will
continue to fluctuate prior to, and in the case of Liberty QVCA common stock, after, completion of the merger. No assurance can be given concerning the market prices of
Liberty QVCA common stock or HSNi common stock before completion of the merger or of Liberty QVCA common stock after completion of the merger. Pursuant to the terms
of the merger agreement the exchange ratio is fixed, but the market price of Liberty QVCA common stock (and therefore the value of the merger consideration) to be received by
HSNi stockholders in the merger could be greater than, less than or the same as the prices shown in the table below after the merger is completed. Liberty QVCA and HSNi
stockholders are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for Liberty QVCA common stock and HSNi common stock and to review carefully the other information
contained in this proxy statement/prospectus or incorporated by reference herein. For more information, see "Additional Information—Where You Can Find More Information."

Table of Contents

        Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors (many of which are beyond the control of HSNi or Liberty Interactive), including the following:

• changes in, or changes in market expectations of, the respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities and prospects of, the QVC Group; 

• market expectations of the likelihood that the merger will be completed; 

• interest rates, general market and economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the price of Liberty QVCA common stock; 

• federal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the businesses in which the QVC Group operates; and 

• other factors beyond the control of Liberty Interactive, including those described under this heading "Risk Factors."

        The price of Liberty QVCA common stock at the closing of the merger may vary from the price of Liberty QVCA common stock on the date the merger agreement was
executed, on the date of this proxy statement/prospectus and on the date of the HSNi special meeting. As a result, the market value of the merger consideration will also vary. For
example, based on the range of closing prices of Liberty QVCA common stock during the period from July 5, 2017, the last trading day before public announcement of the
merger, through November 24, 2017, the latest practicable date before the filing of this proxy statement/prospectus, the merger consideration represented a market value per share
of HSNi common stock ranging from a low of $34.30 to a high of $42.90.

        Because the merger will be completed, if at all, after the HSNi special meeting, the exact market value of the shares of Liberty QVCA common stock that HSNi
stockholders will receive upon completion of the merger cannot be known at the time of the HSNi special meeting.

        Therefore, while the number of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock to be issued per share of HSNi common stock is fixed, at the time they consider and vote upon the
merger agreement proposal HSNi stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the merger consideration they will receive upon completion of the merger.

         HSNi stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in the combined company following the merger, and will exercise less influence over management
of the combined company.

        Because shares of Liberty QVCA common stock to be received by HSNi stockholders in the merger will not represent the same proportionate equity and voting interests as
their existing shares of HSNi common stock represent in HSNi, this will result in HSNi stockholders having less influence over the management of the combined company.
Based upon the number of outstanding shares on the HSNi record date for the HSNi special meeting, upon completion of the merger, we expect that former HSNi stockholders
will own approximately 11.1% of the undiluted equity and 7.2% of the undiluted voting power of the QVC Group (based on the number of shares outstanding on October 31,
2017, the last practicable date prior to the date of filing this proxy statement/prospectus).

        It is also important to note that in light of Liberty Interactive's tracking stock structure, former HSNi stockholders will own approximately 6.2% of the aggregate voting
power of Liberty Interactive on a consolidated basis, after taking into account the outstanding shares of Liberty Ventures common stock (based on the number of shares
outstanding on October 31, 2017, the last practicable date prior to the date of filing this proxy statement/prospectus). Holders of QVC Group common stock and Liberty Ventures
common stock generally vote together on all matters brought to a vote of the stockholders of Liberty Interactive, except as otherwise required by the Liberty Interactive charter or
applicable Delaware law. See "Comparison of Stockholders' Rights."

Table of Contents

        Consequently, holders of QVC Group common stock and HSNi common stock, as a general matter, will have less influence over the management and policies of Liberty
Interactive after the completion of the merger than they currently exercise over the management and policies of Liberty Interactive and HSNi, respectively.

         Liberty Interactive and HSNi expect to incur significant costs and expenses in connection with the merger.

        Each of Liberty Interactive and HSNi have incurred, and expect to further incur, certain nonrecurring costs in connection with the consummation of the merger, including
advisory, legal and other transaction costs. A majority of these costs have already been incurred or will be incurred regardless of whether the merger is completed. While many of
the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time, management of Liberty Interactive and HSNi continue to assess the
magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in connection with the merger. Although Liberty Interactive and HSNi expect that the realization of
benefits related to the merger will offset such costs and expenses over time, no assurances can be made that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all. See
"Special Factors—Amount and Source of Funds and Financing of the Merger; Expenses."

         The announcement and pendency of the merger could divert the attention of management and cause disruptions in the businesses of HSNi and Liberty Interactive,
which could have an adverse effect on the business and financial results of both HSNi and the QVC Group.

        Liberty Interactive and HSNi are currently operated independently of each other. Management of both HSNi and Liberty Interactive may be required to divert a
disproportionate amount of attention away from their respective day-to-day activities and operations, and devote time and effort to consummating the merger. The risks, and
adverse effects, of such disruptions and diversions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the merger. These factors could adversely affect the financial position or
results of operations of the QVC Group and HSNi, regardless of whether the merger is completed.

         HSNi is subject to contractual restrictions while the merger is pending, which could adversely affect HSNi's business.

        The merger agreement imposes certain restrictive interim covenants on HSNi. For instance, the consent of Liberty Interactive is required in respect of, among other things,
amendments to HSNi's organizational documents, share repurchases, certain actions relating to material contracts, certain employee benefit changes, certain capital expenditures
and dispositions, payments of dividends, and certain issuances of shares of HSNi common stock. These restrictions may prevent HSNi from taking certain actions before the
closing of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement, including making certain acquisitions or otherwise pursuing certain business opportunities, or making certain
changes to its capital stock, that the HSNi board may deem beneficial.

         Liberty Interactive is subject to contractual restrictions while the merger is pending, which could adversely affect Liberty Interactive's business.

        Although less restrictive than those imposed on HSNi, the merger agreement does impose certain restrictive interim covenants on Liberty Interactive. For instance, the
consent of HSNi is required in respect of, among other things, amendments to Liberty Interactive's organizational documents, certain payments of dividends with respect to
shares of QVC Group common stock and certain issuances of shares of QVC Group common stock. These restrictions may prevent Liberty Interactive from taking certain actions
before the closing of the merger or the termination of the merger agreement, including completing certain capital raising activities that the Liberty Interactive board may deem
beneficial.

Table of Contents

         The merger agreement limits HSNi's ability to pursue alternative transactions.

        The merger agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting an acquisition proposal to HSNi that might result in greater value to the HSNi
stockholders than the merger, or may result in a potential acquiror of HSNi proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire HSNi than it might otherwise have proposed to
pay. These provisions include a general prohibition on HSNi soliciting or, subject to certain exceptions relating to the exercise of fiduciary duties by the HSNi board, entering
into discussions with third parties regarding alternative transactions. In addition, pursuant to the merger agreement, HSNi has an unqualified obligation to submit the merger
agreement proposal to a vote by the HSNi stockholders, even if HSNi receives an alternative transaction proposal that the HSNi board believes is superior to the merger, unless
Liberty Interactive or HSNi, as applicable, terminates the merger agreement in accordance with its terms prior to such time. See "Special Factors—The Merger Agreement—
Termination of the Merger Agreement."

         Certain provisions of the merger agreement could discourage a potential competing acquiror of HSNi or could result in any competing proposal being offered at a
lower price than it might otherwise be.

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, HSNi may not solicit alternative transaction proposals, and HSNi may only engage with a competitive acquiror if the HSNi board
receives a bona fide alternative transaction proposal that did not result from a material breach of its non-solicitation obligations and which the HSNi board determines to be, or to
be reasonably expected to lead to, a superior transaction proposal, and the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary
duties, subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement. The merger agreement can be terminated by HSNi in order to enter into a superior transaction with a third
party, but only subject to compliance with certain terms and conditions included in the merger agreement and upon payment of a termination fee of $40 million to Liberty
Interactive. For more information, see "Special Factors—The Merger Agreement—No Solicitation."

        These provisions could discourage a potential competing acquiror that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of HSNi from considering or proposing
such an acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share value than the value proposed to be received in the merger, or might result in a potential
competing acquiror proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in
certain circumstances under the merger agreement.

         The pendency of the merger could adversely affect the business and operations of the QVC Group and HSNi.

        In connection with the pending merger, some customers or vendors of each of the QVC Group and HSNi may delay or defer decisions. Similarly, current and prospective
employees of HSNi may experience uncertainty about their future roles with HSNi following the merger, which may materially adversely affect the ability of HSNi to attract and
retain key personnel during the pendency of the merger. In particular, HSNi does not currently have a full-time chief executive officer, and the merger agreement imposes certain
limitations on HSNi's ability to fill such position. In addition, due to operating covenants in the merger agreement, HSNi and, in some cases, Liberty Interactive, may be unable
(without the other party's prior written consent), during the pendency of the merger, to pursue strategic transactions, undertake significant capital projects, undertake certain
significant financing transactions and otherwise pursue other actions, even if such actions would prove beneficial. The risks, and adverse effects, of such disruptions could be
exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.

         Some of the directors and executive officers of HSNi have interests in seeing the merger completed that are different from, or in addition to, those of the HSNi
stockholders.

        Directors and executive officers of HSNi may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of HSNi stockholders generally. These
interests include, among others, the treatment of outstanding equity awards pursuant to the merger agreement, potential severance and other benefits upon a qualifying
termination in connection with the merger, Liberty Interactive's agreement to appoint one member of the HSNi board (other than a director designated by Liberty Interactive) to
the Liberty Interactive board at the closing, and certain rights to ongoing indemnification and insurance coverage. Additionally, Ms. Chun, who is a Liberty Interactive employee,
and Mr. Costello are Liberty Interactive's designees on the HSNi board and were designated by Liberty Interactive pursuant to the Spinco Agreement (as further described in
"Special Factors—Interests of Certain Persons of HSNi in the Merger)."

         If the merger is not consummated by April 5, 2018 (unless extended under certain circumstances), either Liberty Interactive or HSNi may terminate the merger
agreement.

        Either Liberty Interactive or HSNi may terminate the merger agreement if the merger has not been consummated by the outside date of April 5, 2018, subject to a six month
extension by either Liberty Interactive or HSNi if the only closing condition(s) that have not been satisfied are related to the receipt of antitrust or FCC Approvals. However, this
termination right will not be available to a party that failed to fulfill its obligations under the merger agreement and such failure was the cause of, or resulted in, the failure to
consummate the merger. No termination fee is payable by either party for a termination of the merger agreement, except in limited circumstances.

        HSNi will pay Liberty Interactive a termination fee of $40 million (i) if an alternative transaction proposal is made to HSNi, (ii) thereafter the merger agreement is
terminated by either party for failure to consummate the merger by the outside date (at such time as the HSNi stockholders have failed to approve the transactions), and
(iii) within 15 months of such termination, HSNi enters into an alternative transaction and such alternative transaction is consummated.

        Similarly, Liberty Interactive will pay HSNi a termination fee of $75 million (i) if the merger has not been consummated on or before the outside date (as it may be
extended) as a result of the required regulatory approvals having not been obtained or (ii) if any court or other governmental authority has issued an order or taken any other
action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger under any competition law or the Communications Act and such order or other action is, or has
become, final and non-appealable. For more information, see "Special Factors—The Merger Agreement—Termination of the Merger Agreement."

         Sales of Liberty QVCA common stock after the completion of the merger may cause the market price of Liberty QVCA common stock shares to fall.

        Based upon the number of outstanding shares of HSNi common stock on the HSNi record date, we expect that Liberty Interactive will issue approximately 53.5 million
shares of Liberty QVCA common stock in the merger.

        Many former HSNi stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of Liberty QVCA common stock they will receive in the merger. Such sales of Liberty QVCA common
stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for Liberty QVCA common stock, and may take place promptly following the merger.

         The Liberty QVCA common stock to be received by HSNi stockholders in the merger will have rights different from shares of HSNi common stock, and in the event the
merger is completed prior to the closing of the GCI transactions (or in the event the GCI transactions are not completed at all), HSNi stockholders receiving Liberty QVCA
common stock will be subject to risks specific to holders of Liberty Interactive tracking stock, including the ability of its board to reattribute assets and liabilities between its
tracking stock groups.

        Upon completion of the merger, HSNi stockholders will no longer hold shares of HSNi common stock but will instead become holders of shares of Liberty QVCA common
stock, and their rights as stockholders of Liberty Interactive will be governed by the terms of the Liberty Interactive charter, the amended and restated bylaws of Liberty
Interactive (the Liberty Interactive bylaws) and by the DGCL. The terms of the Liberty Interactive charter are in many respects different from the terms of the HSNi charter and
the amended and restated bylaws of HSNi (the HSNi bylaws). See "Comparison of Stockholders' Rights" for a discussion of the different rights associated with Liberty QVCA
common stock. In particular, Liberty QVCA common stock is a tracking stock of Liberty Interactive, and includes terms that are specific to tracking stock and would not
typically apply to regular common stock, specifically, in this case, the HSNi common stock. Thus, holders of tracking stock are subject to risks that are different from the risks to
which holders of traditional common stock are subject. See "Item IA. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Ownership of Our Common Stock due to our Tracking Stock
Capitalization" for more information regarding risks specific to ownership of tracking stock (the tracking stock risks) in Liberty Interactive's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed
with the SEC and which is incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.

        As a result of the GCI transactions, following the full redemption of the Liberty Ventures common stock, the QVC Group common stock will cease to function as a tracking
stock and will effectively become an asset-backed stock, even though Liberty Interactive's tracking stock structure will remain in place until the Liberty Interactive charter is
amended to eliminate tracking stock specific provisions. Thus, if the merger were to close following the completion of the GCI transactions, risks applicable to holders of Liberty
QVCA common stock that are specific to the nature of tracking stocks would cease to apply. However, in the event the merger occurs prior to the completion of the GCI
transactions, then HSNi stockholders receiving shares of Liberty QVCA common stock in the merger would be subject to risks specific to tracking stocks in the interim period
(or, in the event the GCI transactions do not occur, for an unknowable period of time). These risks would include, but are not limited to, holders of Liberty QVCA common stock,
as stockholders of Liberty Interactive, being subject to risks associated with an investment in Liberty Interactive as a whole, even if a holder does not also own shares of Liberty
Ventures common stock; the market price of Liberty QVCA common stock being adversely affected or fluctuating substantially due to factors that do not affect traditional
common stock; and holders of one tracking stock group potentially not having any remedies if an action by the Liberty Interactive board or Liberty Interactive officers has an
adverse effect on only that stock.

        In addition, the Liberty Interactive board is vested with the ability to reattribute assets and liabilities between tracking stock groups without stockholder approval. As
described below, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, HSNi has the right to consent to certain amendments to the terms of the GCI transactions, which would include
certain changes in the composition of assets and liabilities remaining at Liberty Interactive following the completion of the GCI transactions. However, once the merger has
closed, HSNi will no longer have this contractual right. For example, in the event that, following the merger, the Liberty Interactive board were to determine to make certain
changes to the composition of the assets and liabilities to be reattributed to the QVC Group in connection with the completion of the GCI transactions, such a change in the
reattribution would not require the consent of HSNi, nor would it be subject to any vote of Liberty Interactive's stockholders (which, at such time, would include former HSNi
stockholders) (even if such a change would have triggered a consent right in favor of HSNi prior to the completion of the merger).

        HSNi stockholders are encouraged to review the tracking stock risks for more information regarding the risks specific to ownership of Liberty Interactive tracking stock.

         The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in this proxy statement/prospectus are for illustrative purposes and the actual financial
condition and results of operations after the merger may differ materially.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements in this document are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what
the combined company's actual financial condition or results of operations would have been had the merger been completed on the dates indicated. The unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements reflect adjustments, which are based upon assumptions and preliminary estimates, to record the HSNi identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at fair value and the resulting goodwill recognized. The purchase price allocation reflected in this document is preliminary, and final allocation of the purchase
price will be based upon the actual purchase price and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of HSNi as of the date of the completion of the merger. Accordingly, the final
acquisition accounting adjustments may differ materially from the pro forma adjustments reflected in this document. For more information, see "Unaudited Comparative Per
Share Information" and "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements" of this proxy statement/prospectus.

         The unaudited forecasted financial information of HSNi and the QVC Group included in this proxy statement/prospectus are presented for illustrative purposes only
and involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of HSNi and Liberty Interactive. As a result, it may not prove to be accurate and is
not necessarily indicative of current values or future performance.

        The unaudited forecasted financial information of HSNi and the QVC Group contained in "Special Factors—Unaudited Forecasted Financial Information" of this proxy
statement/prospectus involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions and is not a guarantee of future performance. The future financial results of the HSNi and the QVC Group
may materially differ from those expressed in the unaudited forecasted financial information due to factors that are beyond HSNi's and Liberty Interactive's respective ability to
control or predict. No assurances can be made regarding future events or that the assumptions made in preparing the unaudited forecasted financial information will accurately
reflect future conditions. The unaudited forecasted financial information was based on numerous variables and assumptions that are inherently subjective, and depend on a
number of factors, including risks and uncertainties relating to the businesses of HSNi and the QVC Group (including the ability of each to achieve strategic goals, objectives and
targets over applicable periods), industry performance, general business and economic conditions, and other factors described or incorporated by reference in this section or the
section entitled "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements," all of which are uncertain and many of which are beyond the control of HSNi and Liberty
Interactive, and, if the merger is completed, will be beyond the control of the combined company. Neither HSNi nor Liberty Interactive can provide any assurance that its future
financial results, or if the merger is completed, those of the combined company, will not materially vary from the unaudited forecasted financial information. The unaudited
forecasted financial information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement/prospectus are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on the unaudited forecasted financial information. The unaudited forecasted financial information covers multiple years, and the
information by its nature becomes subject to greater uncertainty with each successive year. The unaudited forecasted financial information does not take into account any
circumstances or events occurring after the date it was prepared.

        More specifically, the unaudited forecasted financial information:

• necessarily makes numerous assumptions, many of which are beyond the control of each company and may not prove to be accurate; 

• does not necessarily reflect changes in prospects for the businesses of HSNi and the QVC Group, changes in general business or economic conditions, or any
other transaction or event that has occurred or that may occur and that was not anticipated at the time the unaudited forecasted financial information was prepared;

• is not necessarily indicative of current values or future performance, which may be significantly more favorable or less favorable than is reflected in the unaudited
forecasted financial information; and 

• should not be regarded as a representation that the results reflected in the unaudited forecasted financial information will be achieved.

        The unaudited forecasted financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information or GAAP and does not reflect the effect of any proposed or other
changes in GAAP that may be made in the future.

        Neither Liberty Interactive nor HSNi intend to update or otherwise revise the unaudited forecasted financial information to reflect circumstances existing after the date when
made or reflect the occurrence of future events, even in the event that any or all of the assumptions underlying such unaudited forecasted financial information are no longer
appropriate, except as may be required by law.

         The fairness opinions obtained by the Special Committee from Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs will not reflect changes, circumstances, developments or
events that have occurred or may occur after the date of their respective opinions.

        On July 5, 2017, Centerview Partners rendered its oral opinion to the Special Committee (with the other Qualified Directors present), which was subsequently confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion dated such date, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications
and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview Partners in preparing its opinion, as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the merger consideration to be
received by the HSNi stockholders (other than as specified in such opinion) pursuant to the merger agreement.

        Also on July 5, 2017, Goldman Sachs rendered its oral opinion to the Special Committee (with the other Qualified Directors present), which was subsequently confirmed by
delivery of a written opinion dated such date, as of such date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, as to the fairness, from a financial point
of view, of the exchange ratio to be received by the HSNi stockholders (other than Liberty Interactive, a significant stockholder of Liberty Interactive, and their respective
affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement.

        Both financial advisor opinions were necessarily based on economic, market, financial and other conditions as they existed on, and on the information made available to
Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs as of the date of the opinion, including the unaudited forecasted financial information summarized in the section "Special Factors—

Partners' or Goldman Sachs' opinions were based, may alter the value of Liberty Interactive or HSNi or the prices of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock or shares of HSNi
common stock at the effective time. The value of the merger consideration to be received based on the exchange ratio has fluctuated since, and could be materially different from
its value as of, the date of Centerview Partners' and Goldman Sachs' opinions. Because HSNi does not currently anticipate asking its financial advisors to update their opinions,
their opinions will not address the fairness of the merger consideration from a financial point of view at the time the merger is completed, or at any other time other than the date
the opinions were delivered.

        For a more complete description of the opinions that Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs delivered, and a summary of the material financial analyses performed, in
connection with such opinions, please refer to the sections "Special Factors—Opinion of the Special Committee Financial Advisor (Centerview Partners)" and "—Opinion of the
Special Committee Financial Advisor (Goldman Sachs)," respectively. A copy of the opinion of Centerview Partners is attached as Annex C, a copy of the opinion of Goldman
Sachs is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement/prospectus, and each is incorporated by reference herein.

         HSNi stockholders receiving shares of Liberty QVCA common stock in the merger will be subject to the same risks relating to the GCI transactions to which current
holders of Liberty QVCA common stock are subject.

        Upon receiving shares of Liberty QVCA common stock in the merger, HSNi stockholders will become stockholders of Liberty Interactive and will be subject to certain risks
relating to the GCI transactions. Liberty Interactive believes that the GCI transactions will result in certain strategic and financial benefits for Liberty Interactive and its
stockholders, including, among other things, eliminating the complexity associated with Liberty Interactive's current tracking stock capital structure, which is expected to reduce
the discounts at which its capital stock trades and encourage investment in QVC Group common stock (in addition to the capital stock of GCI Liberty), and allowing Liberty
Interactive to achieve its goal of establishing a market-leading, pure-play retail and commerce business with its QVC Group, which should provide Liberty Interactive with a
more attractive equity currency that may also be eligible for inclusion in stock indices. However, no assurance can be given that the GCI transactions will be completed on a
timely basis or at all. If the GCI transactions are not completed, none of these benefits will be realized, the Liberty QVCA common stock will continue to constitute a tracking
stock of Liberty Interactive, and HSNi stockholders will be subject to all the risks and uncertainties relating to Liberty Interactive's tracking stock structure. Further, even if the
GCI transactions are completed, the anticipated benefits of the GCI transactions may not be realized fully or at all.

        In addition, Liberty Interactive expects to incur significant costs and expenses in connection with the GCI transactions, including advisory, legal and other transaction costs,
and no assurance can be given that the benefits related to the GCI transactions will offset such costs and expenses over time or offset any adverse effect on the financial position
or results of operations of Liberty Interactive, or the QVC Group more specifically, due to the diversion of management's attention resulting from the announcement or pendency
of the GCI transactions. In addition, Liberty Interactive is subject to certain restrictions while the GCI transactions are pending, which may prevent Liberty Interactive from
taking certain actions before the closing of the GCI transactions, including completing certain capital raising activities that the Liberty Interactive board may consider beneficial.

        In addition, pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, HSNi has a contractual right to consent to certain amendments to the terms of the GCI transactions prior to the
completion of the merger. However, following the completion of the merger, this contractual right will fall away, and Liberty Interactive and GCI will be permitted to change the
terms of the GCI transaction as and to the extent they mutually determine. Thus, HSNi stockholders receiving shares of Liberty QVCA common

stock could be adversely impacted by changes in the GCI transactions that, but for the completion of the merger, may not have been permitted without the consent of HSNi. In
the event any material amendments are made to the terms of the GCI transactions prior to its completion, whether before or following the completion of the merger, Liberty
Interactive intends to promptly issue a press release and/or file a Current Report on Form 8-K to report such event.

         The GCI transactions could result in a significant tax liability to Liberty Interactive.

        It is a condition to the GCI transactions that Liberty Interactive receive the opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (Skadden Arps), in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Liberty Interactive, to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the GCI transactions will qualify as a tax-free transaction to Liberty
Interactive and holders of Liberty Ventures common stock under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Code.

        The opinion of Skadden Arps will be based on the law in effect as of the time of the GCI transactions and will rely upon certain assumptions, as well as statements,
representations and undertakings made by officers of Liberty Interactive, GCI Liberty and Mr. John C. Malone. These assumptions, statements, representations and undertakings
are expected to relate to, among other things, Liberty Interactive's and GCI Liberty's business reasons for engaging in the GCI transactions, the conduct of certain business
activities by Liberty Interactive and GCI Liberty, and the plans and intentions of Liberty Interactive and GCI Liberty to continue conducting those business activities and not to
materially modify their ownership or capital structure following the GCI transactions. If any of those statements, representations or assumptions is incorrect or untrue in any
material respect or any of those undertakings is not complied with, or if the facts upon which the opinion is based are materially different from the actual facts that exist at the
time of the GCI transactions, the conclusions reached in such opinion could be adversely affected.

        Liberty Interactive does not intend to seek a ruling from the IRS as to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the GCI transactions. The legal authorities upon which the
opinion of Skadden Arps will be based are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. The opinion of Skadden Arps will not be
binding on courts or the IRS, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion or that a court would not sustain such a
challenge.

        Even if the GCI transactions otherwise qualify under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Code, the GCI transactions would result in a significant
U.S. federal income tax liability to Liberty Interactive (but not to holders of Liberty Ventures common stock) under Section 355(e) of the Code if one or more persons acquire,
directly or indirectly, a 50% or greater interest (measured by either vote or value) in the stock of Liberty Interactive or in the stock of GCI Liberty (or any successor corporation)
(excluding, for this purpose, the acquisition of GCI Liberty common stock by Liberty Interactive in the GCI transactions and by holders of Liberty Ventures common stock in the
GCI transactions) as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the GCI transactions. Any acquisition of the stock of Liberty Interactive or GCI Liberty (or any
successor corporation) within two years before or after the GCI transactions would generally be presumed to be part of a plan that includes the GCI transactions, although the
parties may be able to rebut that presumption under certain circumstances. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex,
inherently factual in nature and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Notwithstanding the opinion of Skadden Arps described
above, Liberty Interactive or GCI Liberty might inadvertently cause or permit a prohibited change in ownership of Liberty Interactive or GCI Liberty, thereby triggering tax
liability to Liberty Interactive, which could have a material adverse effect.

Table of Contents

        Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement that Liberty Interactive will enter into with GCI Liberty in connection with the GCI transactions (the Tax Sharing Agreement), GCI
Liberty will be required to indemnify Liberty Interactive, its subsidiaries and certain related persons for taxes and losses resulting from the failure of the GCI transactions to
qualify as a tax-free transaction under Section 355, Section 368(a)(1)(D) and related provisions of the Code to the extent that such taxes and losses (i) result primarily from,
individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain covenants made by GCI Liberty (applicable to actions or failures to act by GCI Liberty and its subsidiaries following the
completion of the GCI transactions) or (ii) result from the application of Section 355(e) of the Code to the GCI transactions as a result of the treatment of the GCI transactions as
part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, a 50% or greater interest (measured by vote or value) in the
stock of GCI Liberty (or any successor corporation).

        If it is subsequently determined that the GCI transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment, and GCI Liberty does not have an obligation to indemnify Liberty Interactive
under the Tax Sharing Agreement for tax liabilities incurred as a result of the GCI transactions or GCI Liberty fails to comply with its indemnification obligations, Liberty
Interactive could incur significant tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect. Further, in light of the requirements under Section 355 of the Code, Liberty
Interactive might determine to forgo certain transactions, including stock issuances, certain asset dispositions and other strategic transactions for some period of time following
the GCI transactions.

         The completion of the merger is not conditioned on the receipt of an opinion of counsel to the effect that the merger will qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment, and no
ruling has been or will be sought from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger.

        It is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, which we refer to as
the Intended Tax Treatment. However, the completion of the merger is not conditioned on the merger qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment or upon the receipt of an opinion
of counsel to that effect. In addition, neither Liberty Interactive nor HSNi intends to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the merger will qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment. Further, even if Liberty Interactive and HSNi conclude that the
merger qualifies for the Intended Tax Treatment, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge that conclusion or that a court would not sustain such a challenge.
Each HSNi stockholder should read the discussion under "Special Factors—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" and should consult its own tax advisor for a full
understanding of the tax consequences of the merger to such stockholder.

Risks Relating to the Combined Company After Completion of the Merger 

         Following the merger, Liberty Interactive may be unable to integrate the businesses of QVC and HSNi successfully or realize the anticipated synergies and related
benefits of the merger or do so within the anticipated time frame.

        The merger involves the combination of two companies which currently operate as independent companies. Liberty Interactive will be required to devote significant
management attention and resources to integrating the businesses and operations of HSNi. Potential difficulties QVC or HSNi may encounter in the integration process include
the following:

• the inability to successfully combine the businesses of QVC and HSNi in a manner that permits Liberty Interactive to achieve the benefits anticipated to result
from the merger, in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;

Table of Contents

• the complexities associated with managing QVC and HSNi out of several different locations and integrating personnel from the two companies; 

• the additional complexities of combining two companies with different histories, cultures, regulatory restrictions, markets and customer bases; 

• the failure by Liberty Interactive to retain key employees of either QVC or HSNi; 

• potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger; and 

• performance shortfalls at one or both of the two companies as a result of the diversion of management's attention in connection with completing the merger and
integrating the companies' operations.

        For all these reasons, you should be aware that it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of QVC's or HSNi's management, the disruption of
Liberty Interactive's ongoing business or inconsistencies in Liberty Interactive's services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the
ability of Liberty Interactive to maintain relationships with customers, vendors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, or could otherwise adversely
affect the business and financial results of Liberty Interactive following the merger.

         Following the merger, Liberty Interactive does not expect to pay dividends.

        Liberty Interactive expects that, following the merger, it will not continue HSNi's quarterly dividend payments. Liberty Interactive has not paid any cash dividends on shares
of QVC Group common stock, and has no present intention of so doing. Payment of dividends, if any, in the future will be determined by the Liberty Interactive board in light of
earnings, financial condition and other relevant considerations.

SPECIAL FACTORS 

        The following is a discussion of the merger and the material terms of the merger agreement by and among Liberty Interactive, Merger Sub and HSNi. This discussion is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, and you are urged to read the merger agreement carefully and in its entirety, a copy of which is attached as Annex A
to this proxy statement/prospectus and incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus.

Background of the Merger 

        The following chronology summarizes the key meetings and events that led to the signing of the merger agreement. The following chronology does not purport to catalogue
every conversation among the HSNi board or Liberty Interactive board, or the representatives of each company, their respective advisors or any other persons.

        The HSNi board and HSNi management regularly review and assess HSNi's operations, performance, prospects and strategic direction, and evaluate the possibility of
pursuing various strategic transactions and other strategic alternatives as part of ongoing efforts to strengthen the business and enhance stockholder value, while taking into
account economic, regulatory, competitive and other conditions.

        On December 9, 2016, Mr. Gregory B. Maffei, Liberty Interactive's President and Chief Executive Officer, telephoned Mr. Arthur C. Martinez, Chairman of the HSNi board,
to discuss the retail industry generally, and the possibility of a potential strategic transaction involving Liberty Interactive and HSNi. Mr. Maffei expressed his view that
combining the two companies in an all-stock transaction could provide significant benefits to both Liberty Interactive and the HSNi stockholders, and that he believed any
takeover premium had already been priced in to HSNi's current trading price. Mr. Martinez advised Mr. Maffei that he would relay the discussion to the HSNi board and respond
to Mr. Maffei in due course.

        On December 14, 2016, the HSNi board (with the exception of Ms. Chun and Mr. Costello, Liberty Interactive's nominees on the HSNi board, who agreed to recuse
themselves from this meeting) held a meeting during which Mr. Martinez informed the HSNi board of his discussion with Mr. Maffei. A representative of Davis Polk &
Wardwell LLP (Davis Polk), participated in the meeting and reviewed with the HSNi board certain legal matters including the directors' fiduciary duties in connection with their
consideration of a potential strategic transaction and the terms of the Spinco Agreement with Liberty Interactive (which is described in more detail in the section entitled "—
Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationship Between HSNi and Liberty Interactive—Spinco Agreement"). Following discussion, the HSNi board
approved resolutions authorizing the creation of the Special Committee, and vested it with the power to (i) review, evaluate and negotiate the terms and conditions of a potential
strategic transaction involving Liberty Interactive and, if the Special Committee deemed it appropriate, alternative transactions, including the possibility of a sale, merger or
recapitalization of all or any portion of HSNi, (ii) negotiate with Liberty Interactive any such potential transaction, (iii) negotiate with any other party or parties the terms of any
such alternative transaction, (iv) negotiate the terms of any definitive agreement with respect to any such transaction, the execution of which would be subject to the approval of
the HSNi board, (v) determine and recommend to the HSNi board whether any such potential transaction was advisable and fair to and in the best interests of the HSNi
stockholders and (vi) determine to elect not to pursue any such potential transaction. The HSNi board resolved not to recommend or approve any such transaction without a prior
favorable recommendation from the Special Committee. The HSNi board appointed Mr. James Follo, Mr. Martinez, and Mr. Thomas McInerney as the initial members of the
Special Committee, each of whom was determined by the HSNi board to be disinterested with respect to a potential strategic transaction involving Liberty Interactive and free of
any relationship that, in the opinion of the HSNi

board, would interfere with their independent judgment as a member of the Special Committee. The HSNi board then appointed Mr. Martinez as Chairman of the Special
Committee.

        On December 19, 2016, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting and authorized Mr. Martinez to inform Mr. Maffei that HSNi had formed a special committee to
review and evaluate potential strategic transactions with Liberty Interactive and other potential third parties and was in the process of retaining a financial advisor. The Special
Committee then determined that Mr. Martinez should arrange interviews with multiple financial advisors, including Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs, to discuss their
interest and qualifications to serve as a financial advisor to the Special Committee in connection with a potential transaction. Representatives of Davis Polk then reviewed with
the Special Committee certain legal matters including the Special Committee's fiduciary duties in connection with their consideration of a potential strategic transaction and the
Special Committee's express authorization to retain legal counsel as it deemed necessary. Thereafter, all representatives of Davis Polk left the telephonic meeting. After
discussion, the Special Committee unanimously determined that it was advisable and in the best interests of HSNi and the HSNi stockholders to retain Davis Polk as independent
legal counsel to the Special Committee, based on its qualifications, experience and reputation and following disclosure to the Special Committee of Davis Polk's relationships
with HSNi.

        On December 22, 2016, Mr. Martinez telephoned Mr. Maffei to inform Mr. Maffei that HSNi had formed a special committee to review and evaluate potential strategic
transactions with Liberty Interactive and other potential third parties and was in the process of retaining financial advisors.

        On January 5, 2017, the Special Committee held a meeting. Representatives of Davis Polk participated in the meeting. At the invitation of the Special Committee,
representatives of Goldman Sachs joined the meeting. At the meeting, representatives of Goldman Sachs described their qualifications to serve as financial advisor to the Special
Committee, noting their prior experience working opposite Mr. Maffei and Liberty Interactive. Goldman Sachs presented the Special Committee with various strategies that
HSNi could pursue to maximize stockholder value. The Special Committee asked questions and discussed numerous aspects of the presentation, including, among others,
strategies for maximizing stockholder value when dealing with a significant stockholder and the implications of Liberty Interactive's tracking and low-vote stock. After the
representatives of Goldman Sachs were excused from the meeting, and at the request of the Special Committee, representatives of Centerview Partners joined the meeting.
Representatives of Centerview Partners described their qualifications to serve as financial advisor to the Special Committee, focusing in particular on prior experience working
opposite Mr. Maffei and Liberty Interactive, their familiarity with HSNi's business from prior work they had done for HSNi, and their involvement in other significant
stockholder situations. Centerview Partners presented the Special Committee with various strategies that HSNi could pursue to maximize stockholder value. The Special
Committee asked questions and discussed numerous aspects of the presentation, including, among others, strategies for maximizing stockholder value when dealing with a
significant stockholder and the implications of Liberty Interactive's tracking and low-vote stock. After the representatives of Centerview Partners were excused from the meeting,
the Special Committee reviewed and discussed the qualifications of each of Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners to serve as financial advisor to the Special Committee,
taking into account their prior experiences with each firm, the firms' and the deal teams' experience advising on complex transactions, particularly in the retail industry, and in
transactions involving Liberty Interactive and Mr. Maffei. The Special Committee also considered Centerview Partners' prior work for HSNi. The Special Committee then
reviewed each financial advisor's responses to a questionnaire regarding its and its affiliates' relationships with certain entities and individuals, including Liberty Interactive,
Mr. John C. Malone, Chairman of the Board of Liberty Interactive and Mr. Maffei. The Special Committee considered the facts and circumstances surrounding such relationships
in determining whether to engage Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs to provide financial advisory services to HSNi. The Special Committee discussed the benefits of

retaining more than one financial advisor. After discussion, the Special Committee unanimously determined it was advisable and in the best interests of HSNi and its stockholders
to retain both Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners as financial advisors to the Special Committee and authorized Mr. Martinez to retain both Goldman Sachs and Centerview
Partners.

        On January 13, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs participated in the meeting.
Mr. Martinez informed the Special Committee and its advisors that he had not been contacted by Mr. Maffei since their December 22, 2016 call, but that he had instructed HSNi's
then-current management to continue preparing HSNi's 2017 and 2018 financial plans expeditiously for presentation to the Qualified Directors as part of HSNi's regular January
2017 HSNi board meeting. Following discussion, the Special Committee directed Mr. Martinez to notify Mr. Maffei that the Special Committee had engaged financial advisors
and would be prepared to engage with Liberty Interactive in two to three weeks' time. Representatives of Davis Polk noted that Ms. Chun and Mr. Costello, Liberty Interactive's
nominees on the HSNi board, had agreed to recuse themselves from meetings or discussions relating to the ongoing strategic review process, including those regarding HSNi's
forecasts and valuation. Representatives of Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs then led a discussion regarding publicly available information regarding QVC.

        On January 18, 2017, Mr. Martinez informed Mr. Maffei that the Special Committee had retained Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs (which are sometimes referred to
collectively as the financial advisors) and that they were in the process of conducting their analysis.

        On January 30, 2017, the Qualified Directors held a meeting. Mr. Rod Little, Chief Financial Officer of HSNi, reviewed with the Qualified Directors HSNi's then-current
management projections for the years 2017 through 2021 for HSNi on a stand-alone basis, and the Special Committee approved the projections for use by the financial advisors
in connection with their analyses. Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs then joined for a portion of the meeting in order to review with the
Qualified Directors (i) HSNi's management projections in the context of historical performance, previous HSNi management estimates, Wall Street consensus estimates, and
retail company performance, (ii) retail industry trends and valuation, (iii) the potential importance of a transaction with HSNi for Liberty Interactive and the QVC Group and
(iv) the status of the Special Committee's strategic review process more broadly.

        On February 9, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs, and members of HSNi
management participated in the meeting. Mr. Martinez informed the Special Committee that Mr. Little had informed him that HSNi's revenue for January 2017 would be lower
than its revenue for January 2016. Representatives of Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs led a discussion regarding various aspects of HSNi's operating performance and
strategic environment, including a general overview of retail industry dynamics, public market perspectives on HSNi, a review of HSNi's stand-alone plan, a preliminary
financial analysis of HSNi, public market perspectives on QVC, a preliminary financial analysis of QVC, a pro forma evaluation of a potential combination of HSNi and QVC
based on publicly available data for QVC, and a preliminary evaluation of potential strategic alternatives, including a break-up of HSNi through a sale of its Cornerstone business
division, a re-purchase of Liberty Interactive's ownership of HSNi and the sale of HSNi to a potential third party. The Special Committee discussed the extent to which HSNi's
current stock price reflected a premium associated with the market's expectation that QVC would eventually acquire 100% of HSNi and the value of any cost and revenue
synergies that could result from a possible combination of HSNi and QVC. Following discussion, the Special Committee determined to engage in further discussions with Liberty
Interactive and that Mr. Martinez would contact Mr. Maffei to advise him that HSNi was now prepared to discuss a possible strategic transaction.

        On February 14, 2017, Mr. Martinez telephoned Mr. Maffei to inform him that HSNi was prepared to discuss a possible strategic transaction, but that any such transaction
would need to adequately compensate the HSNi stockholders for the value of any synergies derived from the transaction and for the change of control. Mr. Maffei requested
information regarding HSNi's current business plan. Mr. Martinez informed Mr. Maffei that HSNi was not willing to share that information at this stage, and asked Mr. Maffei to
provide an initial indication regarding value. Mr. Maffei informed Mr. Martinez that he would be in touch to propose a process for further engagement. Later on February 14,
2017, Mr. Martinez provided a telephonic update to the Special Committee, along with representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs, regarding his
discussion with Mr. Maffei.

        On February 16, 2017, Mr. Maffei telephoned Mr. Martinez to inform him that he intended to contact the Special Committee's financial advisors on February 21, 2017 to
discuss a possible strategic transaction between HSNi and Liberty Interactive.

        On February 21, 2017, Mr. Maffei telephoned representatives of Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs to inform them that Liberty Interactive expected to create an asset-
based stock for QVC, zulily and HSNi, which he believed would be eligible for possible inclusion in stock indices and trade at a premium relative to the QVC Group tracking
stock.

        Later on February 21, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic discussion that included representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs. The
representatives of the financial advisors updated the Special Committee regarding their earlier conversation with Mr. Maffei relating to the creation of an asset-based stock for
QVC, zulily and HSNi. The representatives of Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs also informed the Special Committee that they impressed upon Mr. Maffei the Special
Committee's view that the HSNi stockholders receive an appropriate control premium and share of the value of any synergies resulting from any potential transaction involving
HSNi and Liberty Interactive.

        On February 24, 2017, representatives of Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs called Mr. Maffei to follow-up on the February 16, 2017 discussion between
Mr. Martinez and Mr. Maffei. During the call, Mr. Maffei indicated that Liberty Interactive would be in touch in the next two to three weeks to discuss a strategic transaction
involving HSNi and Liberty Interactive.

        Also on February 24, 2017, the HSNi board held its regular quarterly meeting. Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs joined for a portion
of the meeting in order to update the members of the HSNi board on their analyses, including HSNi's recent performance, the Special Committee's strategic review process more
broadly, and potential strategic alternatives for HSNi that had been previously discussed with the Special Committee. Ms. Chun and Mr. Costello recused themselves from this
portion of the meeting. Representatives of Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs informed the Qualified Directors that they had conveyed to Mr. Maffei the Special
Committee's view that any transaction involving Liberty Interactive should provide the HSNi stockholders with an appropriate control premium and share of the resulting
synergies.

        On March 9, 2017, the Qualified Directors held a follow-up meeting with representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs. Representatives of
Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs updated the Qualified Directors regarding recent stock price performance for HSNi, the QVC Group and other retail companies, an
update on the preliminary financial analysis of HSNi and the QVC Group and the status of the Special Committee's evaluation of potential strategic alternatives.

        Also on March 9, 2017, Mr. Maffei called a representative of Goldman Sachs to further outline his expectations for a potential transaction with HSNi. Mr. Maffei informed
the representative of Goldman Sachs of his view that the HSNi common stock was overvalued by the market, while the Liberty QVCA common stock was undervalued by the
market, and his belief that the disparity was due in part to the

fact that Liberty QVCA common stock is a tracking stock and not included in stock indices, and that the market viewed HSNi as a potential takeover target. Mr. Maffei suggested
to the representative of Goldman Sachs that they combine the two companies at fair value in a transaction that would compensate the HSNi stockholders for roughly half of the
estimated $750 million of net present value of synergies, net of transaction fees, that Liberty Interactive expected to be realized as a result of a potential combination of Liberty
Interactive and HSNi, which was equal to approximately $100 million of annual synergies capitalized at a multiple of 8x, net of an estimated $50 million in transaction fees.
Mr. Maffei indicated that Liberty Interactive was exploring ways to announce a deal that would create an asset-based stock consisting of QVC and zulily and Liberty Interactive's
stake in HSNi. The representative of Goldman Sachs conveyed this information to the Special Committee later that day.

        On March 10, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic discussion that included representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs. The Special
Committee discussed with representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs the contours of the potential transaction discussed with Mr. Maffei. Following
discussion, the Special Committee directed HSNi management to further refine their analysis of the potential synergies that could be generated by a combination of Liberty
Interactive and HSNi.

        On March 15, 2017, the Liberty Interactive board held a meeting at which representatives of Liberty Interactive management informed the Liberty Interactive board that
there were preliminary discussions occurring with HSNi regarding a potential transaction.

        On March 28, 2017, Mr. Maffei called representatives of Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs to inform them that Liberty Interactive expected to announce a transaction
in the next two weeks that would separate its QVC Group and Ventures Group assets and liabilities into separate companies, each with asset-based stocks.

        On March 29, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic discussion that included representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs. The
representatives of Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners provided an update regarding their March 28, 2017 call with Mr. Maffei, and advised the Special Committee that they
expected Mr. Maffei to make a proposal regarding a transaction with HSNi after the market had an opportunity to incorporate the impact of the announcement of the proposed
transaction referred to by Mr. Maffei in their March 28, 2017 call.

        On April 4, 2017, Liberty Interactive announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire GCI in a transaction expected to result in certain Ventures Group assets and
liabilities being split off from Liberty Interactive, leaving behind the QVC Group assets and liabilities. Liberty Interactive entered into the GCI reorganization agreement
independent and irrespective of the ongoing discussions with HSNi. Accordingly, the closing of the GCI transactions was not conditioned upon the closing of a potential
transaction with HSNi nor was a potential transaction with HSNi to be conditioned upon the closing of the GCI transactions. Liberty Interactive intended to close each of the GCI
transactions and a potential transaction with HSNi as soon as reasonably practicable in no specific order.

        On April 17, 2017, representatives of Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners called Mr. Maffei to discuss the timing of a potential strategic combination. The
representatives of Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs informed Mr. Maffei that this process had been consuming a significant amount of HSNi management's time and the
Special Committee wanted to either proceed expeditiously with discussions regarding a potential combination of HSNi and Liberty Interactive or abandon discussions and focus
on executing HSNi's stand-alone plan. Mr. Maffei indicated that Liberty Interactive intended to wait until after the release of Liberty Interactive's first quarter earnings on May 9,
2017 before discussing further.

        On April 21, 2017, Ms. Mindy Grossman, Chief Executive Officer of HSNi and a member of the HSNi board, delivered to the HSNi board her written resignation from
HSNi, including in her capacity

as a director and officer of HSNi. The HSNi board accepted Ms. Grossman's resignation effective May 24, 2017.

        On April 24, 2017, the HSNi board established, on an interim basis, an Office of the Chief Executive, which included Mr. Little, Mr. William C. Brand, President of HSN
and Chief Marketing Officer of HSNi, and Ms. Judy Schmeling, President of Cornerstone Brands and Chief Operating Officer of HSNi, with Mr. Little acting as HSNi's interim
principal executive officer.

        On May 10, 2017, Liberty Interactive confidentially provided the HSNi board with a preliminary, non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of HSNi's stock for $40.50 per
share payable in shares of Liberty QVCA common stock in an all-stock transaction (representing a premium of approximately 9.5% to HSNi's closing price as of May 10, 2017),
which proposal also indicated that HSNi would be entitled to designate appropriate board representation in connection with the completion of any such transaction, and that the
proposed merger consideration included therein was subject to a number of contingencies, including the completion of due diligence and execution of definitive agreements.

        On May 11, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting regarding the proposal received from Liberty Interactive. Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview
Partners and Goldman Sachs participated in the meeting. The Special Committee discussed the terms of Liberty Interactive's May 10 proposal, including the manner in which
synergies would be shared by the HSNi stockholders and the floating exchange ratio included in the proposal. Representatives of the financial advisors provided their initial
analysis of the proposal, including a summary of Liberty Interactive's previously announced transaction with GCI, in addition to a review of both HSNi and the QVC Group's
recent earnings reports. The Special Committee noted that the proposal was not conditioned on the completion of the transaction with GCI. The Special Committee discussed the
importance of closing certainty in light of the recently announced departure of Ms. Grossman. The Special Committee agreed to reconvene on May 15, 2017, to discuss the
proposal in greater detail after Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs had an opportunity to complete their analysis.

        On May 15, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting regarding the proposal received from Liberty Interactive. Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview
Partners and Goldman Sachs participated in the meeting. The Special Committee reviewed various components of Liberty Interactive's May 10 proposal and Centerview Partners'
and Goldman Sachs's analyses. Representatives of the financial advisors reviewed their updated financial analyses of HSNi and the potential combination, along with
recommendations for the Special Committee regarding the optimal response to Liberty Interactive in order to maximize HSNi stockholder value. The Special Committee then
discussed the proposed timeline and sequencing for the due diligence requested by Liberty Interactive. The Special Committee discussed the merits of conditioning a transaction
with Liberty Interactive on the consummation of Liberty Interactive's proposed transaction with GCI, but concluded that such a condition was not in the best interests of the
HSNi stockholders. The Special Committee discussed the likelihood that a transaction with Liberty Interactive would maximize HSNi stockholder value even if the GCI
transactions were not ultimately consummated. In addition, the Special Committee determined that conditioning the transaction with Liberty Interactive on the closing of the GCI
transactions would introduce significant closing uncertainty for HSNi stockholders and was unlikely to be acceptable to Liberty Interactive. Following discussions, the Special
Committee directed representatives of the financial advisors to contact Liberty Interactive to discuss the assumptions underlying the proposal and the Special Committee's belief
that the transaction should be based on a fixed exchange ratio so that the HSNi stockholders would be able to participate in any increase in the Liberty QVCA common stock
price attributable to the combination. Representatives of Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs delivered this message to Mr. Maffei on May 16, 2017.

        On May 18, 2017, Liberty Interactive confidentially provided HSNi with a revised preliminary, non-binding proposal to acquire 100% of HSNi in an all-stock transaction
for a fixed exchange ratio of

1.735 shares of Liberty QVCA common stock per share of HSNi common stock (representing a premium of approximately 20% to the closing price of HSNi common stock as of
May 18, 2017). The proposal indicated that it was subject to a number of contingencies, including HSNi generating financial results not below that of current Wall Street
consensus estimates for revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (which is sometimes referred to herein as EBITDA) for the second quarter of
2017, as well as the satisfactory completion of business, legal, tax and accounting diligence.

        On May 19, 2017, members of the Special Committee held an update call with representatives from Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs regarding Liberty Interactive's
May 18 proposal. Representatives of the financial advisors reviewed the changes reflected in Liberty Interactive's May 18 proposal, including the fixed (rather than floating)
exchange ratio, as well as HSNi management's earnings expectations for the second quarter of 2017 relative to the current Wall Street consensus estimates. Representatives of the
financial advisors advised the Special Committee that they believed Liberty Interactive would be able to further increase the exchange ratio.

        On May 23, 2017, the Liberty Interactive board held a meeting regarding the current status of negotiations with HSNi. Senior management of Liberty Interactive attended
the meeting.

        On May 24, 2017, the HSNi board held its regular quarterly meeting. Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners, Goldman Sachs and members of HSNi
management joined for a portion of the meeting in order to update the members of the HSNi board on the terms of Liberty Interactive's May 10 and May 18 proposals and the
discussions they had with Mr. Maffei regarding these proposals. Ms. Chun and Mr. Costello recused themselves from this portion of the meeting. The HSNi board discussed the
contingency included in the May 18 proposal regarding HSNi's second quarter results and the market's likely reaction to the proposal and HSNi's alternatives if it were to reject
Liberty Interactive's proposal. Representatives of the financial advisors also informed the Qualified Directors that Liberty Interactive had made clear that it was not interested in
selling its approximately 38.2% ownership position in HSNi or supporting any such alternative transaction. Representatives of the financial advisors then reviewed HSNi's stand-
alone plan, noting the challenging landscape for HSNi relative to QVC and the retail industry as a whole. Representatives of the financial advisors updated the Qualified
Directors on their preliminary financial analysis of HSNi and a potential combination. The Qualified Directors discussed the risks inherent in HSNi's stand-alone plan, including
the fact that HSNi was operating without a CEO and that QVC had been performing better relative to HSNi. Representatives of Davis Polk then reviewed with the Qualified
Directors their fiduciary duties in connection with their consideration of the proposal.

        The Qualified Directors also discussed the possibility, and risks, of conducting a broad sale process pre-signing in light of Liberty Interactive's unwillingness to sell its HSNi
shares or support an alternative transaction, and representatives of the financial advisors advised that outreach to other potential buyers would likely be futile in those
circumstances. Members of HSNi management were then excused from the meeting and the Qualified Directors and representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and
Goldman Sachs continued to discuss Liberty Interactive's proposals and the Special Committee's optimal response. Representatives of the financial advisors stated that they
believed there might be additional value that Liberty Interactive would be willing to offer, but that in their view Liberty Interactive was likely nearing its maximum offer price.
Additionally, representatives of the financial advisors noted that Liberty Interactive would be aware before signing that HSNi was unlikely to meet Wall Street consensus
estimates, as required by Liberty Interactive's May 18 proposal, as a result of normal due diligence. Representatives of Davis Polk reviewed the key contractual terms for the
Qualified Directors to consider in the context of any eventual merger agreement, including the possibility of conditioning the transaction on the approval by a majority of HSNi's
non-Liberty Interactive stockholders. The Qualified Directors also discussed the possibility that rejecting Liberty Interactive's May 18 proposal would cause Liberty Interactive to
terminate discussions with HSNi

regarding the potential transaction. Following discussion, the Special Committee instructed representatives of Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs to inform Mr. Maffei that
HSNi was reviewing Liberty Interactive's latest proposal and planned to respond the following day.

        On May 25, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting to further discuss Liberty Interactive's May 18 proposal and to formulate an appropriate response.
Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs participated in the meeting. The Special Committee discussed various aspects of the response and
determined that it was advisable and in the best interests of the HSNi stockholders to propose a fixed exchange ratio of 1.790 shares of Liberty QVCA common stock for each
share of HSNi common stock, which was in line with the six-month average exchange ratio between Liberty QVCA common stock and HSNi common stock-based on market
prices and a premium of approximately 21% to the closing price of HSNi common stock as of May 25, 2017, and to make clear that HSNi expected to continue paying its regular,
quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share during the period between signing of any merger agreement and the closing of the transaction. The Special Committee determined that
the response should emphasize the importance of negotiating and executing definitive documentation on an expedited basis and ensuring that, once announced, Liberty
Interactive's ability to abandon the transaction is limited, and accordingly, that the contingency relating to HSNi's second quarter performance should be removed. The Special
Committee determined that Mr. Martinez would contact Mr. Maffei to convey the Special Committee's response regarding the principal economic points and representatives of
the financial advisors would follow-up with the Special Committee's response on the other material terms and conditions.

        Later on May 25, 2017, Mr. Martinez called Mr. Maffei to respond to Liberty Interactive's May 18 proposal as directed by the Special Committee. Mr. Maffei informed
Mr. Martinez that he was not inclined to increase the exchange ratio but would consider these points and discuss further.

        On May 26, 2017, Mr. Maffei called a representative of Goldman Sachs to request support for HSNi's assertion that an exchange ratio of 1.790 shares of Liberty QVCA
common stock for each share of HSNi common stock better reflected an approximate 50/50 sharing of the expected synergies, as compared to Liberty Interactive's proposed
exchange ratio of 1.735.

        Later on May 26, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs participated in the
meeting. Mr. Martinez updated the Special Committee regarding his May 25, 2017 discussion with Mr. Maffei. Representatives of the financial advisors reviewed HSNi
management's estimates of potential cost and revenue synergies that might result from a transaction and described to the Special Committee Mr. Maffei's call to a representative
of Goldman Sachs earlier that day and Mr. Maffei's request for HSNi's synergy analysis. Following discussion, the Special Committee determined that it was advisable and in the
best interests of the HSNi stockholders to share its synergy analysis if Liberty Interactive agreed to provide its own and to keep the information confidential subject to a
customary confidentiality agreement to be negotiated by HSNi and Liberty Interactive in due course.

        Also on May 26, 2017, following receipt of confirmation from representatives of Liberty Interactive that Liberty Interactive would provide its own synergy analysis and
would keep HSNi's analysis confidential, HSNi sent Liberty Interactive its synergy analysis.

        On May 30, 2017, Liberty Interactive sent the Special Committee its synergy analysis.

        On May 31, 2017, members of the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting with representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs as well as
Mr. Little and Mr. Michael J. Attinella, Chief Accounting Officer of HSNi, to review the synergy analysis provided by Liberty Interactive on May 30, 2017.

        Later on May 31, 2017, members of HSNi management, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs held a conference call with representatives of Liberty Interactive,
including representatives of QVC, to review each party's analysis of the potential synergies resulting from the proposed transaction.

        On June 1, 2017, Liberty Interactive informed representatives of Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs that Liberty Interactive may be willing increase the fixed
exchange ratio to 1.750 shares of Liberty QVCA common stock per share of HSNi common stock (representing a premium of approximately 27% to the closing price of HSNi
common stock as of June 1, 2017), subject to the same contingencies discussed in its earlier non-binding proposals).

        On June 2, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting regarding the June 1, 2017 non-binding proposal received from Liberty Interactive. Representatives of
Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs participated in the meeting. The advisors and the Special Committee discussed various components of the proposal and
representatives of Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs advised the Special Committee that they believed that it was unlikely Liberty Interactive would agree to any further
increase to the exchange ratio. Mr. Martinez informed the Special Committee that, earlier that day, Mr. Little had informed him that he expected HSNi's second quarter revenue to
be below current Wall Street consensus estimates. Following discussion, the Special Committee determined that it was advisable and in the best interests of the HSNi
stockholders to continue negotiating with Liberty Interactive on the basis of a 1.750 exchange ratio, subject to Liberty Interactive agreeing to permit HSNi to continue paying its
regular quarterly cash dividend and to certain other terms intended to provide increased closing certainty. The Special Committee directed representatives of the financial
advisors to deliver their response to Liberty Interactive and to inform Liberty Interactive that the Special Committee was prepared to recommend that the HSNi board approve the
proposal subject to these other terms. The Special Committee also directed representatives of the financial advisors to arrange a call between HSNi and Liberty Interactive
regarding the companies' second quarter performance, which would occur prior to any further information regarding HSNi being provided, so that Liberty Interactive could
confirm their proposal in light of that information. The Special Committee also directed representatives of Davis Polk to send a confidentiality agreement to Liberty Interactive's
counsel. The Special Committee then discussed whether Liberty Interactive should be required to agree to a standstill provision in the confidentiality agreement. Following
discussion, the Special Committee determined that a standstill provision was not necessary in this context due to Liberty Interactive's approximately 38.2% interest in HSNi, the
existing restrictions on Liberty Interactive acquiring additional shares of HSNi common stock under the terms of the Spinco Agreement between HSNi and Liberty Interactive
(which is described in more detail in the section entitled "—Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Relationship Between HSNi and Liberty Interactive—Spinco
Agreement") and the likelihood that requesting a standstill provision could lead to Liberty Interactive withdrawing its proposal and terminating discussions.

        Also on June 2, 2017, Davis Polk sent a draft mutual confidentiality agreement to Baker Botts L.L.P. (Baker Botts), legal counsel to Liberty Interactive. On June 4 and
June 5, 2017, Baker Botts and Davis Polk exchanged revised drafts of the confidentiality agreement.

        On June 5, 2017, Liberty Interactive and HSNi executed the confidentiality agreement.

        On June 6, 2017, Mr. Maffei called a representative of Goldman Sachs to coordinate the process for HSNi and Liberty Interactive to conduct due diligence on one another.

        On June 8, 2017, members of HSNi management, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs held a conference call with representatives of Liberty Interactive to review
HSNi's results for the month of April, draft results for the month of May and expected results for the month of June as well as the expected consolidated results for the second
quarter of fiscal year 2017. Mr. Little also spoke about the observed industry trends impacting the business.

        Also on June 8, 2017, representatives of Liberty Interactive, including QVC, held a telephonic meeting with representatives of HSNi and the financial advisors to review
HSNi's second quarter outlook.

        On June 9, 2017, Mr. Maffei called a representative of Goldman Sachs to inform him that, due to the deterioration in HSNi's business reflected in its second quarter revenue
estimates, Liberty Interactive was reducing its proposed exchange ratio to 1.600 shares of Liberty QVCA common stock per share of HSNi common stock (representing a
premium of approximately 18% to the closing price of HSNi common stock as of June 9, 2017), and that its current proposal otherwise remained subject to the same
contingencies discussed in its earlier proposals. The representative of Goldman Sachs informed the Special Committee of the proposed reduction in the exchange ratio.

        On June 12, 2017, Mr. Maffei contacted a representative of Goldman Sachs for an update on HSNi's review of the proposed transaction. The representative of Goldman
Sachs informed Mr. Maffei that he did not have a formal response yet from the Special Committee, but the reduced price had not been well received by members of the Special
Committee. Mr. Maffei informed the representative of Goldman Sachs that Liberty Interactive was willing to delay the transaction until after second quarter earnings were
announced.

        Also on June 12, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting with representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs to discuss the
proposed reduction in the exchange ratio. A representative of Goldman Sachs relayed to the Special Committee his earlier discussion with Mr. Maffei, including Mr. Maffei's
suggestion that they delay future discussion until after second quarter earnings were announced. Mr. Little then reviewed with the Special Committee HSNi's current outlook for
the second quarter and the next 18 months. The Special Committee then discussed the comparative challenges facing the HSNi business and the QVC business. The Special
Committee agreed to reconvene after it had a chance to review the forthcoming draft of the merger agreement in order to discuss the appropriate response.

        Later on June 12, 2017, Baker Botts delivered to Davis Polk an initial draft of the merger agreement.

        On June 13, 2017, Mr. Maffei called a representative of Goldman Sachs to discuss the initial draft of the merger agreement. The representative of Goldman Sachs informed
Mr. Maffei that the draft omitted certain significant considerations that were important to the Special Committee, including the ability for HSNi to continue paying its regular
quarterly cash dividend of up to $0.35 per share, a requirement that the transaction be conditioned on approval by a majority of HSNi's non-Liberty Interactive stockholders and a
meaningful undertaking on Liberty Interactive's part to take the actions necessary to obtain regulatory approval. Mr. Maffei agreed that HSNi would be permitted to continue
paying its regular quarterly dividend of up to $0.35 per share of HSNi common stock and to provide HSNi reasonable flexibility to hire and retain personnel during the period
between signing and closing. He also informed the representative of Goldman Sachs that Liberty Interactive was not willing to agree to specific undertakings in order to obtain
regulatory approval, that Liberty Interactive was unwilling to condition the transaction on the approval of a majority of the non-Liberty Interactive stockholders and that it was
important to Liberty Interactive that HSNi not be permitted to terminate the agreement in order to enter into an agreement with a third party providing for a superior proposal
unless and until HSNi stockholders voted against the proposed transaction.

        Also on June 13, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting regarding Liberty Interactive's latest June 9, 2017 proposal regarding the reduced exchange ratio.
Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs participated in the meeting. Representatives of Davis Polk reviewed with the Special Committee the key
provisions and principal issues raised by Liberty Interactive's initial draft of the merger agreement. A representative of Goldman Sachs then relayed to the Special Committee his
earlier discussion with Mr. Maffei regarding certain of those

provisions. The Special Committee discussed the proposal and the value it offered the HSNi stockholders compared to the value the HSNi stockholders would receive if HSNi
remained a stand-alone company, as well as the availability of other strategic alternatives, taking into account Liberty Interactive's previously stated position that it would not be
interested in selling its approximately 38.2% stake or supporting an alternative transaction. Following discussion, the Special Committee determined that it was advisable and in
the best interests of the HSNi stockholders to propose a fixed exchange ratio of 1.700 shares of Liberty QVCA common stock per share of HSNi common stock (representing a
premium of approximately 28% to the closing price of HSNi common stock as of June 13, 2017). The Special Committee directed representatives of the financial advisors to
deliver their response to Liberty Interactive and to inform Liberty Interactive that the Special Committee was prepared to recommend that HSNi's board approve the proposal at
that price subject to certain other conditions, including an expedited timeline to signing.

        On June 14, 2017, a representative of Goldman Sachs delivered to Mr. Maffei the Special Committee's response. Mr. Maffei informed the representative of Goldman Sachs
that Liberty Interactive may be willing to increase the exchange ratio to 1.650 shares of Liberty QVCA common stock per share of HSNi common stock and expected to be in a
position to execute the definitive agreement within two weeks (subject to the completion of ongoing due diligence, among other contingencies), but Liberty Interactive was not
willing to condition the transaction on the approval of the non-Liberty Interactive shareholders.

        On June 15, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting with representatives of Davis Polk, Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners. A representative of
Goldman Sachs informed the Special Committee that he had relayed the Special Committee's response to Mr. Maffei as well as Mr. Maffei's latest proposal that was discussed the
previous evening. In response, representatives of Goldman Sachs said that Liberty Interactive may be willing to increase the exchange ratio to 1.650 shares of Liberty QVCA
common stock per share of HSNi common stock (representing a premium of approximately 25% to the closing price of HSNi common stock as of June 14, 2017), and expected
to be in a position to execute the definitive agreement within two weeks, but Liberty Interactive was not willing to condition the transaction on the approval of a majority of the
non-Liberty Interactive HSNi stockholders and that the increased exchange ratio remained subject to certain contingencies, including ongoing due diligence. Representatives of
Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs advised the Special Committee that in their view, Liberty Interactive was unlikely to further increase the exchange ratio. Representatives
of Davis Polk reviewed with the Special Committee various issues relating to removing the condition that the transaction be approved by a majority of HSNi's non-Liberty
Interactive stockholders. Following discussion, the Special Committee agreed to proceed without that condition.

        On June 16, 2017, HSNi provided access to a virtual dataroom to Liberty Interactive and its advisors, in response to diligence requests previously sent by Liberty Interactive
and its advisors. From June 16, 2017, and on a continuing basis up until the date the merger agreement was executed, both Liberty Interactive and HSNi, along with their
respective advisors, conducted business, legal and financial due diligence regarding their respective business operations, including engaging in due diligence calls and meetings
on various topics.

        Also on June 16, 2017, Davis Polk delivered to Baker Botts a revised draft of the merger agreement. From June 16, 2017 until the execution of the merger agreement on
July 5, 2017, the parties and their respective legal and financial advisors exchanged numerous drafts of, and engaged in numerous discussions and negotiations concerning the
terms of, the merger agreement and related disclosure schedules and exhibits. Significant areas of discussion and negotiation included Liberty Interactive's obligation to take
meaningful action as might be necessary to obtain the required regulatory approvals and the associated reverse termination fee payable by Liberty Interactive in the event the
transaction did not close due to the failure to obtain any of the required regulatory approvals, HSNi's obligation to cooperate with Liberty Interactive's financing activities and the

associated condition to closing relating to Liberty Interactive's financing, the "no-shop" provisions and the circumstances in which (i) either party would be permitted to terminate
the merger agreement in response to the HSNi board changing its recommendation with respect to the transaction, (ii) HSNi would be permitted to terminate the merger
agreement in order to enter into an agreement with a third party and (iii) a fee would be payable by HSNi in connection therewith, and various employee-related matters.
Documentary and other due diligence by both parties also continued in parallel with the negotiation of the merger agreement and the overall transaction.

        On June 20, 2017 and June 21, 2017, representatives of the financial advisors met with representatives of HSNi and Liberty Interactive, including QVC, to discuss the
proposed transaction and conduct due diligence, including on the potential synergies that could result from a potential transaction. Representatives of Liberty Interactive also
discussed the QVC Group's expected results for the second quarter of 2017 and provided their updated outlook for full fiscal years 2017 and 2018.

        Also on June 21, 2017, Liberty Interactive formally engaged Allen & Company LLC (Allen & Co.) to act as its financial advisor with respect to the potential transaction
with HSNi. From time to time during the negotiations described above and below (including prior to their official engagement), representatives of Allen & Co. provided strategic
advice to senior management of Liberty Interactive with respect to the potential transaction with HSNi. However, neither Allen & Co. nor any other outside third party was asked
to provide, or did provide, a fairness opinion, report or appraisal to Liberty Interactive or any of its affiliates (other than HSNi to the extent it is deemed an affiliate of Liberty
Interactive) regarding the transaction. All opinions, reports and appraisals regarding the potential transaction presented to, and relied on by, the Liberty Interactive board were
prepared and presented by management of Liberty Interactive.

        On June 22, 2017, the Qualified Directors held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs as well as Mr. Little
participated in the meeting. Mr. Little reviewed HSNi management's financial outlook for the second quarter of 2017 as well as its updated outlook for the full fiscal year 2017.
Representatives of the financial advisors then provided a review of Liberty Interactive's latest proposal and an update on the process and the diligence meetings that were held on
June 20, 2017. Representatives of Davis Polk reviewed with the Qualified Directors key terms and principal issues raised by the latest draft of the merger agreement.

        On June 23, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs participated in the meeting.
The advisors and the Special Committee discussed various topics from the Qualified Directors meeting that occurred the prior day, along with next steps regarding the proposed
transaction. The Special Committee discussed the potential antitrust implications for the proposed transaction and various methods of incentivizing Liberty Interactive to take
appropriate action in order to obtain the required regulatory approvals and to compensate the HSNi stockholders in the event any of the regulatory approvals are not obtained.
The Special Committee also discussed alternative structural considerations for the proposed transaction, including whether to structure the transaction as one-step merger or a
tender offer followed by a short-form merger. Given that representatives of Liberty Interactive had indicated a strong preference for a one-step merger, and the low likelihood that
a two-step transaction would materially accelerate the closing, the Special Committee determined to proceed with a one-step transaction structure. Representatives of the
financial advisors analyzed and discussed with the Special Committee various other structural considerations, including the possibility of waiting until the GCI transactions had
closed. For various reasons, including the risks and uncertainties associated with alternative transaction structures and with delaying the transaction, the Special Committee
determined that such alternative transaction structures were unlikely to prove significantly more advantageous to the HSNi stockholders. The Special Committee also discussed
the conditions to closing of the transaction. The Special Committee directed representatives of Davis Polk on how to respond to these issues and the other material terms, and to
revise the merger agreement accordingly. The Special Committee directed

representatives of the financial advisors to arrange a call with Mr. Maffei after representatives of Davis Polk delivered a revised draft of the merger agreement to Baker Botts in
order to discuss the timeline and process for due diligence, particularly in light of the amount of information that had been requested by Liberty Interactive and the resources
HSNi was expending to satisfy those requests.

        Also on June 23, 2017, Liberty Interactive provided access to a virtual dataroom to HSNi and its advisors, in response to diligence requests previously sent by HSNi and its
advisors.

        On June 26, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs participated in the meeting.
Representatives of the financial advisors informed the Special Committee that Mr. Maffei indicated that further progress needed to be made with regard to certain due diligence
items and certain provisions of the merger agreement before a final agreement could be reached. Mr. Little reviewed with the Special Committee the unaudited forecasted
financial information prepared by QVC management and HSNi management's proposed adjustments to that unaudited forecasted financial information. Following discussion, the
Special Committee determined that the unaudited forecasted financial information, as adjusted by HSNi management, was fair and based on reasonable assumptions, and
approved it for use by the financial advisors in connection with their analyses.

        On June 28, 2017, Mr. Maffei called a representative of Goldman Sachs to discuss the remaining open items in the merger agreement and the due diligence process.
Mr. Maffei indicated to the representative of Goldman Sachs that Liberty Interactive believed it was reasonable to target a public announcement of a potential transaction on
July 6, 2017, subject to the satisfactory resolution of the outstanding material issues and completion of due diligence.

        Also on June 28, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs participated in the
meeting. At the Special Committee's request, representatives of Davis Polk reviewed with the Special Committee the material open issues in the merger agreement, including
HSNi's right to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an agreement with a third party providing for a superior transaction proposal (as defined in the "—The
Merger Agreement—No Solicitation" section) subject to payment of a customary termination fee, the inclusion of a closing condition relating to Liberty Interactive's financing
and certain employee-related matters. Representatives of Davis Polk informed the Special Committee that Liberty Interactive had agreed to the inclusion of a reverse termination
break-up fee in the event the transaction did not close due to the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals but that the amount of the fee was still subject to negotiation.

        On June 29, 2017, representatives of Liberty Interactive, including QVC, and HSNi as well as representatives of the financial advisors held a series of in-person due
diligence meetings in Tampa, Florida.

        On June 30, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs participated in the meeting.
Representatives of Davis Polk reviewed with the Special Committee the material open issues in the merger agreement. Following discussion, the Special Committee directed
representatives of Davis Polk on how to respond to these issues and the other material terms, and to revise the merger agreement accordingly.

        On July 2, 2017, representatives of Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs spoke with Mr. Maffei regarding the remaining open issues in the merger agreement.
Mr. Maffei agreed to allow HSNi to terminate the merger agreement in order to enter into an agreement with a third party providing for a superior transaction proposal, subject to
payment of a $40 million termination fee. Mr. Maffei and the representatives of Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs discussed certain employee related matters, including
HSNi's ability to continue the search for a new CEO and the treatment of outstanding equity awards with respect to shares of HSNi common stock. Mr. Maffei also agreed that
HSNi would have a

consent right with respect to certain material changes to Liberty Interactive's proposed transaction with GCI, subject to continuing discussion regarding the appropriate
parameters of such consent right.

        On July 4, 2017, Mr. Little requested the Special Committee's approval of the unaudited forecasted financial information for HSNi on a stand-alone basis, the unaudited
forecasted financial information for the QVC Group on a stand-alone basis prepared by the management of HSNi (based on forecasts that were initially prepared by the
management of Liberty Interactive) and the unaudited forecasted financial information for the QVC Group pro forma for the merger prepared by the management of HSNi.
Mr. Little noted that the financial information for HSNi stand-alone upon which the unaudited forecasted financial information for HSNi stand-alone and the QVC Group pro
forma for the merger was based reflected the updated outlook for the fiscal year ending 2017, as discussed with the Qualified Directors on June 22, 2017, and, for the fiscal years
ending 2018 through 2021, reflected the projections previously approved by the Special Committee on January 30, 2017. The Special Committee determined that the unaudited
forecasted financial information for HSNi stand-alone and for the QVC Group pro forma for the merger were fair and based on reasonable assumptions, and approved them for
use by the financial advisors in connection with their analyses.

        Also on July 4, 2017, the Special Committee held a telephonic meeting. Representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs participated in the meeting.
Representatives of Davis Polk discussed certain unresolved issues in connection with the merger agreement. The Special Committee concluded that a $75 million reverse
termination break-up fee was sufficient to incentivize Liberty Interactive to take appropriate actions to obtain the required regulatory approvals. Following discussion, the Special
Committee directed representatives of Davis Polk on how to respond to these issues and the other material terms.

        On July 5, 2017, after the markets were closed, the Special Committee and other Qualified Directors held a meeting for the purpose of considering the proposed transaction
with Liberty Interactive, with representatives of Davis Polk, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs in attendance at the meeting. Mr. Martinez reviewed with the Qualified
Directors the proposal from Liberty Interactive to acquire HSNi for a fixed exchange ratio of 1.650 shares of Liberty QVCA common stock per share of HSNi common stock.
Mr. Martinez informed the Qualified Directors that the remaining issues were being discussed between Davis Polk and Baker Botts with the intention to have them resolved in
the next few hours. Without representatives of Centerview Partners or Goldman Sachs present, the Qualified Directors and representatives of Davis Polk discussed the fiduciary
duties of the Qualified Directors in connection with the proposed transaction. The Special Committee then reviewed the updated relationship disclosures provided by each
financial advisor to supplement the questionnaires provided to the Special Committee prior to its January 5, 2017 meeting, and reflecting matters arising since that time. The
Special Committee determined that it did not believe that either Centerview Partners or Goldman Sachs had any actual or potential conflict of interest that would impair either
firm's ability to provide independent advice to the Qualified Directors and the Special Committee. Thereafter, at the request of the Special Committee, Centerview Partners and
Goldman Sachs joined the meeting and delivered a presentation to the Special Committee and the other Qualified Directors with respect to the financial terms of the proposed
transaction with Liberty Interactive. Representatives of the financial advisors and the Qualified Directors had a detailed discussion of the unaudited forecasted financial
information for QVC prepared by the management of HSNi (based on forecasts that were initially prepared by the management of Liberty Interactive), and the unaudited
forecasted financial information for HSNi prepared by HSNi management, used for the financial analyses. Representatives of the financial advisors and the Qualified Directors
discussed the potential benefits associated with the Liberty QVCA common stock included in the merger consideration becoming an asset-based (as opposed to tracking) stock in
the event that the GCI transactions were consummated, including the potential eligibility of such stock for inclusion in stock indices, which may increase liquidity, the direct
claim that holders of such stock would have on QVC's

assets and QVC's greater flexibility for future strategic actions. Representatives of the financial advisors noted that the failure of the GCI transactions to close would likely
reverse any increase in the price of the Liberty QVCA common stock resulting from the announcement of the GCI transactions. Representatives of the financial advisors also
noted that regardless of whether the Liberty QVCA common stock were a tracking stock or an asset-based stock, each share would only be entitled to one vote as compared to 10
votes per share of QVCB. Representatives of the financial advisors then reviewed their separate financial analyses of Liberty Interactive's proposal to acquire HSNi for 1.650
shares of Liberty QVCA common stock per share of HSNi common stock (representing a premium of approximately 29% to the closing price of HSNi common stock as of
July 5, 2017). Centerview Partners rendered to the Special Committee (with the other Qualified Directors present) an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery
of a written opinion dated July 5, 2017, that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications
and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview Partners in preparing its opinion, the consideration to be paid by Liberty Interactive to the holders of shares of HSNi
common stock (other than as specified in such opinion) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. For a detailed discussion of
Centerview Partners' opinion, please see "—Opinion of the Special Committee Financial Advisors (Centerview Partners)." Goldman Sachs rendered to the Special Committee
(with the other Qualified Directors present) an oral opinion, which was subsequently confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated July 5, 2017, that, as of such date and
based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein the consideration to be paid by Liberty Interactive for each share of HSNi common stock pursuant to the
merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders (other than the Liberty Interactive related entities) of shares of HSNi common stock. For a detailed
discussion of Goldman Sachs' opinion, please see "—Opinion of the Special Committee Financial Advisors (Goldman Sachs)." Also at the July 5, 2017 meeting, representatives
of Davis Polk provided the Special Committee and the other Qualified Directors with a summary of the key terms in the merger agreement. The Special Committee and the other
Qualified Directors adjourned the meeting and reconvened later that night, at which time representatives of Davis Polk informed the Special Committee and the other Qualified
Directors that HSNi and Liberty Interactive had agreed to mutually acceptable resolutions regarding the remaining material issues. Representatives of Goldman Sachs and
Centerview Partners informed the Special Committee and the other Qualified Directors that, in order to resolve certain concerns raised by Liberty Interactive about the aggregate
transaction fees payable to Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners by HSNi under their respective engagement letters in light of Liberty Interactive's existing significant equity
interest in HSNi, Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners had orally advised Liberty Interactive that, to the extent they were engaged in the future to provide investment banking
advisory services to Liberty Interactive or certain entities controlled by Liberty Interactive, each would provide, depending on the circumstances, a credit toward such
engagement. After discussion, the Special Committee and the other Qualified Directors determined that all open material issues had been resolved in a manner satisfactory to the
Special Committee and the other Qualified Directors and in the best interests of the HSNi stockholders. The Special Committee unanimously recommended that the Qualified
Directors (i) determine the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, HSNi and the
HSNi stockholders, (ii) approve and declare advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger and (iii) direct that the merger
agreement be submitted to the HSNi stockholders for adoption. On the recommendation of the Special Committee, the Qualified Directors (i) determined the merger agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, HSNi and the HSNi stockholders, (ii) approved and
declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, (iii) resolved to recommend that the HSNi stockholders approve the
adoption of the merger agreement and (iv) directed that the merger agreement be submitted to the HSNi stockholders for adoption. The Qualified Directors also approved a one-
time payment of $50,000 to

each member of the Special Committee (other than Mr. Martinez, who at the time the Special Committee was formed declined to receive any payment), and agreed to reimburse
the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of each member of the Special Committee in connection with each member's service on the Special Committee.

        Also on July 5, 2017, the Liberty Interactive board held a telephonic meeting to discuss and review the terms of the transaction. Representatives of Baker Botts and senior
management of Liberty Interactive participated in a discussion with the Liberty Interactive board regarding the transaction, including the proposal exchange ratio. While the
Liberty Interactive board acknowledged the potential appreciation in value of the Liberty QVCA common stock following the merger and the closing of the GCI transactions,
after which the Liberty QVCA common stock would become an asset-based stock as opposed to a tracking stock, any potential appreciation in value was not quantified in its
consideration of the terms of the potential transaction. Following such discussion, the Liberty Interactive board unanimously (i) determined that the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, Liberty Interactive and its stockholders, and (ii) approved and
declared advisable the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger.

        The merger agreement was executed and delivered, as of July 5, 2017, by Liberty Interactive, Merger Sub and HSNi.

        On July 6, 2017, before the markets opened, Liberty Interactive and HSNi announced that they had entered into the merger agreement.

Liberty Interactive's Purpose and Reasons for the Merger

        The Liberty Interactive board has determined that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable and in the best
interests of Liberty Interactive and its stockholders. In reaching this conclusion, the Liberty Interactive board consulted with Liberty Interactive's management and its legal and
financial advisors, and considered a variety of factors, including the material factors described below.

Liberty Interactive's Reasons for the Merger

        In reaching its conclusion that the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger, are advisable and in the best interest of Liberty
Interactive and its stockholders, the Liberty Interactive board considered a number of factors that it believes support its determination, including (not necessarily in order of
importance):

• the expectation that the merger will enhance the long-term equity value for stockholders of the QVC Group; 

• the belief that the integration of HSNi can be completed in a timely and efficient manner with minimal disruption to employees; 

• the experience of Liberty Interactive's management team in maximizing the value proposition of its investments; 

• the in-depth knowledge of HSNi's business, operations, financial condition and prospects developed by Liberty Interactive as an equity affiliate of HSNi and
during additional significant due diligence efforts; 

• the current and prospective business climate in which HSNi operates and will continue to operate following the completion of the merger;

• the likelihood that the merger will be completed, including after consideration of, among other things, (i) antitrust and regulatory laws and the risks related to
certain conditions and requirements that may be imposed by third parties, including regulatory authorities, to obtain the necessary approvals and clearances, and
(ii) the likelihood of HSNi obtaining the required stockholder approval following Liberty Interactive's agreement to vote its shares of HSNi common stock in
favor of the merger agreement proposal and in favor of any other matter necessary to consummate the merger; 

• the opportunity to improve the competitive position of the QVC Group relative to other participants in the industry in which QVC and HSNi operate; 

• the opportunity to acquire HSNi's programming and events and leading brands; 

• the belief that combining HSNi with QVC will increase scale to more effectively compete in evolving retail and digital landscapes; 

• the expectation of realizing meaningful synergy opportunities; 

• the potential for financial optionality as a result of HSNi's low debt leverage; 

• the opportunity to improve the QVC Group's positioning as a stand-alone equity following the redemption of the Liberty Ventures common stock in connection
with the GCI transactions; 

• the opportunity to pursue integration opportunities to enable the combined company to operate more efficiently, fund innovation and enhance customer value
(including combining technology platforms, leveraging enhanced scale of supply chain and customer service networks, and reducing costs through purchasing
synergies); 

• the opportunity to optimize five US based networks and create complementary programming; 

• the opportunity to collaborate on best-in-class digital platforms (mobile, personalization, social, marketing) and next-gen shopping innovations; 

• the belief that the combined company will experience strengthened brand portfolios, including by extending top HSNi brands to QVC and zulily; 

• the opportunity to explore cross marketing opportunities to better engage existing and potential customers, and to share best practices and tools, leverage top talent
and create new professional growth opportunities; and 

• the opportunity to maintain a prudent capital structure with sufficient liquidity to service debt, repurchase stock or make strategic investments and acquisitions;

        The Liberty Interactive board also considered a number of uncertainties, risks and other potentially negative factors in its deliberations concerning the merger agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. These factors include (not necessarily in order of importance):

• the fact that the merger consideration to be paid by Liberty Interactive and received by the HSNi stockholders represents a significant premium on the value of
HSNi common stock; 

• the risk that the merger might not be completed in a timely manner or at all, including the risk that the failure to complete the merger could cause Liberty
Interactive to incur significant expenses and lead to negative perceptions among investors; 

• the fact that not all of the conditions to the completion of the merger, including the receipt of necessary third party and regulatory approvals, are within the parties'
control;

• the fact that the merger agreement contains certain restrictions on the ability of Liberty Interactive to conduct its business in the period between the signing of the
merger agreement and the closing of the merger, such that the consent of HSNi is required in respect of certain actions; 

• the substantial costs to be incurred by Liberty Interactive in connection with the merger and the merger agreement, regardless of whether the merger is
consummated, and the impact of such costs on Liberty Interactive's financial position; 

• the cost of continued compliance with legal, administrative and other requirements applicable to two separate public reporting companies; 

• the risk that the pendency of the merger could result in the disruption of the QVC Group's and HSNi's respective business, including the possible diversion of
management and employee attention away from day-to-day operations and potential adverse effects on the QVC Group's and HSNi's business relationships; 

• the risk that the benefits expected to be obtained following the merger may not be fully or timely realized; and 

• the risks described in the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements."

        After considering the positive and negative factors described above, the Liberty Interactive board determined that the anticipated benefits of the merger outweighed the risks
and costs and approved the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger.

        The foregoing discussion summarizes the material information and factors considered by the Liberty Interactive board in its consideration of the merger agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the merger. The Liberty Interactive board reached the unanimous decision to approve the merger agreement and the merger in light
of the factors described above and other factors that each member of the Liberty Interactive board felt were appropriate. In view of the variety of factors and the quality and
amount of information considered, the Liberty Interactive board did not find it practicable to, and did not, make specific assessments of, quantify or otherwise assign relative
weights to the specific factors considered in reaching its determination. Individual members of the Liberty Interactive board may have given different weights to different factors.

        The reason for the structure of the transaction is that Liberty Interactive believes that the acquisition of HSNi by means of a merger will improve the QVC Group's
competitive position by enabling it to more effectively compete in an evolving retail and digital landscape due to economies of scale, enhanced opportunities for synergy
initiatives and greater financial optionality in pursuing strategic business plans due to HSNi's relatively low debt leverage. The merger is being undertaken at this time by Liberty
Interactive in order to better position the QVC Group as a stand alone entity following the GCI transactions in an increasingly competitive marketplace.

        The explanation of Liberty Interactive's reasons for the merger agreement and the merger, and other information presented in this section is forward-looking in nature and,
accordingly, should be read in light of the factors described under "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" below.

        The HSNi board established the Special Committee to negotiate the terms of the merger on behalf of its unaffiliated stockholders with the assistance of independent legal
and financial advisors. In reaching the decision to recommend to the HSNi board the approval of the merger agreement, the merger and the transactions contemplated by the
merger agreement and to recommend that the HSNi stockholders vote to approve the adoption of the merger agreement, the Special Committee consulted extensively with its
financial and legal advisors and HSNi management, and considered other potential strategic alternatives. After such discussions and considering such alternatives, the Special
Committee unanimously determined the proposed merger to be advisable, fair to and in the best interests of, HSNi and the HSNi stockholders, including HSNi's unaffiliated
security holders, as defined in Rule 13E-3 of the Exchange Act.

        In reaching its decision to recommend that the HSNi stockholders vote to approve the adoption of the merger agreement, the merger and the transactions contemplated
thereby, the HSNi board consulted extensively with the Special Committee and the Special Committee's financial and legal advisors and HSNi management, and considered other
potential strategic alternatives. After such discussions and considering such alternatives, the HSNi board determined the proposed merger to be advisable, fair to and in the best
interests of, HSNi and the HSNi stockholders, including HSNi's unaffiliated security holders, as defined in Rule 13E-3 of the Exchange Act.

        The Special Committee's recommendation and the HSNi board's decision to approve the merger agreement, the merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby and
to recommend to the HSNi stockholders that they vote to approve the adoption of the merger agreement was based on a number of factors, including the following (which are not
necessarily presented in order of relative importance):

• their understanding of HSNi and its business as well as its financial performance, results of operations and future prospects; 

• the current and prospective competitive climate in the retail and e-commerce industry in which HSNi and Liberty Interactive operate and the belief that the merger
would create a leading global video e-commerce retail company with strong, focused businesses and with enhanced scale, optimized programming, and a
diversified product mix across segments, geographies and customers resulting in improved opportunities for growth, cost savings and innovation relative to what
HSNi could achieve on a standalone basis; 

• the aggregate value and composition of the merger consideration to be received by HSNi stockholders in the merger, which, based on the closing price of Liberty
QVCA common stock on July 5, 2017, represented a premium of approximately 29% over the closing price of HSNi common stock on the same date; 

• that the exchange ratio represents a fixed number of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock, which affords the HSNi stockholders the opportunity to benefit from
any increase in the trading price of Liberty QVCA common stock between the announcement of the execution of the merger agreement and the closing of the
merger; 

• following the merger, HSNi stockholders will have the opportunity to participate in the future growth of the combined company, including the projected synergies
at the combined company, and any general improvement in the retail market as a whole; 

• HSNi's management's expectation that the combined company could achieve at least approximately $100 million in annual operating synergies on a run rate basis,
as more fully described under the section entitled "—Unaudited Forecasted Financial Information." 

• the Special Committee's view, based on a range of synergy estimates developed by HSNi management, as more fully described below under the section entitled
"—Unaudited Forecasted

the merger;

• the oral opinion of Centerview Partners rendered to the Special Committee (with the other Qualified Directors present) on July 5, 2017, which was subsequently
confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated such date that, as of such date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters
considered, and qualifications and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview Partners in preparing its opinion, the merger consideration to be paid by
Liberty Interactive to the HSNi stockholders (other than as specified in such opinion) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to

consideration to be paid by Liberty Interactive for each share of HSNi common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to

Financial Advisor (Goldman Sachs);"

parties (taking into account the likelihood that Liberty Interactive would not support such a transaction), or remaining an independent public company, in each
case, considering the potential for HSNi stockholders to participate in the future growth of the combined company following the merger, including the projected
synergies of the combined company and any improvement in the retail market as a whole, as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with its business plans
or any alternative thereto and the ability to achieve a higher valuation than the merger; 

• their belief that (i) as discussed in the section entitled "Special Factors—Background of the Merger," it was unlikely that an alternative transaction with a different
counterparty would provide superior value to the HSNi stockholders as compared to a strategic transaction with Liberty Interactive and (ii) the terms of the merger
agreement were consistent with market practice and would not preclude or deter a willing and financially capable third party, were one to exist, from making a
superior transaction proposal following the announcement of the merger agreement; 

• their knowledge of, and discussions with HSNi management regarding, Liberty Interactive's business operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects and
its knowledge of Liberty Interactive's business, operations, financial condition, earnings and prospects, taking into account Liberty Interactive's publicly-filed
information and the results of HSNi's due diligence review of Liberty Interactive; 

• each of HSNi and Liberty Interactive has developed capabilities in complementary geographies and markets, the combination of which will create a larger and
more diversified company with a strategic global presence that is better equipped to respond to economic and industry developments and better positioned to
develop and build on its positioning in the retail and e-commerce segments as compared to either company on a standalone basis;

and the expected pro forma effect of the merger on the combined company; 

• the exchange ratio of 1.650 shares of Liberty QVCA common stock for each share of HSNi common stock was achieved by the Special Committee through
extensive, arm's-length negotiations, as described in the section entitled "—Background of the Merger;" 

• the Special Committee retained independent financial and legal advisors with knowledge and experience with respect to public merger and acquisition
transactions, HSNi's industry generally, and HSNi particularly, as well as substantial experience advising other companies with respect to similar transactions; 

• the review by the HSNi board and the Special Committee, together with the Special Committee's legal and financial advisors, of the structure of the proposed
merger and the financial and other terms of the merger agreement, including Liberty Interactive's representations, warranties and covenants, the conditions to its
obligations and the termination provisions and related termination fees, as well as the likelihood of consummation of the proposed merger and the Special
Committee's evaluation of the likely time period necessary to close the merger; and

Code as more fully described in the section entitled "—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences."

        The Special Committee and the HSNi board also considered the following specific aspects of the merger agreement (which are not necessarily presented in order of relative
importance):

• their belief that the terms of the merger agreement, including HSNi's representations, warranties and covenants and the conditions to each party's obligations, are
reasonable; 

• the merger agreement's inclusion of provisions allowing the HSNi board to, under certain circumstances, and subject to certain conditions, furnish information to
and conduct negotiations with a third party in connection with an unsolicited proposal for a business combination or acquisition of HSNi that constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to result in a superior transaction proposal; 

• the fact that the HSNi board, subject to certain conditions, has the right to make an adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement to enter
concurrently into a definitive agreement related to a superior transaction proposal, subject to giving Liberty Interactive notice and an opportunity to propose
changes to the merger agreement, and the payment of a termination fee of $40 million in the event of actual termination (which amount was determined after
consultation with its legal and financial advisors); 

• the fact that the HSNi board, subject to certain conditions, has the right to make an adverse recommendation change in response to an intervening event, even if
there is no competing or superior transaction proposal, if the HSNi board determines that the failure to take such action would be likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties, subject to the payment of a termination fee of $40 million in the event Liberty Interactive exercises its right to terminate the merger agreement as
a result of such change in recommendation; 

• the fact that the Special Committee and the HSNi board believed that such fee was consistent with market practice and would not preclude or deter a willing and
financially capable third party, were one to exist, from making a superior transaction proposal following the announcement of the transaction with Liberty
Interactive;

• the merger agreement's inclusion of provisions providing for a payment of $75 million by Liberty Interactive to HSNi if the merger agreement is terminated due to
the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals (which amount was determined after consultation with its legal and financial advisors); 

• the merger agreement's inclusion of provisions allowing HSNi to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends to the HSNi stockholders in an amount
up to $0.35 per share of HSNi common stock; and 

• the fact that, following the completion of the merger, one member of the current HSNi board will be added to the Liberty Interactive board.

        In the course of its deliberations, the Special Committee and the HSNi board also considered a variety of risks, uncertainties and other potentially negative factors, including
the following (which are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance):

• the risks and costs to HSNi if the merger is not completed, including the diversion of management and employee attention, potential employee attrition, the
potential effect on HSNi's business and relations with customers, suppliers and vendors and the potential impact on its stock price, and that, while the merger is
expected to be completed, there is no assurance that all conditions to the parties' obligations to complete the merger will be satisfied or waived, and as a result, it is
possible that the merger might not be completed even if approved by the HSNi stockholders; 

• the potential decrease of the implied value of the merger consideration that would result from a decrease in the trading price of Liberty QVCA common stock
without a corresponding decrease in the trading price of shares of HSNi common stock because the merger consideration is based on a fixed exchange ratio and
the merger agreement does not provide HSNi with a price-based termination right or adjustment for fluctuations in the trading price of Liberty QVCA common
stock; 

• the fact that the consummation of the merger is not conditioned on a majority approval of the minority HSNi stockholders (i.e., the HSNi stockholders other than
Liberty Interactive and its affiliates); 

• the possibility that regulatory agencies may not approve the merger or may impose terms and conditions on their approvals that adversely affect the business and
financial results of the combined company as more fully described in the section entitled "Special Factors—Regulatory Approvals;" 

• the transaction costs to be incurred in connection with the merger; 

• the merger agreement contains restrictions on the conduct of HSNi's business prior to completion of the merger, including the requirement that HSNi conduct its
business only in the ordinary course, subject to specific, pre-disclosed exceptions, which could delay or prevent HSNi from undertaking business opportunities
that may arise pending completion of the merger and could negatively affect HSNi's ability to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect decisions
of HSNi's customers and vendors; 

• the merger agreement imposes limitations on HSNi's ability to solicit alternative transactions prior to the closing of the merger and on its ability to terminate the
merger agreement, including a requirement that HSNi pay a $40 million termination fee in certain circumstances described in "—The Merger Agreement—
Termination Fees;"

• that if Liberty Interactive terminates the merger agreement prior to receipt of the requisite approval of the HSNi stockholders, in certain cases, and subject to
certain conditions, HSNi may be obligated to pay a $40 million termination fee to Liberty Interactive; 

• the possibility that Liberty Interactive will not realize all of the anticipated strategic and other benefits of the merger, including as a result of the challenges of
combining the businesses, operations and workforces of Liberty Interactive and HSNi, the risk that expected operating efficiencies and cost savings may not be
realized or will cost more to achieve than anticipated, and the risk that divestitures or other accommodations required by regulatory authorities may decrease the
anticipated strategic and other benefits of the merger to the combined company; 

• the possibility that the termination fee of $40 million could potentially deter a potential acquiror from proposing an alternative transaction that would provide
superior value to HSNi stockholders than the merger; 

• limitations on HSNi's ability to obtain alternative offers from third parties to acquire HSNi as a result of Liberty Interactive's approximately 38.2% ownership
position in HSNi and Liberty Interactive's position that it was not interested in selling its ownership stake in HSNi or supporting any such alternative transaction; 

• the fact that HSNi does not currently have a full time chief executive officer, and the merger agreement imposes limitations on HSNi's ability to fill that position; 

• Liberty Interactive's ability to, in certain cases, make changes to the GCI transactions, which could adversely affect the value of the Liberty QVCA common stock
to be issued to HSNi stockholders in the merger; 

• the fact that the GCI transactions might not ultimately be completed, in which case the potential benefits associated with the Liberty QVCA common stock
included in the merger consideration becoming an asset-based (as opposed to tracking) stock would not be realized (and, to the extent already reflected in the
Liberty QVCA common stock price, would likely be reversed); 

• the fact that once the merger closes, HSNi will not have the right to consent to changes to the terms of the GCI transactions; 

• the multi-class capital structure of Liberty Interactive; 

• the limited voting control that HSNi stockholders will have in the QVC Group following the closing of the merger; 

• the fact that HSNi's directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, those of HSNi stockholders
generally, including certain interests arising from the employment and compensation arrangements of HSNi's executive officers, and the manner in which they
would be affected by the merger as more fully described in the section entitled "—Interests of Certain persons of HSNi in the Merger;" and 

• various other risks described in the section entitled "Risk Factors."

        The Special Committee and the HSNi board considered all of these factors as a whole and expressly adopted the analyses and opinions of the financial advisors in reaching
their respective determinations that the proposed merger was advisable, fair to and in the best interests of, HSNi and the HSNi stockholders, including HSNi's unaffiliated
stockholders, as defined in Rule 13E-3 of the Exchange Act. The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Special Committee and the HSNi board is
not exhaustive. In view of the wide variety of factors considered by the Special Committee and the HSNi board in connection with their evaluation of the merger and the
complexity of these matters, the Special Committee and the HSNi board did not consider it practical to, nor did they attempt to, quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative
weights to the specific factors

that they considered in reaching their respective decisions. In considering the factors described above and any other factors, individual members of the Special Committee and the
HSNi board may have viewed factors differently or given different weight or merit to different factors.

        In considering the recommendation of the HSNi board that the HSNi stockholders vote to approve the adoption of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, HSNi stockholders should be aware that the executive officers and directors of HSNi may have certain interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition
to, the interests of HSNi stockholders generally. To avoid any actual conflict of interest or the appearance of any conflict of interest, the two individuals designated by Liberty
Interactive to the HSNi board recused themselves from all discussions and presentations regarding the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger.
The HSNi board was aware of these interests and considered them when approving the merger agreement and recommending that HSNi stockholders vote to approve and adopt
the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. See "—Interests of Certain Persons of HSNi in the Merger."

        The foregoing discussion of the information and factors considered by the Special Committee is forward-looking in nature. This information should be read in light of the
factors described in the section entitled "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements."

Unaudited Forecasted Financial Information 

        Liberty Interactive prepared unaudited forecasted financial information for the years 2017 through 2021 for the QVC Group on a stand-alone basis. HSNi prepared
unaudited forecasted financial information for the years 2017 through 2021 for HSNi on a stand-alone basis and, using unaudited forecasted financial information provided by
Liberty Interactive for the QVC Group, prepared unaudited forecasted financial information for the years 2017 through 2021 for the QVC Group on a standalone basis. The
unaudited forecasted financial information does not give effect to the merger. The unaudited forecasted financial information was prepared separately by each of the companies
using, in some cases, different assumptions, and is not intended to be added together. Adding the unaudited forecasted financial information together for the two companies
would not necessarily represent the results the combined company will achieve if the merger is completed and does not represent forecasted financial information for the
combined company if the merger is completed.

        Neither Liberty Interactive nor HSNi, as a matter of course, makes public long-term projections as to future revenues, earnings or other results due to, among other reasons,
the uncertainty of the underlying assumptions and estimates. However, the unaudited forecasted financial information set forth below was made available to the Special
Committee, the HSNi board, Centerview Partners and/or Goldman Sachs in connection with the evaluation of the merger. The inclusion of this information should not be
regarded as an indication that any of the Special Committee, HSNi, Centerview Partners, Goldman Sachs or any other recipient of this information considered, or now considers,
it to be necessarily predictive of actual future results. Readers of this document are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the unaudited forecasted financial information.

        The unaudited forecasted financial information was, in general, prepared solely for internal use and is subjective in many respects. As a result, there can be no assurance that
the forecasted results will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly higher or lower than estimated. Since the unaudited forecasted financial information covers
multiple years, such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each successive year. The estimates and assumptions underlying the unaudited forecasted financial
information involve judgments with respect to, among other things, future economic, competitive, regulatory and financial market conditions and future business decisions which
may not be realized and that are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of
Liberty Interactive

factors with respect to the business of Liberty Interactive and the SEC filings of HSNi for a description of risk factors with respect to the business of HSNi. See "Cautionary
Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements" and "Additional Information—Where You Can Find More Information," respectively. HSNi stockholders are also urged to
review the section entitled "Risk Factors." The unaudited forecasted financial information was not prepared with a view toward public disclosure, nor was it prepared with a view
toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC, the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of
prospective financial information or GAAP (including because certain metrics are non-GAAP measures) but, in the view of HSNi's management was prepared on a reasonable
basis, reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments, and presents, to the best of HSNi's management's knowledge and belief, the expected course of action and the
expected future financial performance of the QVC Group and HSNi, as applicable. However, this information is not fact and should not be relied upon as being necessarily
indicative of future results, and readers of this proxy statement/prospectus are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the unaudited forecasted financial information. Neither of
the independent registered public accounting firms of Liberty Interactive or HSNi nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures
with respect to the unaudited forecasted financial information contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its
achievability. The report of the independent registered public accounting firm of Liberty Interactive contained in Liberty's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2016 and the report of the independent registered public accounting firm of HSNi contained in HSNi's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2016, both of which are incorporated by reference into this document, relate to the historical financial information of Liberty Interactive and HSNi, respectively.
They do not extend to the unaudited forecasted financial information and should not be read to do so. Furthermore, the unaudited forecasted financial information does not take
into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared.

        NEITHER LIBERTY INTERACTIVE NOR HSNi INTEND TO UPDATE OR OTHERWISE REVISE THE UNAUDITED FORECASTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
TO REFLECT CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AFTER THE DATE WHEN MADE OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF FUTURE EVENTS, EVEN IN THE EVENT
THAT ANY OR ALL OF THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING SUCH PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION ARE NO LONGER APPROPRIATE, EXCEPT AS
MAY BE REQUIRED BY LAW.

Centerview Partners' analysis (which are referred to in this summary of Centerview Partners' opinion to as the synergies and are summarized above under the
section entitled "—Unaudited Forecasted Financial Information").

        Centerview Partners also participated in discussions with members of the senior management and representatives of HSNi and Liberty Interactive regarding their assessment
of the HSNi internal data (including, without limitation, the HSNi forecasts), the Liberty Interactive forecasts, the pro forma forecasts, the Liberty Interactive internal data and the
synergies, as appropriate, and the strategic rationale for the merger. In addition, Centerview Partners reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data, including
valuation multiples, for HSNi and Liberty Interactive (including shares of Liberty QVCA common stock) and compared that data with similar data for certain other companies,
the securities of which are publicly traded, in lines of business that Centerview Partners deemed relevant. Centerview Partners also compared certain of the proposed financial
terms of the merger with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that Centerview Partners deemed relevant and conducted such other
financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as Centerview Partners deemed appropriate.

        Centerview Partners assumed, without independent verification or any responsibility therefor, the accuracy and completeness of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax,
accounting and other information supplied to, discussed with, or reviewed by Centerview Partners for purposes of its opinion and has, with the Special Committee's consent,
relied upon such information as being complete and accurate. In that regard, Centerview Partners assumed, at the Special Committee's direction, that the HSNi internal data

reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Liberty Interactive as to the matters covered thereby, and
Centerview Partners relied, at the Special Committee's direction, on the HSNi internal data (including, without limitation, the HSNi forecasts), the Liberty Interactive forecasts,
the pro forma forecasts, the Liberty Interactive internal data and the synergies for purposes of Centerview Partners' analysis and opinion. Centerview Partners expressed no view
or opinion as to the HSNi internal data (including, without limitation, the HSNi forecasts), the Liberty Interactive forecasts, the pro forma forecasts, the Liberty Interactive
internal data and the synergies or the assumptions on which they are based. In addition, at the Special Committee's direction, Centerview Partners did not make any independent

furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal and was not asked to conduct, and did not conduct, a physical inspection of the properties or assets of HSNi or Liberty
Interactive. Centerview Partners assumed, at the Special Committee's direction, that the final executed merger agreement would not differ in any respect material to Centerview
Partners' analysis or opinion from the execution copy reviewed by Centerview Partners. Centerview Partners also assumed, at the Special Committee's direction, that the merger
will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws and other relevant documents or requirements, without delay or
the waiver, modification or amendment of any term, condition or agreement, the effect of which would be material to Centerview Partners' analysis or opinion and that, in the

employees of HSNi or any party, or class of such persons in connection with the merger, whether relative to the consideration to be paid by Liberty Interactive for each share of
HSNi common stock pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. Centerview Partners' opinion was necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, currency, market and
other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to Centerview Partners as of, the date of Centerview Partners' written opinion, and
Centerview Partners does not have any obligation or responsibility to update, revise or reaffirm its opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the

into account any feature of such shares other than the economic rights attaching to such shares. Centerview Partners expressed no view or opinion as to what the value of shares
of Liberty QVCA common stock actually will be when issued pursuant to the merger or the prices at which the shares of HSNi common stock or Liberty QVCA common stock
will trade or otherwise be transferable at any time, including following the announcement or consummation of the merger. Centerview Partners' opinion does not constitute a

Summary of Centerview Partners Financial Analysis

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses prepared and reviewed with the Special Committee (with the other Qualified Directors present) in connection
with Centerview Partners' opinion, dated July 5, 2017. The summary set forth below does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed or
factors considered by, and underlying the opinion of, Centerview Partners, nor does the order of the financial analyses described represent the relative importance or
weight given to those financial analyses by Centerview Partners. Centerview Partners may have deemed various assumptions more or less probable than other
assumptions, so the reference ranges resulting from any particular portion of the analyses summarized below should not be taken to be Centerview Partners' view of
the actual value of HSNi, Liberty Interactive or the QVC Group pro forma for the merger. Some of the summaries of the financial analyses set forth below include
information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary, as the
tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses performed by Centerview Partners. Considering the data in the tables below without
considering all financial analyses or factors or the full narrative description of such analyses or factors, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying such
analyses or factors, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying Centerview Partners' financial analyses and its opinion. In performing its
analyses, Centerview Partners made numerous assumptions with respect to industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters, many of which are
beyond the control of HSNi or any other parties to the merger. None of HSNi, Liberty Interactive, Merger Sub or Centerview Partners or any other person assumes responsibility
if future results are materially different from those discussed. Any estimates contained in these analyses are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future
results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of HSNi, Liberty Interactive or the QVC
Group pro forma for the merger do not purport to be appraisals or reflect the prices at which HSNi, Liberty Interactive or the QVC Group pro forma for the merger may actually
be sold. Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the financial analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. Except as
otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it existed on or before July 5, 2017 (the last
trading day before the public announcement of the merger), and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

Discounted Cash Flow Analyses

        Centerview Partners performed separate discounted cash flow analyses of HSNi and the QVC Group based on the internal data. A discounted cash flow analysis is a
traditional valuation methodology used to derive a valuation of an asset by calculating the "present value" of estimated future cash flows of the asset. "Present value" refers to the
current value of future cash flows and is obtained by discounting those future cash flows by a discount rate that takes into account macroeconomic assumptions and estimates of
risk, the opportunity cost of capital, expected returns and other appropriate factors.

HSNi

        Centerview Partners performed a discounted cash flow analysis of HSNi based on the HSNi internal data. In performing this analysis, Centerview Partners calculated a
range of illustrative equity values for HSNi by discounting to present value as of July 5, 2017, using discount rates ranging from 9.0% to 10.0% (reflecting Centerview Partners'
analysis of HSNi's weighted average cost of capital) and the mid-year convention: (a) (i) the forecasted unlevered after-tax free cash flows of HSNi over the period beginning
March 31, 2017 and ending December 31, 2021, utilizing the HSNi internal data as set forth in the section entitled "—Unaudited Forecasted Financial Information," and the
assumptions

provided by HSNi management, and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values of HSNi, calculated by Centerview Partners applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 1.0% to
3.0% to HSNi's after-tax unlevered free cash flows for the terminal year and (b) subtracting from the foregoing results the face value of HSNi's net debt as of March 31, 2017.
The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Centerview Partners utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the internal data, industry
conditions and trends and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Centerview Partners divided the result of the foregoing
calculations by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of HSNi common stock as of June 29, 2017 based on the HSNi internal data to derive a range of implied values per
share of HSNi common stock of $33.00 to $51.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00. Centerview Partners compared this range to the value of the merger consideration of $40.36 per
share implied by the 1.650 exchange ratio, based on the closing price of Liberty QVCA common stock on July 5, 2017 of $24.46 per share.

QVC Group

        Centerview Partners also performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the QVC Group based on the Liberty Interactive forecasts and the Liberty Interactive internal data. In
performing this analysis, Centerview Partners calculated a range of illustrative equity values for the QVC Group by discounting to present value as of July 5, 2017, using
discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 9.5% (reflecting Centerview Partners' analysis of QVC Group's weighted average cost of capital) and the mid-year convention: (a) (i) the
forecasted unlevered after-tax free cash flows of the QVC Group over the period beginning March 31, 2017 and ending December 31, 2021, utilizing the Liberty Interactive
forecasts and the Liberty Interactive internal data, each as set forth in the section entitled "—Unaudited Forecasted Financial Information," and the assumptions provided by
HSNi management, and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values of the QVC Group, calculated by Centerview Partners applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 1.0% to
3.0% to the QVC Group's after-tax unlevered free cash flows for the terminal year, (b) subtracting from the foregoing results (i) the face value of the QVC Group's net debt, as of
March 31, 2017 and (ii) the estimated market value of the QVC Group's non-controlling interests, and (c) adding to the foregoing results (i) the market value of Liberty
Interactive's stake in HSNi as of July 5, 2017 and (ii) the estimated market value of QVC Group's stake in its joint venture in China with Beijing-based CNR Media Group. The
range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Centerview Partners utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the internal data, industry
conditions and trends and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Centerview Partners divided the result of the foregoing
calculations by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Liberty QVCA common stock as of June 30, 2017 based on the Liberty Interactive internal data to derive a
range of implied values per share of Liberty QVCA common stock of $18.00 to $32.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00.

Selected Transactions Analysis

        Centerview Partners reviewed and compared certain information relating to the following selected transactions involving publicly traded companies in the retail industry
with a total enterprise value of at least $500 million (where sufficient public information was available to calculate enterprise value as a multiple of the last twelve months
EBITDA) announced since January 1, 2010 that Centerview Partners, based on its experience and professional judgment, deemed relevant to consider in relation to HSNi and the
merger.

        No company or transaction used in this analysis is identical or directly comparable to HSNi or the merger, respectively. The companies included in the selected transactions
listed above were selected, among other reasons, because they have certain characteristics that, for the purposes of this analysis, may be considered similar to certain
characteristics of HSNi. The transactions were selected, among other reasons, because their participants, size or other factors, for purposes of Centerview Partners' analysis, may
be considered similar to the merger. The reasons for and the circumstances surrounding each of the selected transactions analyzed were diverse and there are inherent differences
in the business, operations, financial conditions and prospects of HSNi and the companies included in the selected transactions analysis. Accordingly, Centerview Partners
believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected transactions analysis. This analysis involves complex
considerations and qualitative judgments concerning differences in financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or
other values of the selected target companies and HSNi.

        Financial data for the selected transactions were based solely on publicly available information at the time of the announcement of the relevant transactions that Centerview
Partners obtained from SEC filings and other data sources.

        Centerview Partners calculated, for each selected transaction set forth above, among other things, the enterprise value (which is defined as equity value, calculated using the
number of fully diluted shares of a company and using the treasury stock method, plus total debt and non-controlling interests, less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, less
equity method investments), which is referred to in this summary of Centerview Partners' opinion as EV, implied for the applicable target company based on the consideration
payable in the applicable selected transaction as a multiple of the target company's EBITDA for the latest twelve-month period for which financial information had been made
public, which is referred to in this summary of Centerview Partners' opinion as LTM Comparable EBITDA, at the time of the transaction announcement. The results of this
analysis are summarized as follows:

        Based on its analysis and other considerations that Centerview Partners deemed relevant in its professional judgment, Centerview Partners applied a range of multiples of
8.0x to 10.0x to HSNi's LTM Comparable EBITDA of $269 million for the period ended March 31, 2017, as reflected in the HSNi internal data, which resulted in a range of
implied values per share of HSNi common stock of approximately $31.00 to $41.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00. Centerview Partners compared this range to the value of the
merger consideration of $40.36 per share implied by the 1.650 exchange ratio, based on the closing price of Liberty QVCA common stock on July 5, 2017 of $24.46 per share.

Selected Public Companies Analyses

        Centerview Partners reviewed and compared certain financial information, ratios and public market multiples for HSNi and the QVC Group to corresponding financial
information, ratios and public market multiples of the following publicly traded companies in the specialty, home stores, department/mass and eCommerce retail industries that
Centerview Partners deemed comparable, based on its experience and professional judgment, to HSNi and the QVC Group, which are referred to in this summary of Centerview
Partners' opinion as the selected companies:

        Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to HSNi or the QVC Group, the companies listed above were chosen by Centerview Partners, among other
reasons, because they are publicly traded companies with certain operational, business and/or financial characteristics that, for purposes of Centerview Partners' analysis, may be
considered similar to those of HSNi and the QVC Group. However, because none of the selected companies is exactly the same as HSNi or the QVC Group, Centerview Partners
believed that it was inappropriate to, and therefore did not, rely solely on the quantitative results of the selected public company analysis. Accordingly, Centerview Partners also
made qualitative judgments, based on its experience and professional judgment, concerning differences between the business, financial and operating characteristics and
prospects of HSNi, the QVC Group and the selected companies that could affect the public trading values of each in order to provide a context in which to consider the results of
the quantitative analysis.

        Using publicly available information obtained from SEC filings and other data sources as of July 5, 2017, Centerview Partners also calculated and compared various
financial multiples for the selected companies, HSNi and the QVC Group. With respect to the selected companies, HSNi and the QVC Group, Centerview Partners calculated:

• price as a multiple of next twelve months earnings per share (after deduction of stock-based compensation expense and before deduction of after-tax intangible
amortization from earnings per share), which is referred to in this summary of Centerview Partners' opinion as Comparable EPS, and which multiple is referred
to in this summary of Centerview Partners' opinion as Price/Comparable EPS; and

• enterprise value as a multiple of next twelve months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (after deduction of stock-based compensation
expense), which is referred to in this summary of Centerview Partners' opinion as Comparable EBITDA, and which multiple is referred to in this summary of
Centerview Partners' opinion as NTM EV/Comparable EBITDA.

        The results of these analyses are summarized as follows:

HSNi

        Based on the foregoing analysis and other considerations that Centerview Partners deemed relevant in its professional judgment, Centerview Partners (i) applied a range of
12.0x to 16.0x to HSNi's estimated next twelve months Comparable EPS of $2.70 based on the HSNi internal data, which resulted in a range of implied values per share of HSNi
common stock of $32.00 to $43.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00, and (ii) applied a range of multiples of 7.0x to 9.0x to HSNi's next twelve months estimated Comparable
EBITDA of approximately $294 million based on the HSNi internal data, which resulted in a range of implied values per share of HSNi common stock of $29.00 to $40.00,
rounded to the nearest $1.00. Centerview Partners compared these ranges to the value of the merger consideration of $40.36 per share implied by the exchange ratio (calculated
by multiplying the 1.650 exchange ratio by the $24.46 closing price per share of Liberty QVCA common stock on July 5, 2017).

QVC Group

        Based on the foregoing analysis and other considerations that Centerview Partners deemed relevant in its professional judgment, Centerview Partners applied a range of
multiples of 7.0x to 9.0x to the QVC Group's next twelve months estimated Comparable EBITDA of approximately $1,957 million, based on the Liberty Interactive forecasts,
which resulted in a range of implied values of $17.00 to $25.00 per share of Liberty QVCA common stock, rounded to the nearest $1.00.

Certain Additional Information

        Centerview Partners observed certain additional information that was not considered part of its financial analyses for its opinion but was noted for informational purposes,
including, among other things, the following:

General

        The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis
and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances and, therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description. In arriving at its
opinion, Centerview Partners did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any factor or analysis that it considered. Rather, Centerview Partners made its
determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses.

        Centerview Partners' financial analyses and opinion were only one of many factors taken into consideration by the Special Committee in their evaluation of the merger.
Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative of the views of the Special Committee or the HSNi board with respect to the exchange ratio or
as to whether the Special Committee or the HSNi board would have been willing to determine that a different consideration was fair. The consideration for the merger was
determined through arm's-length negotiations between the Special Committee and Liberty Interactive and was recommended by the Special Committee and approved by the
HSNi board. Centerview Partners provided advice to the Special Committee during these negotiations. Centerview Partners did not, however recommend any specific amount of
consideration to the Special Committee or the HSNi board that any specific amount of consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the merger.

        Centerview Partners is a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking, financial advisory and merchant
banking activities. In the two years prior to the delivery of its opinion, except for Centerview Partners' current engagement by the Special Committee, Centerview Partners has
not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to HSNi, and, except in connection with such current engagement, Centerview Partners has not received any
compensation from HSNi. In the two years prior to the delivery of its opinion, Centerview Partners has not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to
Liberty Interactive or Merger Sub and Centerview Partners has not received any compensation from Liberty Interactive or Merger Sub. Centerview Partners may provide
investment banking and other services to or with respect to HSNi, Liberty Interactive or their respective affiliates in the future, for which Centerview Partners may receive
compensation. Certain (i) of Centerview Partners and its affiliates' directors, officers, members and employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of Centerview Partners'
affiliates or related investment funds and (iii) investment funds or other persons in which any of the foregoing may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest,
may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt, equity and other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or investments
in, HSNi, Liberty Interactive or any of their respective affiliates, or any other party that may be involved in the merger.

Table of Contents

        The Special Committee selected Centerview Partners as its financial advisor in connection with the merger because it is an internationally recognized investment banking
firm that has substantial experience in transactions similar to the merger.

        In connection with Centerview Partners' services as the financial advisor to the Special Committee, HSNi has agreed to pay Centerview Partners an aggregate fee that is
estimated, based on the information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $20 million, of which $1 million was payable upon the execution of the
engagement letter, $1 million was payable upon the rendering of Centerview Partners' opinion and the remainder is payable contingent upon consummation of the merger. In
addition, HSNi has agreed to reimburse certain of Centerview Partners' expenses arising, and to indemnify Centerview Partners against certain liabilities that may arise, out of
Centerview Partners' engagement.

        To resolve certain concerns raised by Liberty Interactive about the aggregate transaction fees payable to Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners by HSNi under their
respective engagement letters in light of Liberty Interactive's existing significant equity interest in HSNi, Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners orally advised Liberty
Interactive that, to the extent they were engaged in the future to provide investment banking advisory services to Liberty Interactive or certain entities controlled by Liberty
Interactive, each would provide, depending on the circumstances, a credit of up to $5,000,000 toward such engagement. The foregoing discussion did not include any
commitment or agreement by Liberty Interactive to hire Goldman Sachs or Centerview Partners for future work or any commitment or agreement by Goldman Sachs or
Centerview Partners to provide any future investment banking advisory services to Liberty Interactive or any other entity.

Opinion of the Special Committee Financial Advisor (Goldman Sachs) 

        Goldman Sachs rendered its opinion to the Special Committee (with the other Qualified Directors present) that, as of July 5, 2017, and based upon and subject to the factors
and assumptions set forth therein, the consideration to be paid by Liberty Interactive for each share of HSNi common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a
financial point of view to the HSNi stockholders (other than the Liberty Interactive related entities).

        The full text of the written opinion of Goldman Sachs, dated July 5, 2017, which sets forth assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations on the review undertaken in connection with the opinion, is attached as Annex D to this proxy statement/prospectus and is incorporated herein by reference.
Goldman Sachs provided its opinion for the information and assistance of the Special Committee and, at the Special Committee's request, the information and
assistance of the HSNi board in connection with their consideration of the merger. The Goldman Sachs opinion is not a recommendation as to how any HSNi
stockholder should vote with respect to the merger, or any other matter.

        In connection with rendering the opinion described above and performing its related financial analyses, Goldman Sachs reviewed, among other things:

• the merger agreement; 

• annual reports to stockholders and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of HSNi and Liberty Interactive for the five fiscal years ended December 31, 2016; 

• certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of HSNi and Liberty Interactive; 

• certain other communications from HSNi and Liberty Interactive to their respective stockholders; 

• certain publicly available research analyst reports for HSNi and Liberty Interactive; and

management of HSNi (based on forecasts that were initially prepared by the management of Liberty Interactive) as summarized above under "—Unaudited
Forecasted Financial Information—Unaudited Forecasted Financial Information Prepared by Liberty Interactive," and certain financial analyses and forecasts for
the QVC Group pro forma for the merger prepared by the management of HSNi, in each case, as approved for Goldman Sachs' use by the Special Committee,
which are summarized above under "—Unaudited Forecasted Financial Information—Unaudited Forecasted Financial Information Prepared by HSNi" and are
referred to in this summary of Goldman Sachs' opinion as the Forecasts, including certain operating synergies projected by the management of HSNi to result
from the merger, as approved for Goldman Sachs' use by the Special Committee, which are referred to in this summary of Goldman Sachs' opinion as the
Synergies.

        Goldman Sachs also held discussions with members of the senior managements of HSNi and Liberty Interactive regarding their assessment of the strategic rationale for, and
the potential benefits of, the merger and the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of Liberty Interactive; held discussions with members
of the senior management of HSNi regarding their assessment of the past and current business operations, financial condition and future prospects of HSNi; reviewed the
reported price and trading activity for the HSNi common stock and Liberty QVCA common stock; compared certain financial and stock market information for HSNi and Liberty
Interactive with similar information for certain other companies the securities of which are publicly traded; reviewed the financial terms of certain recent business combinations
in the specialty, home, department/mass and eCommerce retail industries and in other industries; and performed such other studies and analyses, and considered such other
factors, as it deemed appropriate.

        For purposes of rendering its opinion, Goldman Sachs, with the consent of the Special Committee, relied upon and assumed the accuracy and completeness of all of the
financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other information provided to, discussed with or reviewed by, it, without assuming any responsibility for independent verification
thereof. In that regard, Goldman Sachs assumed with the consent of the Special Committee that the Forecasts, including the Synergies, were reasonably prepared on a basis
reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of HSNi. Goldman Sachs did not make an independent evaluation or appraisal of the assets and
liabilities (including any contingent, derivative or other off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities) of HSNi or Liberty Interactive or any of their respective subsidiaries and it was
not furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal. Goldman Sachs assumed that all governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation
of the merger will be obtained without any adverse effect on HSNi or Liberty Interactive or on the expected benefits of the merger in any way meaningful to its analysis.
Goldman Sachs also assumed that the merger will be consummated on the terms set forth in the merger agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition
the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to its analysis.

        Goldman Sachs' opinion does not address the underlying business decision of HSNi to engage in the merger or the relative merits of the merger as compared to any strategic
alternatives that may be available to HSNi; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. Goldman Sachs was not requested to solicit, and did not solicit,
interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination with, HSNi or any other alternative merger. Goldman Sachs' opinion addresses only the
fairness from a financial point of view to the HSNi stockholders (other than the Liberty Interactive related entities and their respective affiliates), as of the date of the opinion, of
the consideration to be paid by Liberty Interactive for each share of HSNi common stock pursuant to the merger agreement. Goldman Sachs' opinion does not express any view

or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of HSNi, or class of such persons in connection with the merger, whether
relative to the consideration to be paid by Liberty Interactive for each share of HSNi common stock pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise. With respect to the shares of
Liberty QVCA common stock to be issued pursuant to the merger, Goldman Sachs did not take into account any feature of such shares other than the economic rights attaching to
such shares. Goldman Sachs's opinion did not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Liberty QVCA common stock will trade at any time or as to the impact of
the merger on the solvency or viability of HSNi, Liberty Interactive or the QVC Group or the ability of HSNi, Liberty Interactive or the QVC Group to pay their respective
obligations when they come due. Goldman Sachs' opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary market and other conditions, as in effect on, and the information made
available to it as of the date of the opinion and Goldman Sachs assumed no responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming its opinion based on circumstances, developments

        The following is a summary of the material financial analyses delivered by Goldman Sachs to the Special Committee (with the other Qualified Directors present) in
connection with rendering the opinion described above. The following summary, however, does not purport to be a complete description of the financial analyses performed by
Goldman Sachs, nor does the order of analyses described represent relative importance or weight given to those analyses by Goldman Sachs. Some of the summaries of the
financial analyses include information presented in tabular format. The tables must be read together with the full text of each summary and are alone not a complete description
of Goldman Sachs' financial analyses. Except as otherwise noted, the following quantitative information, to the extent that it is based on market data, is based on market data as it
existed on or before July 5, 2017, the last trading day before the public announcement of the merger, and is not necessarily indicative of current market conditions.

Historical Stock Trading Analysis

        Goldman Sachs analyzed the $40.36 implied per share consideration (calculated by multiplying the 1.650 exchange ratio by the $24.46 closing price per share of Liberty
QVCA common stock on July 5, 2017) to be paid to HSNi stockholders (other than Liberty Interactive and its wholly owned subsidiaries) pursuant to the merger agreement in
relation to (a) the closing price per share of HSNi common stock on July 5, 2017, (b) the highest and lowest closing prices per share of HSNi common stock over the 52-week
period ended July 5, 2017, and the volume weighted average prices per share of the HSNi common stock over the 30- and 90-day periods ended July 5, 2017.

        This analysis indicated that the implied per share consideration to be paid to HSNi stockholders (other than Liberty Interactive and its wholly owned subsidiaries) pursuant
to the merger agreement represented:

• a premium of 28.9% based on the closing price of $31.30 per share on July 5, 2017; 

• a discount of 23.8% based on the highest closing price of $52.99 per share for the 52-week period ended July 5, 2017; 

• a premium of 30.4% based on the lowest closing price of $30.95 per share for the 52-week period ended July 5, 2017; 

• a premium of 23.8% based on the volume weighted average price of $32.60 per share for the 30-day period ended July 5, 2017; and

Selected Companies Analysis

        Goldman Sachs reviewed and compared certain financial information, ratios and public market multiples for HSNi and the QVC Group to corresponding financial
information, ratios and public market multiples for the following publicly traded corporations in the specialty, home stores, department/mass and eCommerce retail industries,
which are referred to in this summary of Goldman Sachs' opinion, collectively, as the selected companies:

        Although none of the selected companies is directly comparable to HSNi or the QVC Group, the companies included were chosen because they are publicly traded
companies with operations that for purposes of analysis may be considered similar to certain operations of HSNi and the QVC Group.

        Goldman Sachs also calculated and compared various financial multiples for the selected companies, HSNi and the QVC Group based on financial and trading data as of
July 5, 2017, as well as information it obtained from SEC filings and Wall Street research. With respect to the selected companies, HSNi and the QVC Group, Goldman Sachs
calculated:

• price as a multiple of next twelve months earnings per share (after deduction of stock-based compensation expense and before deduction of after-tax intangible
amortization from earnings per share), which is referred to in this summary of Goldman Sachs' opinion as Comparable EPS, and which multiple is referred to in

        While none of the target companies that participated in the selected transactions are directly comparable to HSNi, the companies that participated in the selected transactions
are companies with operations that, for the purposes of analysis, may be considered similar to certain of HSNi's results, market size and product profile.

        For each of the selected transactions, Goldman Sachs calculated and compared enterprise value as a multiple of the last twelve months Comparable EBITDA. The analysis
reflected multiples at the 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile of 7.2x, 9.4x and 11.3x, respectively. Goldman Sachs then applied a range of 8.0x to 10.0x to HSNi's last
twelve months Comparable EBITDA, which analysis resulted in a range of illustrative implied prices per share of HSNi common stock of approximately $31.00 to $41.00,
rounded to the nearest $1.00.

Illustrative Present Value of Future Share Price Analysis

        Goldman Sachs performed illustrative analyses of the implied present value of the future value per share of HSNi common stock and Liberty QVCA common stock, in each

indication of the present value of a theoretical future value of the equity of HSNi and the QVC Group, in each case on a stand-alone basis, and the QVC Group pro forma for the
merger, respectively, as a function of the estimated one-year forward enterprise value to future EBITDA multiple, which is referred to in this summary of Goldman Sachs'
opinion as the one-year forward EV/EBITDA multiple.

HSNi Stand-Alone

        For the analysis of shares of HSNi common stock on a stand-alone basis, Goldman Sachs first used the Forecasts for fiscal years 2018 through 2021 to calculate implied
values per share of HSNi common stock on a stand-alone basis as of January 1 for each of the fiscal years 2018 to 2021. Then, Goldman Sachs applied a range of enterprise value
to one-year forward EV/EBITDA multiples of 7.0x to 9.0x to HSNi's Comparable EBITDA, based upon Goldman Sachs' professional judgment and experience, taking into
account several factors, including analysis of the one-year forward EV/EBITDA multiples of HSNi, the QVC Group and the selected companies, and then discounted the implied
future value of the share price, including dividends, back to March 31, 2017, using an illustrative discount rate of 9.5%, reflecting an estimate of HSNi's cost of equity. This
analysis resulted in a range of illustrative implied present values of $33.55 to $49.99 per share of HSNi common stock.

QVC Group Stand-Alone

        For the analysis of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock on a stand-alone basis, Goldman Sachs first used the Forecasts for fiscal years 2018 through 2021 to calculate
implied values per share of Liberty QVCA common stock on a stand-alone basis as of January 1 for each of the fiscal years 2018 to 2021. Then, Goldman Sachs applied a range
of enterprise value to one-year forward EV/EBITDA multiples of 7.0x to 9.0x, based upon Goldman Sachs' professional judgment and experience, taking into account several
factors, including analysis of the one-year forward EV/EBITDA multiples of the QVC Group, HSNi and the selected companies, to the QVC Group's Comparable EBITDA, and
then discounted the implied future value of the share price, including dividends, back to March 31, 2017, using an illustrative discount rate of 11.0%, reflecting an estimate of the
QVC Group's cost of equity. This analysis resulted in a range of illustrative implied present values of $17.22 to $29.53 per share of Liberty QVCA common stock.

QVC Group Pro Forma

        For the analysis of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock pro forma for the merger, Goldman Sachs first used the Forecasts for fiscal years 2018 through 2021, including
the Synergies, to calculate implied values per share of Liberty QVCA common stock pro forma for the merger as of January 1 for each of the fiscal years 2018 to 2021. Then,
Goldman Sachs applied a range of enterprise value to one-year forward EV/EBITDA multiples of 7.0x to 9.0x, based upon Goldman Sachs' professional judgment and
experience, taking into account several factors, including analysis of the one-year forward EV/EBITDA multiples of HSNi, the QVC Group and the selected companies, to the
QVC Group's Comparable EBITDA pro forma for the merger, and then discounted the implied future value of the share price, including dividends, back to March 31, 2017, using
an illustrative discount rate of 11.0%, reflecting an estimate of the QVC Group's cost of equity pro forma for the merger. This analysis resulted in a range of illustrative implied
present values of $22.14 to $35.19 per share of Liberty QVCA common stock pro forma for the merger.

        Goldman Sachs then calculated an illustrative range of implied present values of the merger consideration by multiplying this range of illustrative implied present values per
share of Liberty QVCA common stock by the exchange ratio of 1.650. This analysis yielded an illustrative range of implied values per share of $36.52 to $58.06.

Illustrative Discounted Cash Flow Analysis

        Goldman Sachs performed illustrative discounted cash flow analyses on HSNi, the QVC Group stand-alone and the QVC Group pro forma for the merger, in each case
using the Forecasts (which, in the case of the pro forma combined company, included the Synergies).

HSNi Stand-Alone

        For the discounted cash flow analysis of HSNi on a stand-alone basis, using discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 9.5%, reflecting estimates of HSNi's weighted average cost
of capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of March 31, 2017 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for HSNi for the years 2017 through 2021 as reflected in the
Forecasts as set forth in the section entitled "—Unaudited Forecasted Financial Information," and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for HSNi, which were calculated by
applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow to be generated by HSNi, as reflected in the Forecasts.
The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into account the Forecasts and market
expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise values for HSNi by adding the
ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman Sachs then subtracted from this range of illustrative enterprise values HSNi's net debt as of March 31, 2017, as provided by
the management of HSNi, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for HSNi. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of
fully diluted outstanding shares of HSNi as of June 29, 2017, as provided by the management of HSNi, to derive a range of illustrative present values per share ranging from
$36.42 to $53.98.

QVC Group Stand-Alone

        For the discounted cash flow analysis of the QVC Group, using discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 9.5%, reflecting estimates of the QVC Group's weighted average cost of
capital, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of March 31, 2017 (i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for the QVC Group for the years 2017 through 2021 as
reflected in the Forecasts as set forth in the section entitled "—Unaudited Forecasted Financial Information," and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for the QVC Group,
which were calculated by applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow to be generated by the
QVC Group, as reflected in the Forecasts. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into
account the Forecasts and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise
values for the QVC Group by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. From the range of illustrative enterprise values it derived for the QVC Group, Goldman Sachs
then (a) subtracted (i) net debt as of March 31, 2017, as provided by the management of HSNi and (ii) the estimated market value of the QVC Group's non-controlling interests
and (b) added (i) the market value of Liberty Interactive's stake in HSNi as of July 5, 2017 and (ii) the estimated market value of QVC Group's stake in its joint venture in China
with Beijing-based CNR Media Group to derive a range of illustrative equity values for the QVC Group. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it
derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of Liberty QVCA common stock as of June 30, 2017, as provided by the management of HSNi, to derive a range of
illustrative present values per share ranging from $19.79 to $32.31.

QVC Group Pro Forma

        For the discounted cash flow analysis of the QVC Group pro forma for the merger, using discount rates ranging from 8.0% to 9.5%, reflecting estimates of the QVC Group's
weighted average cost of capital pro forma for the merger, Goldman Sachs discounted to present value as of March 31, 2017

(i) estimates of unlevered free cash flow for the QVC Group pro forma for the merger for the years 2017 through 2021 as reflected in the Forecasts as set forth in the section
entitled "—Unaudited Forecasted Financial Information," and (ii) a range of illustrative terminal values for the QVC Group pro forma for the merger, which were calculated by
applying perpetuity growth rates ranging from 1.5% to 2.5%, to a terminal year estimate of the unlevered free cash flow to be generated by the QVC Group pro forma for the
merger, as reflected in the Forecasts. The range of perpetuity growth rates was estimated by Goldman Sachs utilizing its professional judgment and experience, taking into
account the Forecasts and market expectations regarding long-term real growth of gross domestic product and inflation. Goldman Sachs derived ranges of illustrative enterprise
values for the QVC Group pro forma for the merger by adding the ranges of present values it derived above. Goldman Sachs then (a) subtracted (i) net debt as of March 31, 2017,
as provided by the management of HSNi and (ii) the estimated market value of the QVC Group's non-controlling interests and (b) added the estimated market value of
QVC Group's stake in its joint venture in China with Beijing-based CNR Media Group, to derive a range of illustrative equity values for the QVC Group pro forma for the
merger. Goldman Sachs then divided the range of illustrative equity values it derived by the number of fully diluted outstanding shares of common stock of the QVC Group pro
forma for the merger as of June 29, 2017 (for HSNi common stock) and June 30, 2017 (for Liberty QVCA common stock), as provided by the management of HSNi to derive a
range of illustrative present values per share of Liberty QVCA common stock pro forma for the merger. Goldman Sachs then multiplied the exchange ratio of 1.650 by this range
of illustrative present values per share of Liberty QVCA common stock to obtain an illustrative range of implied values of the per share merger consideration of $37.26 to
$60.97.

Illustrative Premiums Paid Analysis

        Using information obtained from public filings, public databases and press reports, Goldman Sachs analyzed certain information relating to all-stock consideration
acquisition transactions since 2007, with a total enterprise value of at least $500 million, with a U.S. target in which the target's shareholders owned less than 35% of the pro

based on the last closing price per share of the Liberty QVCA common stock before announcement of the merger, in relation to the closing trading price of HSNi common stock
one trading day earlier:

        Based on these calculations, the 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile of premiums in these transactions were 17%, 25% and 36%, respectively. Goldman Sachs then
applied a range of premiums

of 15% to 35% to the closing trading price per share of HSNi common stock on July 5, 2017, which analysis resulted in a range of implied prices per share of HSNi common
stock of approximately $36.00 to $42.00, rounded to the nearest $1.00.

        The preparation of a fairness opinion is a complex process and is not necessarily susceptible to partial analysis or summary description. Selecting portions of the analyses or
of the summary set forth above, without considering the analyses as a whole, could create an incomplete view of the processes underlying Goldman Sachs' opinion. In arriving at
its fairness determination, Goldman Sachs considered the results of all of its analyses and did not attribute any particular weight to any factor or analysis considered by it. Rather,
Goldman Sachs made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of its analyses. No company or
transaction used in the above analyses as a comparison is directly comparable to HSNi or the QVC Group or the contemplated transaction.

        Goldman Sachs prepared these analyses for purposes of Goldman Sachs' providing its opinion to the Special Committee (with the other Qualified Directors present) as to the
fairness from a financial point of view to the HSNi stockholders (other than the Liberty Interactive related entities and their respective affiliates), as of the date of the opinion, of
the exchange ratio pursuant to the merger agreement. These analyses do not purport to be appraisals nor do they necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities
actually may be sold. Analyses based upon forecasts of future results are not necessarily indicative of actual future results, which may be significantly more or less favorable than
suggested by these analyses. Because these analyses are inherently subject to uncertainty, being based upon numerous factors or events beyond the control of the parties or their
respective advisors, none of HSNi, Liberty Interactive, Goldman Sachs or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are materially different from those forecast.

        The consideration to be paid by Liberty Interactive for each share of HSNi common stock pursuant to the merger agreement was determined through arm's-length
negotiations between the Special Committee and Liberty Interactive and was recommended by the Special Committee and approved by the HSNi board. Goldman Sachs
provided advice to the Special Committee during these negotiations. Goldman Sachs did not, however, recommend any specific exchange ratio to the Special Committee or the
HSNi board or that any specific exchange ratio constituted the only appropriate exchange ratio for the merger.

        As described above, Goldman Sachs' opinion to the Special Committee was one of many factors taken into consideration by the Special Committee and the HSNi board in
making their determination with respect to the merger agreement. The foregoing summary does not purport to be a complete description of the analyses performed by Goldman
Sachs in connection with the fairness opinion and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the written opinion of Goldman Sachs attached as Annex D of this proxy
statement/prospectus.

        Goldman Sachs and its affiliates are engaged in advisory, underwriting and financing, principal investing, sales and trading, research, investment management and other
financial and non-financial activities and services for various persons and entities. Goldman Sachs and its affiliates and employees, and funds or other entities they manage or in
which they invest or have other economic interests or with which they co-invest, may at any time purchase, sell, hold or vote long or short positions and investments in securities,
derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments of HSNi, the Liberty Interactive related entities or any of their respective
affiliates, or any currency or commodity that may be involved in the merger. Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor to the Special Committee in connection with, and
participated in certain of the negotiations leading to, the merger. Goldman Sachs has provided certain financial advisory and/or underwriting services to the entities referred to,
solely for the purpose of Goldman Sachs' opinion, as "Liberty Interactive related entities" and/or their respective affiliates from time to time for which the

Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs has received, and may receive, compensation, including having acted as financial advisor to Liberty Global plc, which is
referred to in this summary of Goldman Sachs' opinion as Liberty Global and is a Liberty Interactive related entity, in connection with the issuance of Liberty Global's LiLAC
Group Tracking Stock in July 2015; as financial advisor to Expedia, Inc., which is a subsidiary of Liberty Expedia (incorrectly identified as a subsidiary of Liberty Media in the
fairness opinion) and is a Liberty Interactive related entity, in connection with its acquisition of HomeAway, Inc. in December 2015; as financial advisor to Telenet Group
Holding N.V., a subsidiary of Liberty Global, in connection with its acquisition of BASE Company N.V. in February 2016; as financial advisor to Liberty Global in connection
with its acquisition of Cable & Wireless Communications Plc in May 2016; as placement agent with respect to a private offering of 1.75% exchangeable senior debentures due
2046 (aggregate principal amount of $750,000,000) by Liberty Interactive in August 2016; as bookrunner with respect to a public offering by Ziggo Group Holding B.V., a
subsidiary of Liberty Global, of its 6.000% senior notes due 2027 (aggregate principal amount of $625,000,000), its 5.500% senior secured notes due 2027 (aggregate principal
amount of $2,000,000,000) and its 4.250% senior secured notes due 2027 (aggregate principal amount of €775,000,000) in September 2016; as a joint bookrunner in connection
with the initial public offering of 30,026,635 American Depository Shares, representing 30,026,635 Class A shares, of Trivago N.V., which is a subsidiary of Expedia, Inc.,
(incorrectly identified as a subsidiary of Liberty Media in the fairness opinion) in December 2016; as bookrunner with respect to a dollar-denominated term loan refinancing
(aggregate principal amount of $2,525,000,000) and a euro-denominated term loan refinancing (aggregate principal amount of €2,250,000,000) for VodafoneZiggo Group
Holding B.V., which is an affiliate of Liberty Global, in January 2017; and as bookrunner in connection with a convertible financing (aggregate principal amount of
$300,000,000) for LendingTree, which is a Liberty Interactive related entity, in May 2017. During the two-year period ended July 5, 2017, Goldman Sachs has received
compensation for financial advisory and/or underwriting services provided by its Investment Banking Division to the Liberty Interactive related entities of approximately
$45.5 million. Goldman Sachs may also in the future provide financial advisory and/or underwriting services to HSNi, the Liberty Interactive related entities and their respective
affiliates for which the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs may receive compensation.

        The Special Committee selected Goldman Sachs as its financial advisor because it is an internationally recognized investment banking firm that has substantial experience in
transactions similar to the merger. Pursuant to a letter agreement dated June 23, 2017, the Special Committee engaged Goldman Sachs to act as its financial advisor in connection
with the contemplated merger. The engagement letter between the Special Committee and Goldman Sachs provides for a transaction fee that is estimated, based on the
information available as of the date of announcement, at approximately $20,000,000, $1,000,000 of which became payable upon the execution of the engagement letter,
$1,000,000 of which became payable upon delivery of the opinion, and the reminder of which is contingent upon consummation of the merger. In addition, HSNi has agreed to
reimburse Goldman Sachs for certain of its expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, and to indemnify Goldman Sachs and related persons against various
liabilities, including certain liabilities under the federal securities laws.

        To resolve certain concerns raised by Liberty Interactive about the aggregate transaction fees payable to Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners by HSNi under their
respective engagement letters in light of Liberty Interactive's existing significant equity interest in HSNi, Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners orally advised Liberty
Interactive that, to the extent they were engaged in the future to provide investment banking advisory services to Liberty Interactive or certain entities controlled by Liberty
Interactive, each would provide, depending on the circumstances, a credit of up to $5,000,000 toward such engagement. The foregoing discussion did not include any
commitment or agreement by Liberty Interactive to hire Goldman Sachs or Centerview Partners for future work or any

Other Presentations by Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs 

        In addition to the presentation made to the Special Committee (with the other Qualified Directors present) on July 5, 2017, described under "—Opinion of the Special
Committee Financial Advisor (Centerview Partners)" and "—Opinion of the Special Committee Financial Advisor (Goldman Sachs)," Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs
also made joint written and oral preliminary presentations to the Special Committee, and, in some cases, the HSNi board, on January 13, 2017, January 30, 2017, February 9,

2017, June 13, 2017, and June 22, 2017. Copies of these joint written materials have been attached as exhibits to the Schedule 13E-3 filed with the SEC in connection with the
merger. Certain analyses contained in the joint written presentations were prepared solely by either Centerview Partners (including analyses labeled in the presentations
"Centerview Perspective," "Centerview Partners" or "Centerview") or by Goldman Sachs (including analyses labeled in the presentations "Goldman Sachs Perspective" or
"Goldman Sachs"). These joint written presentations will be available to any interested shareholder of HSNi (or any representative of a shareholder who has been so designated
in writing) to inspect and copy at HSNi's principal executive offices during regular business hours.

        None of these other joint written and oral preliminary presentations by Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs, alone or together, constitute, or form the basis of, an
opinion of Centerview Partners or Goldman Sachs with respect to the merger consideration. Information contained in these other written and oral preliminary presentations is
substantially similar to the information provided in Centerview Partners' and Goldman Sachs' presentations to the Special Committee (with the other Qualified Directors present)

• The June 22, 2017 materials jointly presented to the Qualified Directors contained, among other information, a review of Liberty Interactive's latest proposal and
an update on the process and the diligence meetings that were held on June 20, 2017.

        The preliminary financial analyses in these other written and oral preliminary presentations were based on market, economic and other conditions as they existed as of the
dates of the respective presentations as well as other information that was available at those times. Accordingly, the results of the financial analyses differed due to changes in
those conditions. Among other things, the results of certain analyses changed as HSNi's financial results changed as well as projections made by management of HSNi were
revised or adjusted. Finally, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs continued to refine various aspects of their respective financial analyses with respect to HSNi and Liberty
Interactive over time.

Position of Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub as to the Fairness of the Merger 

        Each of Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub is expressing its belief as to the fairness of the merger to the unaffiliated HSNi stockholders pursuant to Rule 13e-3 under the
Exchange Act. The Liberty Interactive board and the board of directors of Merger Sub, acting on behalf of Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub, respectively, are making the
statements included in this section solely for the purposes of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and related rules under the Exchange Act. The views of Liberty
Interactive and the Merger Sub should not be construed as a recommendation to any HSNi stockholder as to how that stockholder should vote on the merger agreement proposal.

        Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub sought to negotiate a transaction that would be most favorable to them and did not undertake any independent evaluation of the fairness
of the merger to the unaffiliated HSNi stockholders or engage a financial advisor for such purpose. Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub recognize that the merger is not structured
so that the approval of at least a majority of unaffiliated HSNi stockholders is required. However, based on the appointment of the Special Committee, which consisted entirely of
independent and disinterested directors, by the HSNi board and that committee's broad powers to negotiate the merger agreement and consider alternatives, that the Special
Committee negotiated the material terms of the merger agreement and unanimously recommended its approval by the HSNi board, that the HSNi board unanimously approved
the merger agreement and the factors considered by, and the analysis, discussion, and resulting conclusions of, the HSNi board and the Special Committee described in the
section entitled "—HSNi's Purpose and Reasons for the Merger and Other Proposals; Recommendations of the Special Committee and HSNi Board; Fairness of the Merger"
beginning on page 51 of this proxy statement/prospectus, which analysis, discussion and resulting conclusions Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub expressly adopt as their own,
Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub believe that the merger is substantively and procedurally fair to the unaffiliated HSNi stockholders.

        In their consideration of the fairness of the merger to the unaffiliated HSNi stockholders, Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub considered the current market price of HSNi
common stock as described in the fourteenth bullet on page 50 and the third bullet on page 52 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

        Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub did not consider liquidation value of HSNi to be a relevant methodology because (i) they considered HSNi to be a viable, going concern,
(ii) they believed that liquidation sales generally result in proceeds substantially less than sales of going concerns, (iii) they considered determining a liquidation value to be
impracticable given the significant execution risk involved in any breakup of HSNi and (iv) HSNi will continue to operate its business following the merger.

        Further, Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub did not consider net book value, which is an accounting concept, as a factor because they believed that net book value is not a
material indicator of the value of HSNi as a going concern but rather is indicative of historical costs and because net book

Table of Contents

value does not take into account the prospects of HSNi, market conditions, trends in the industry in which HSNi operates or the business risks inherent in that industry. Liberty
Interactive and Merger Sub did not seek to determine a pre-merger going concern value for HSNi to determine the fairness of the merger to the unaffiliated HSNi stockholders
because, following the merger, HSNi will have a different capital structure, cost profile and operating strategy, among other things. Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub believe
that the trading price of the HSNi common stock at any given time represents the best available indicator of HSNi's going concern value at that time so long as the trading price at
that time is not impacted by speculation regarding the likelihood of a potential transaction. To the extent the pre-merger going concern value was reflected in the market prices of
HSNi common stock prior to the announcement of the merger, the merger consideration represented a premium to the going concern value of HSNi as described in the fourteenth
bullet on page 50 and the third bullet on page 52 of this proxy statement/prospectus.

        Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub did not consider the purchase prices paid by HSNi in previous purchases during the past two years, as they did not consider those prices
to represent the best available indicator of HSNi's pre-merger value but rather to be indicative of historical prices over such two year period, as described below.

        Other than as described in the third bullet on page 53 of this proxy statement/prospectus, Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub did not consider the historical market prices of
HSNi common stock, as they did not consider those prices to represent the best available indicator of HSNi's pre-merger value but rather to be indicative of historical rather than
current value and an implied acquisition premium due to Liberty Interactive being HSNi's largest stockholder. These historical market prices reflect historical industry outlooks
and past expectations regarding HSNi's operating performance, do not reflect current pricing regimes or its current expectations, and have been impacted by market speculation
regarding the timing of a potential acquisition by Liberty Interactive.

        Notwithstanding that the opinions of Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs were provided for the confidential use of the Special Committee, and neither Liberty
Interactive nor Merger Sub are entitled to rely on nor adopt, and neither did rely on nor adopt, such opinions, in making their determination that the merger is substantively and
procedurally fair to the unaffiliated HSNi stockholders, Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub favorably considered the fact that the Special Committee received (i) an opinion from
Centerview Partners, dated July 5, 2017, that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications
and limitations upon the review undertaken by Centerview Partners in preparing its opinion, the merger consideration to be received by the HSNi stockholders (other than as
specified in such opinion) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to such stockholders and (ii) an opinion from Goldman Sachs, dated July 5,
2017, that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the factors and assumptions set forth therein, the exchange ratio to be received by the HSNi stockholders (other than
Liberty Interactive, a significant stockholder of Liberty Interactive, and their respective affiliates) pursuant to the merger agreement was fair from a financial point of view to
such stockholders, each as more fully described below under the heading "—Opinion of the Special Committee Financial Advisor (Centerview Partners)" and "—Opinion of the
Special Committee Financial Advisor (Goldman Sachs)."

        Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub are not aware of any firm offer for a merger, purchase of all or a substantial part of HSNi's assets, or a purchase of a controlling amount
of HSNi common stock having been received by HSNi from anyone other than Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub in the two years preceding the signing of the merger
agreement.

        The foregoing discussion of the factors considered by Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub in connection with the fairness of the merger is not intended to be exhaustive but
includes all material factors considered by Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub in making a determination regarding the

fairness of the merger for the purpose of complying with the requirements of Rule 13e-3 and the related rules under the Exchange Act. Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub did not
find it practicable to, and did not, quantify or otherwise attach relative weights to the foregoing factors in reaching their position as to the fairness of the merger. Rather, Liberty
Interactive and Merger Sub made their fairness determination after considering all of the factors as a whole.

Role of Allen & Co.

        Liberty Interactive formally engaged Allen & Co. to act as its financial advisor with respect to a potential transaction with HSNi on June 21, 2017. Liberty Interactive's
management team selected Allen & Co. based on their global reputation as a premier investment bank with specific sector expertise in Technology, Media and
Telecommunications (TMT) and a strong M&A franchise, coupled with Allen & Co.'s deep understanding of the domestic eCommerce and Home shopping market. Liberty
Interactive has agreed to pay Allen & Co. an aggregate fee of $10 million in connection with the engagement. At the time it retained Allen & Co., Liberty Interactive was aware
that Allen & Co. had recently represented SiriusXM Holdings, Inc., a majority owned subsidiary of Liberty Media Corporation, in connection with its recent investment in
Pandora Media Inc., which further supports Allen & Co.'s strong reputation in the TMT space. Liberty Interactive is a separate publicly traded company from Liberty Media
Corporation and its subsidiary SiriusXM Holdings, Inc., and neither Liberty Interactive nor Liberty Media Corporation considers itself an affiliate of the other. As such, Liberty
Media Corporation had no influence or involvement in the selection of Allen & Co. by Liberty Interactive.

        From time to time during the negotiations described in "—Background of the Merger" (including prior to their official engagement), upon the request by senior management
of Liberty Interactive, representatives of Allen & Co. provided strategic advice and informal analysis to, and consulted with, senior management of Liberty Interactive with
respect to the potential transaction with HSNi. Allen & Co. assisted Liberty Interactive's management team in compiling and analyzing the historical trading price differential
between HSNi and QVC, assessing the pro forma capitalization and implied valuation of the QVC Group at various prices for HSNi and mixes of consideration, assessing the
manner in which Liberty Interactive's various offers split synergy value between HSNi and the QVC Group, and comparing HSNi's 2017 second quarter operating results to sell-
side expectations and management forecasts. Allen & Co. conducted its analysis based only on publicly available data, certain information provided by Liberty Interactive and
certain information provided by HSNi to both Liberty Interactive and Allen & Co. Allen & Co. did not conduct any business diligence independent of that conducted by Liberty
Interactive with respect to HSNi. Such analyses were considered by Liberty Interactive's senior management when preparing its own materials, reports, projections and analyses
with respect to the transaction. In addition, Allen & Co. provided strategic advice with respect to negotiation strategy and specific deal terms set forth in the various drafts of the
transaction documents, and acted as a liaison for Liberty Interactive to the financial advisors engaged by HSNi.

        Allen & Co. engaged with and provided its analyses to senior management of Liberty Interactive only. Representatives of Allen & Co. were not asked to, and did not,
participate in any meeting of the Liberty Interactive board at which a transaction with HSNi was discussed, and otherwise did not prepare or present or submit any analysis,
reports, opinions or materials to the Liberty Interactive board, except to the extent Liberty Interactive's management incorporated certain statistical information provided by
Allen & Co. in management's own analyses presented to the Liberty Interactive board. All analyses, reports, opinions and materials presented to, and relied on by, the Liberty
Interactive board, whether written or oral, were prepared and made by management of Liberty Interactive. Liberty Interactive only engaged, or approached for purposes of
potential engagement, Allen & Co. for such purposes.

        Allen & Co. did not issue an opinion on the fairness to the HSNi stockholders or to the stockholders of Liberty Interactive, from a financial point of view, of the proposed
merger. In addition, Allen & Co. did not provide any other type of report, opinion or appraisal, or otherwise make any finding, within the meaning of Rule 1015 of Regulation M-
A. Allen & Co. did not express any view on, and its analyses did not address, the fairness of the proposed merger to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the
holders of any other securities, creditors or other constituents of HSNi or Liberty Interactive, nor as to the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or
payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of HSNi or Liberty Interactive, or any class of such persons, whether relative to the merger consideration or otherwise.
Other than as described above, Allen & Co. did not express any view relating to the consideration to be offered to the HSNi stockholders. Allen & Co.'s analysis did not
constitute a recommendation to the Liberty Interactive board, any Liberty Interactive stockholder or to any other persons in respect of the proposed merger.

Interests of Certain Persons of HSNi in the Merger 

        In considering the recommendation of the HSNi board with respect to the merger, HSNi stockholders should be aware that executive officers and non-employee directors of
HSNi have certain interests in the merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of HSNi stockholders generally. These interests include the following:

Certain Designated Directors on Boards of HSNi and Liberty Interactive

        The HSNi board includes two designees of Liberty Interactive—Ms. Chun and Mr. Costello. Ms. Chun serves as Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for Liberty
Interactive and Liberty Media Corporation.

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, at the effective time, Liberty Interactive is required (i) to appoint one designee from the HSNi board, who will be chosen in
Liberty Interactive's sole discretion (but who cannot be an HSNi director designated by Liberty Interactive pursuant to the Spinco Agreement), to the Liberty Interactive board at
the effective time, and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to cause such person to be elected to the Liberty Interactive board at the first annual meeting of the stockholders of
Liberty Interactive following the effective time. See "—The Merger Agreement—Additional Covenants and Agreements" and "—Certain Relationships and Related Party
Transactions—Relationship Between HSNi and Liberty Interactive—Spinco Agreement" below.

Indemnification and Insurance

        The merger agreement provides that Liberty Interactive will:

• (i) indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of HSNi in respect of losses, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including
attorney's fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges) in connection with any such
persons having served in such capacity prior to the effective time, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law or any other law or provided under the amended
and restated certificate of incorporation of HSNi (the HSNi charter) or amended and restated bylaws of HSNi (the HSNi bylaws), and (ii) if any such person is a
party to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to matters that would be indemnifiable, advance, and cause HSNi to advance,
fees costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) as incurred by such person in connection with and prior to the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation; 

• cause to be maintained in effect in the surviving corporation's organizational documents regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of
directors, officers and employees and advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended

beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence in HSNi's charter and bylaws on the date of the merger agreement;

• maintain in effect from and after the effective time, in accordance with its terms, each indemnification agreement between HSNi and any present or former officer
or director of HSNi and not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such agreement in any manner that would materially and adversely affect any indemnification
right of such present or former HSNi officer or director; and 

• if HSNi fails to obtain such insurance policies as of the effective time, maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the effective time, the
D&O Insurance in place with HSNi's current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as HSNi's current insurance carrier
with respect to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under HSNi's
existing policies.

Equity Awards

        As described in more detail below under "—The Merger Agreement—Treatment of HSNi Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards in the Merger" at the effective
time, all HSNi equity awards then held by non-employee directors and executive officers (and other employees) will convert into equity awards based on Liberty QVCA common
stock. All such awards that are then unvested will continue to vest following the effective time in accordance with the terms, exercisability, vesting schedules and other
provisions applicable to such awards. The vesting of such awards will accelerate on termination of the holder's employment or service by HSNi without "cause" or by the holder
for "good reason" during the one-year period following the effective time. In the event of such termination, HSNi PSUs will be deemed earned based on the level of attainment of
the applicable relative total stockholder return goal measured as of the date on which the holder's employment or service terminates or the date on which the effective time
occurs, whichever produces the greater payout.

        For the estimated values of the potential accelerated vesting of the equity awards held by HSNi's executive officers on a qualifying termination of employment, see the
"Equity" column of the table below under "—Golden Parachute Compensation."

        The table below sets forth the estimated values of the accelerated vesting of the non-employee directors' deferred stock units, assuming that the effective time had occurred
on November 24, 2017 and that the directors' service was terminated without "cause" immediately thereafter. The values were calculated, in accordance with the applicable rules
under Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act, by assuming a price per share of HSNi common stock of $37.64, which equals the average closing price of a share over the five
business day period following the first public announcement of the merger.

Annual Bonuses

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, each executive officer (and each other bonus-eligible employee) is entitled to the annual bonus opportunities described below if
the executive officer remains employed through the regular payment date or if, following the effective time and prior to such date, the executive officer's employment is
terminated by HSNi without "cause" or by the executive officer for "good reason:"

• Bonus for First Half of 2017.  For the period from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017, the executive officer is eligible for an annual bonus in an amount
determined based on the level of attainment of the applicable performance measures under the applicable bonus plan, measured as of July 5, 2017 against
budgeted performance for such period, as prorated to reflect the number of days during such period. 

• Bonus for Second Half of 2017.  For the period from July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, the executive officer is eligible for an annual bonus in an amount
determined based on the level of attainment of the applicable performance measures under the applicable bonus plan, measured as of December 31, 2017 against
budgeted performance for such period (but in no event less than 70% of the target amount of such bonus), as prorated to reflect the number of days during such
period. 

• Bonus for Pre-Closing Portion of 2018.  If the effective time occurs in 2018, for the period from January 1, 2018 through the effective time (or the last day of the
month immediately preceding the effective time, if the effective time does not occur on the last day of a month), the executive officer is eligible for an annual
bonus in an amount determined based on the level of attainment of the applicable performance measures under the applicable bonus plan, measured as of the
effective time (or such last day of the month) against budgeted performance for such period (but in no event less than 70% of the target amount of such bonus), as
prorated to reflect the number of days during such period.

Performance Cash Awards

        Each named executive officer (other than Ms. Grossman) was granted a performance cash award in 2015 that is scheduled to vest on December 31, 2017 based on the level
of attainment of the applicable relative total shareholder return goal measured over the three-year period ending on such date. Under the terms of the award, if prior to
December 31, 2017 the effective time occurs and the executive's employment is terminated by HSNi without "cause" or by the executive for "good reason," the award will vest
and be paid in cash at the target level, as prorated to reflect the number of months during the performance period that the executive was employed. The amount of the payment
will be reduced to reflect the time value of the earlier payment of the award based on the whole number of months between the first day of the month in which the effective time
occurs and the scheduled vesting date, using the federal short-term rate determined pursuant to Section 1274 of the Code for the month in which the effective time occurs,
compounded monthly. For the estimated values of these payments, see the "Cash" column of the table below under "—Golden Parachute Compensation."

Severance Plan

        Each executive officer participates in the HSN, Inc. Named Executive Officer and Executive Vice President Severance Plan, as amended (the severance plan). The
severance plan was adopted in 2009 to formalize and standardize HSNi's severance practices for its most senior executive officers and was adopted in lieu of issuing new
employment agreements.

        Under the severance plan, each executive officer whose employment is terminated by HSNi without "cause" or by the executive officer for "good reason," in either case
within the one-year period

Table of Contents

following the effective time, would be entitled to the payments and benefits, subject to the conditions and limitations, described below:

• Severance.  A lump sum cash severance payment in an amount equal to the sum of: 

• two times the executive officer's annual base salary in effect on the termination date; plus 

• the executive officer's target annual bonus in effect on the termination date multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from the
first day of the year in which the termination occurs and ending on the second anniversary of the termination date, and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the year in which the termination occurs; plus. 

• an amount equal to HSNi's contribution for medical coverage under HSNi's medical plan for a period of eighteen (18) months. 

• Outplacement Benefits.  Payment or reimbursement of executive outplacement services in an amount not to exceed $20,000. 

• Conditions and Limitations on Payment.  The executive officer's right to these payments and benefits is subject to the following conditions and limitations: 

• The executive officer must sign, and not revoke, a separation and general release agreement waiving all claims against HSNi relating to his or her
employment or separation from employment. 

• The executive officer must comply with all non-competition, non-solicitation, confidential information and proprietary rights or similar restrictive
covenants contained in any agreement to which the executive officer is a party. 

• The executive officer must not have engaged in any conduct that would have constituted "cause" for dismissal. 

• The severance plan provides for a "contingent cutback" relating to the "golden parachute" excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. Pursuant to this
provision, the amount of the severance and any other merger-related payments and benefits that the executive officer otherwise would be entitled to
receive will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid the excise tax, but only if such reduction would result in the executive officer retaining a greater
amount of such payments and benefits on an after-tax basis than had no reduction been made. The amounts set forth in the table below under "—Golden
Parachute Compensation" do not take into account any such reduction.

Table of Contents

Definitions of "Cause" and "Good Reason"

        For purposes of the equity awards, annual bonuses and severance plan, "cause" and "good reason" are defined as follows:

• The term "cause" generally means an executive officer's: 

• willful or gross neglect of his or her duties; 

• plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, or conviction for, the commission of a felony; 

• material breach of a fiduciary duty owed to HSNi; 

• material breach of any non-disclosure, non-solicitation or non-competition obligation owed to HSNi; or 

• for purposes of the severance plan, a violation of any HSNi policy pertaining to ethics, wrongdoing or conflicts of interest. 

• The term "good reason" generally means, without an executive officer's prior written consent: 

• a material reduction in the rate of the executive officer's annual base salary; 

• a relocation of the executive officer's principal place of business by more than 35 miles (for purposes of the equity awards and annual bonuses) or 50 miles
(for purposes of the severance plan); or 

• a material and demonstrable adverse change in the nature and scope of the executive officer's duties. 

• To invoke a termination of employment for "good reason:" 

• the executive officer must provide written notice to HSNi of the existence of a condition described above within 90 days following the executive officer's
knowledge of the initial existence of the condition; 

• HSNi has 30 days following receipt of such written notice to remedy the condition; and 

• if HSNi fails to remedy the condition within such 30-day period, the executive officer must terminate employment within 90 days after the end of such 30-
day period.

Golden Parachute Compensation

        The table below sets forth for each of HSNi's named executive officers estimates of the amounts of compensation that are based on or otherwise relate to the merger and that
will or may become payable to the named executive officer on a qualifying termination of employment following the merger (i.e., on a "double trigger" basis). None of the
named executive officers would be entitled to any such compensation immediately at the effective time (i.e., on a "single trigger" basis). Mindy Grossman, who resigned as
HSNi's Chief Executive Officer effective as of May 24, 2017, would not be entitled to any payments or benefits that are based on or otherwise relate to the merger.

        The HSNi stockholders are being asked to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, such compensation for these named executive officers. See "HSNi Proposals—HSNi
Proposal 3: The Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal." Because the vote to approve such compensation is advisory only, it will not be binding on either HSNi or
Liberty Interactive. Accordingly, if the merger agreement is adopted by HSNi's stockholders and the merger is completed, the compensation will be payable regardless of the
outcome of the vote to approve such compensation, subject only to the conditions applicable thereto, which are described in the footnotes to the table below and above in this
section.

Table of Contents

        The table also sets forth estimates of the amounts of such compensation for Rod R. Little, who is an executive officer of HSNi (but was not a named executive officer for
calendar year 2016 due to his appointment in January 2017).

        The estimates in the table assume that the merger had become effective on November 24, 2017 and that the employment of each of the executive officers (other than
Ms. Grossman) had been terminated immediately thereafter by HSNi without "cause" or by the executive officer for "good reason" (see the definitions above under "—
Definitions of 'Cause' and 'Good Reason"').

from July 1, 2017 through the assumed termination date of November 24, 2017, 70% of the target annual bonus, as prorated to reflect the number of

basis on termination of employment by HSNi without "cause" or by the executive officer for "good reason" on the assumed termination date of
November 24, 2017 (see above under "—Equity Awards"). The amounts in this column reflect the value of such accelerated vesting. The amounts were
calculated, in accordance with the applicable rules under Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act, by assuming a price per share of HSNi common stock
of $37.64, which equals the average closing price of a share over the five business day period following the first public announcement of the merger. 

(3) The amounts in this column reflect outplacement services that each of the executive officers (other than Ms. Grossman) would be entitled to receive on
a "double trigger" basis on termination of employment by HSNi without "cause" or by the executive for "good reason" on the assumed termination date
of November 24, 2017 (see above under "—Severance Plan").

Effect of the Merger on HSNi Stockholders; What HSNi Stockholders Will Receive in the Merger 

        HSNi stockholders (other than Liberty Interactive and its wholly owned subsidiaries) will receive the exchange ratio of 1.650 shares of Liberty QVCA common stock for
each share of HSNi common stock held as of the effective time, which represents approximately $40.36 in shares of Liberty QVCA common stock-based on the closing price of
shares of Liberty QVCA common stock on July 5, 2017, the last trading day before the public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, and $40.95 in shares of
Liberty QVCA common stock, based on the closing price of Liberty QVCA common stock on November 24, 2017, the last practicable date prior to the filing of this proxy
statement/prospectus. Each share of HSNi common stock held by Liberty Interactive or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable share of common stock of the surviving corporation.

        Based upon the number of outstanding shares of HSNi common stock on the HSNi record date, and on the number of shares of capital stock of Liberty Interactive
outstanding on the HSNi record date, it is expected that (i) Liberty Interactive will issue 53.5 million shares of Liberty QVCA common stock in the merger, and (ii) former HSNi
stockholders (excluding Liberty Interactive and any of its wholly owned subsidiaries) will own approximately 11.1% of the undiluted equity of the QVC Group and 7.2% of the
undiluted voting power of the QVC Group. Additionally, HSNi stockholders are expected to own approximately 6.2% of the undiluted voting power of Liberty Interactive as a
whole, taking into account the outstanding shares of the Ventures Group tracking stock as of October 31, 2017. See "Summary—The Companies—Liberty Interactive
Corporation" for a discussion of Liberty Interactive's tracking stock structure.

        Certain rights pertaining to Liberty QVCA common stock to be received by the HSNi stockholders will be different from the rights pertaining to shares of HSNi common
stock. A description of the rights pertaining to Liberty QVCA common stock is included under "Comparison of Stockholders' Rights."

Amount and Source of Funds and Financing of the Merger; Expenses 

        The estimated fees and expenses incurred or expected to be incurred by Liberty Interactive, Merger Sub and HSNi in connection with the merger are as follows:

        The estimate for legal fees set forth in the table above does not include any amounts attributable to any existing or future litigation challenging the merger. Pursuant to the
terms of the merger agreement, each party agreed to pay its own expenses in connection with the merger, except that any expenses incurred by HSNi in connection with the
solicitation of certain consents and amendments to its credit agreement in accordance with the merger agreement are subject to reimbursement by Liberty Interactive upon certain
termination events set forth in the merger agreement.

Accounting Treatment 

        Liberty Interactive will account for the merger under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with GAAP.

Regulatory Approvals 

General

        The parties' respective obligations to consummate the merger are conditioned upon, among other things, (i) the absence of any judgment, order, writ or award entered,
enacted, promulgated, enforced or issued by any court or other governmental authority of competent jurisdiction which prohibits, renders illegal or permanently enjoins the
consummation of the merger, (ii) the expiration or termination of any waiting period applicable to the consummation of the merger under the HSR Act and (iii) the effectiveness
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), of the registration statement on Form S-4 of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, with no stop
order or proceeding seeking a stop order having been initiated by the SEC. In addition, Liberty Interactive's obligation to effect the merger is conditioned upon the approval of the
FCC of applications for transfer of control and/or assignment of certain FCC licenses, authorizations and registrations.

        Liberty Interactive and HSNi have each agreed to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the merger,
including preparing and filing as soon as practicable all applications, forms, registrations and notices required to be filed prior to the consummation of the merger and the taking
of any actions as are reasonably necessary to obtain any requisite approvals, consents, orders, exemptions or waivers from any governmental authority or other third party
required to be obtained prior to the consummation of the merger, including pursuant to the HSR Act, FCC requirements or as required in relation to any antitrust, trade,
competition, or other regulatory matters. Liberty Interactive and HSNi have also agreed to take all reasonable actions necessary to resolve any objection asserted under any
domestic or foreign competition or antitrust law or any communications law, or any action asserted by any governmental authority objecting to the merger. However, neither
Liberty Interactive nor HSNi will be obligated to, consent to or agree to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change, its respective assets or
business in any manner that, individually or in the aggregate, (i) materially adversely affects the financial condition, business or operations of (x) HSNi and its subsidiaries or
(y) QVC and zulily, and their respective subsidiaries, on a consolidated and post-closing basis, or (ii) prohibits or materially limits the ownership, control or operation by
(x) HSNi and its subsidiaries or (y) QVC and zulily, and their respective subsidiaries, of any material portion of its or their respective businesses or assets, or compels Liberty
Interactive (with respect to the QVC Group only) or HSNi to dispose of or hold separate any material portion of its business or assets.

        There can be no assurances that all of the regulatory approvals necessary to consummate the merger and described herein will be obtained and, if obtained, there can be no
assurances as to the timing of any approvals, Liberty Interactive's and HSNi's ability to obtain the approvals on satisfactory terms or the absence of any litigation challenging
such approvals. For more information, see "Risk Factors" below.

Securities and Exchange Commission

        In connection with the issuance of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock in the merger, Liberty Interactive must file a registration statement with the SEC under the
Securities Act, of which this proxy statement/prospectus forms a part, and it is a condition to the merger that such registration statement has become effective under the Securities
Act, and that no stop order has been issued or initiated by the SEC and not rescinded.

Federal Communications Commission

        HSNi, through multiple subsidiaries, holds satellite earth station authorizations, low-power television licenses, and business radio licenses issued by the FCC, the transfer of
control of which requires the prior approval of the FCC. On July 18, 2017, the parties filed applications seeking the FCC's consent to transfer control of the FCC licenses and
authorizations in connection with the merger, and no petitions to deny were filed. On July 26, 2017, the FCC consented to the transfer of the business radio licenses. On
September 14, 2017, the FCC granted the application for transfer of control of the satellite earth station authorizations. On September 18, 2017, the FCC granted the application
for transfer of control of the low-power television licenses. Television broadcast licensees must consummate an FCC-approved transfer of control within 90 days of public notice
of approval, unless a request for an extension of time to consummate is filed prior to the expiration of this period. To finalize the transaction, the parties will seek a 90-day
extension of their application for transfer of control of HSNi's low-power television licenses. The FCC routinely grants such requests for extension.

HSR Act

        The merger is subject to the requirements of the HSR Act, which provides that certain transactions may not be completed until required information and materials are
furnished to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the DOJ), and the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC), and until certain waiting period requirements have
been satisfied. Each of HSNi and Liberty Interactive filed a Pre-merger Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the DOJ and the FTC in connection with the
merger effective July 28, 2017. The waiting period expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on August 28, 2017.

        The DOJ, the FTC, state attorneys general, and others may challenge the merger on antitrust grounds after the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period.
Accordingly, at any time before or after the completion of the merger, any of the DOJ, the FTC or others could take action under the antitrust laws, including without limitation
seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or permitting completion subject to regulatory concessions or conditions. Neither HSNi nor Liberty Interactive believes that the
merger violates U.S. antitrust laws, but there can be no assurance that a challenge to the merger on antitrust grounds will not be made or, if such a challenge is made, that it would
not be successful.

No Appraisal Rights 

        In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, HSNi stockholders will not have appraisal rights in connection with the merger.

carefully and in its entirety before making any decisions regarding the merger agreement and the merger.

        This summary of the merger agreement is included in this proxy statement/prospectus only to provide you with information regarding the terms and conditions of the merger

or businesses. Accordingly, the representations and warranties and other provisions of the merger agreement should not be read alone, but instead should be read together with
the information provided elsewhere in this proxy statement/prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. For more
information, see "Additional Information—Where You Can Find More Information."

        The representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the merger agreement and described in this proxy statement/prospectus were made only for purposes of the merger
agreement, were made as of specific dates and may be subject to more recent developments, were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the merger agreement and may be
subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by reference to confidential disclosures, were made for the purposes of allocating
contractual risk between the parties to the merger agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may apply standards of materiality in a way that is different from
what may be viewed as material by you or other investors. The representations and warranties set forth in the merger agreement do not, with certain exceptions, survive the
effective time of the merger. Investors should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any description thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts
or conditions of Liberty Interactive, HSNi or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates, but instead should be read together with the information provided elsewhere in this
proxy statement/prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference into this proxy statement/prospectus. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in the merger agreement may change after the date of the merger agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be
fully reflected in public disclosures by Liberty Interactive or HSNi.

Form of the Merger

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, at the effective time, Merger Sub will merge with and into HSNi, with HSNi continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a
wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive.

Consideration to HSNi Stockholders in the Merger

        HSNi stockholders (other than Liberty Interactive and its wholly owned subsidiaries) will receive the exchange ratio of 1.650 shares of Liberty QVCA common stock for
each share of HSNi common stock held as of the effective time, which represents approximately $40.36 in shares of Liberty QVCA common stock based on the closing price of
shares of Liberty QVCA common stock on July 5, 2017, the last trading day before the public announcement of the execution of the merger agreement, and $40.95 in shares of
Liberty QVCA common stock based on the closing price of Liberty QVCA common stock on November 24, 2017, the last practicable date prior to the filing of this proxy
statement/prospectus. Each share of HSNi common stock held by Liberty Interactive or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable share of common stock of the surviving corporation.

        No fractional shares of Liberty QVCA common stock will be issued in the merger. To the extent that the merger would result in any HSNi stockholder being issued a
fractional share, such HSNi stockholder will instead receive a cash payment in an amount based on the aggregation and sale of all fractional shares by the exchange agent at
prevailing market prices on behalf of such HSNi stockholders. Amounts payable in lieu of such fractional shares will be payable from the proceeds of the aggregation and sale of
the fractional shares as soon as practicable following the effective time. No HSNi stockholder will be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights with respect to any
fractional shares.

        Certain rights pertaining to Liberty QVCA common stock to be received by the HSNi stockholders will be different from the rights pertaining to shares of HSNi common
stock. A description of the rights pertaining to Liberty QVCA common stock is included under "Comparison of Stockholders' Rights."

Treatment of HSNi Stock Options and Other Equity-Based Awards in the Merger

        At the effective time of the merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, outstanding equity awards with respect to shares of HSNi common
stock granted by HSNi to employees and non-employee directors will be adjusted as follows:

• Stock Options.  At the effective time, each HSNi stock option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested, will be
converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock (rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares) equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of HSNi common stock subject to such HSNi stock option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and (ii) the
exchange ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share, at an exercise price per share determined by dividing the per-share exercise price of the HSNi stock
option immediately prior to the effective time of the merger by the exchange ratio (rounding the resulting quotient up to the nearest whole cent). Any restrictions
applicable to the exercise of the HSNi stock options will continue in full force and effect following such adjustment and the terms, exercisability, vesting
schedules and other provisions will remain unchanged. 

• Stock Appreciation Rights.  At the effective time, each HSNi SAR that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time, whether vested or unvested,
will be converted into a stock appreciation right with respect to a number of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of HSNi common stock subject to such HSNi SAR immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and (ii) the exchange ratio, rounded down to the
nearest whole share, at an exercise price per share determined by dividing the exercise price of such HSNi SAR immediately prior to the effective time by the
exchange ratio (rounding the resulting quotient up to the nearest whole cent). Any restrictions applicable to the exercise of the HSNi SARs will continue in full
force and effect following such adjustment and the terms, exercisability, vesting schedules and other provisions will remain unchanged. 

• Restricted Stock Units.  At the effective time, each HSNi RSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, that is subject to
time-based vesting, will be converted into an award of restricted stock units with respect to a number of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of HSNi common stock subject to such HSNi RSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and (ii) the exchange
ratio, rounded to the nearest whole share. Any vesting conditions and restrictions on the receipt of any HSNi RSUs will continue in full force and effect following
such adjustment and the terms, vesting schedules and other provisions will remain unchanged. 

• Performance Share Units.  At the effective time, each HSNi PSU that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will be converted
into an award of performance share units with respect to a target number of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock equal to the product of (i) the target number
of shares of HSNi common stock subject to such HSNi PSU immediately prior to the effective time of the merger and (ii) the exchange ratio, rounded to the
nearest whole share. Any vesting conditions and restrictions on the receipt of any HSNi PSUs will continue in full force and effect following such adjustment and
the terms, vesting schedules and other provisions will remain unchanged.

Table of Contents

        Each adjusted HSNi stock option, HSNi SAR, HSNi RSU and HSNi PSU will be subject to further adjustment to reflect any stock split, division, consolidation,
reclassification, recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to shares of Liberty QVCA common stock. In addition, each adjusted HSNi stock option, HSNi SAR, HSNi
RSU and HSNi PSU will be subject to the authority of the compensation committee of the Liberty Interactive board and Liberty Interactive's equity compensation administrative
procedures.

Closing: Effective Time of the Merger

        Unless the merger agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms, and subject to certain other conditions set forth in the merger agreement, the closing of
the merger will occur as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the second business day) after all of the conditions to the merger have been satisfied or waived by the
party entitled to the benefit of the same (other than the conditions which by their terms are required to be satisfied or waived at the closing of the merger, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) (the date on which the closing occurs, or at such other time and on a date as agreed to by the parties in writing, the closing date).

        The merger will become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date and time as Liberty
Interactive and HSNi may agree and as is set forth in such Certificate of Merger.

Organizational Documents

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, at the effective time, the HSNi charter will be amended and restated in the merger until thereafter further amended and restated as
provided therein and in accordance with the DGCL. In addition, at the effective time, the HSNi bylaws will be amended and restated in the merger until thereafter further
amended and restated as provided therein and in accordance with surviving corporation's certificate of incorporation and the DGCL.

Directors and Management Following the Merger

        Subject to applicable law, the directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the effective time will be the directors of the surviving corporation from and after the
effective time and will hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement, resignation or removal. The
officers of HSNi as of immediately prior to the effective time will be the officers of the surviving corporation from and after the effective time and will hold office until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or their earlier death, incapacitation, retirement, resignation or removal.

Exchange of Shares in the Merger

        Liberty Interactive has selected its transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as the exchange agent for the purpose of exchanging shares (whether certificated or
in non-certificated book-entry form) for the merger consideration and will enter into an exchange agent agreement with the exchange agent setting forth the duties,
responsibilities and obligations of the exchange agent consistent with the terms of the merger agreement.

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, Liberty Interactive will make available to the exchange agent, at or prior to the effective time, a number of shares of Liberty QVCA
common stock sufficient to pay the merger consideration. Promptly after the effective time, Liberty Interactive will, or will cause the exchange agent to, if a stockholder held
certificates representing shares of HSNi common stock (other than shares held by Liberty Interactive or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries) immediately prior to the effective
time, send such holder a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging each of their certificated shares of HSNi common stock for the merger consideration. Holders of
shares of HSNi

common stock in book-entry form (other than shares held by Liberty Interactive or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries) immediately prior to the effective time will have the
exchange of such shares effected in accordance with Liberty Interactive's customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry.

        Upon surrender of certificates for cancellation along with the properly completed letter of transmittal, or compliance with customary procedures with respect to the exchange
of shares in book-entry form, as the case may be, each holder of shares of HSNi common stock that have been converted into a right to receive the merger consideration will be
entitled to receive (i) the number of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock in non-certificated book entry form that such holder has a right to receive pursuant to the merger
agreement, (ii) a check in the amount equal to the cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares following the aggregation and sale thereof, and (iii) any dividends or distributions
with respect to such shares of Liberty QVCA common stock with a record date following the effective time and a payment time on or prior to the date of the surrender of
certificate or transfer of book-entry shares, as applicable. The surrendered certificates will be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any merger consideration or any
unpaid dividends or other distributions.

        The above procedures are subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, including those relating to the endorsement of certificates, procedures relating to lost,
stolen or destroyed certificates and the termination of the exchange fund.

        The merger agreement contains a number of representations and warranties made by each of Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and HSNi, on the other
hand, solely for the benefit of each other. These representations and warranties are subject in some cases to certain exceptions, qualifications and limitations, including, among
other things, as to materiality and to material adverse effects. In addition, several of the representations and warranties made by Liberty Interactive and Merger Sub were made
solely with respect to the QVC Group (and the subsidiaries and equity affiliates attributed thereto other than HSNi).

• tax matters; 

• existence and validity of certain material contracts; 

• employee matters; 

• payments of broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fees in connection with the merger; and

        The merger agreement also contains representations of HSNi relating to, among other things, real property, intellectual property, IT systems and data security, environmental
matters, insurance, anti-takeover statutes, stockholder rights plans and the rights plan amendment and receipt of certain opinions with respect to the merger consideration to be
received by the HSNi stockholders (other than Liberty Interactive or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries).

Definition of "Material Adverse Effect"

        Certain of the representations and warranties made by each of Liberty Interactive and HSNi are qualified by a "material adverse effect" standard (that is, they will not be
deemed to be untrue or incorrect unless their failure to be true or correct has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on such party and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

        Under the terms of the merger agreement, a "material adverse effect" means a material adverse effect (i) on the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or
financial condition of the applicable party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) that prevents, impairs or delays the ability of the applicable party to perform its obligations
under the merger agreement or to consummate the merger by the outside date (or would reasonably be expected to do so). However, none of the following changes or events will
be deemed to constitute, or taken into account when determining the occurrence of, a material adverse effect with respect to either Liberty Interactive or HSNi:

• general economic, political, regulatory, legal or tax conditions, including financial or credit markets, or changes therein (including changes in prevailing interest
rates, credit availability and liquidity, currency exchange rates, price levels or trading volumes in the United States or foreign securities markets); 

• geopolitical conditions or changes therein (including any changes arising out of acts of terrorism or war, sabotage, cyber attacks, weather conditions or other force
majeure events); 

• financial or security market fluctuations or conditions; 

• changes in, or events affecting, the industries in which the applicable party or any of its respective subsidiaries operate; 

• any effect arising out of a change or proposed change in GAAP or applicable law or any authoritative interpretation thereof; 

• (i) the execution of the merger agreement or the announcement, pendency or consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including
the merger, (ii) any actions taken by a party that are required or expressly contemplated by the merger agreement, including any actions required under the merger
agreement to obtain any approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations or other confirmations under law, (iii) any actions taken by a party with the
express written consent of the other party that are otherwise expressly

prohibited by the merger, or (iv) any actions omitted to be taken by a party that are expressly prohibited by the merger agreement, if such party has requested the
consent of the other party to take such action and such other party unreasonably withholds its consent thereto (provided that for certain limited purposes specified
in the merger agreement, the foregoing may be taken into account in determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred); or

• any changes in the price or trading volume of the capital stock of a party (provided that the events, occurrences, facts, conditions, changes, developments or
effects giving rise to or contributing to such change may, to the extent not otherwise excluded from the definition of "material adverse effect," be taken into
account).

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, any event, occurrence, fact, condition, change development or effect listed in the first five bullets above which disproportionately affects the
applicable party and its respective subsidiaries relative to other participants in the industries in which such party and its subsidiaries operate will not be excluded from
determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred with respect to such party, but only to the extent such event occurrence, fact, condition, change, development or effect
so disproportionately affects such party and its subsidiaries.

        In addition, with respect to HSNi, when determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred, the following will not be taken into account in determining whether a
material adverse effect has occurred:

• any revocation or modification by the FCC of any low-power television broadcast or satellite earth station license of HSNi, except to the extent attributable to
HSNi's failure to operate in compliance with the terms of HSNi's FCC licenses and the Communications Act; 

• any claim, suit, proceeding, action, arbitration, mediation or investigation by or before any governmental authority arising out of, resulting from or related to the
transactions contemplated by the merger agreement; or 

• any failure by HSNi or any of its subsidiaries to meet published or unpublished revenue or earning budgets, forecasts or projections (provided that the events,
occurrences, facts, conditions, changes, developments or effects giving rise to or contributing to such failure may be taken into account in determining whether a
material adverse effect has occurred).

        In addition, with respect to Liberty Interactive, when determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred, any event or occurrence required or contemplated by, or
necessary to consummate, the GCI transactions will not be taken into account in determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred.

        Furthermore, with respect to Liberty Interactive, when determining whether a material adverse effect has occurred, such determination will be made only with respect to the
QVC Group, taken as a whole (and the subsidiaries and equity affiliates attributed thereto other than HSNi).

Conduct of HSNi Pending the Merger

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time, except (x) as expressly required or contemplated by the
merger agreement or any contract in effect as of the date of the merger agreement, (y) as consented to in writing by Liberty Interactive, or (z) for certain specified exceptions,
HSNi has agreed that it will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, (i) conduct its business in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, and (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to preserve intact its business organization and goodwill and relationships with material customers, suppliers, licensors, licensees, distributors and other

solicitation, deliver (or cause to be delivered), a written consent with respect to all of the shares of HSNi common stock beneficially owned or owned of record by Liberty
Interactive or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates as of the applicable record date (the subject securities): (i) in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement and the approval of
the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, and any related proposals in furtherance of the merger, (ii) in favor of any proposal to adjourn or
postpone any such meeting to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement and/or if there are not sufficient shares present in person or by proxy at
such meeting to constitute a quorum, and (iii) in favor of any other matter necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.

        In addition, Liberty Interactive has agreed to revoke all previous proxies granted with respect to the subject securities. If Liberty Interactive fails to satisfy its obligations
under the merger agreement, it will irrevocably grant to and appoint HSNi as Liberty Interactive's proxy and attorney-in-fact to (i) represent the subject securities, and (ii) vote,
execute written consents and otherwise act with respect to the subject securities regarding certain matters until the effective time. Any such proxy granted will be irrevocable and
coupled with an interest and revoke any proxy previously granted by Liberty Interactive with respect to the subject securities. Such proxy will be automatically revoked at the
effective time.

        Liberty Interactive has also agreed that, prior to the approval of the merger agreement proposal by the HSNi stockholders, it will not, and will not permit any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates to (i) transfer, assign, sell, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of (whether by merger, by tendering into any tender or exchange offer, by
testamentary disposition, by operation of law or otherwise) or consent to any of the foregoing, or cause to be transferred, any of the subject securities, (ii) grant any proxies or
powers of attorney, or any other authorization or consent with respect to any or all of its subject securities in respect of any matter addressed by the merger agreement,

power of attorney with respect thereto that is inconsistent with the merger agreement, (iv) enter into any contract with respect to the transfer of any subject securities, or (v) take
any other action, that would restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of Liberty Interactive's obligations under the merger agreement. Any transfer of the subject securities
that violates the merger agreement will be null and void.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, Liberty Interactive will be able to enter into bona fide loan, borrowing or other transactions used to finance, or refinance, the
acquisition or holding by Liberty Interactive of any of the subject securities that could not result in it ceasing to have the power to vote the subject securities and does not have
the effect of hedging Liberty Interactive's exposure to change in the price of the subject securities (a financing transaction) in respect of the subject securities and any payment
or settlement thereunder, the granting of any lien, pledge, security interest, or other encumbrance in or on such subject securities to any financial institution acting as a lender,
secured party or other counterparty (a financing counterparty) in connection with any financing transaction, the rehypothecation of any subject securities by the financing

No Solicitation

        Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, HSNi has agreed to, and to cause its subsidiaries and the directors, officers and employees and representatives of HSNi and
its subsidiaries to, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective advisors, agents and other representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third party with respect to any alternative transaction proposal. In addition, HSNi has further agreed not to, and to cause
its subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers and employees not to, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective advisors, agents and other
representatives not to:

• solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate (including by furnishing information), induce or encourage any inquiries, offers or proposals that constitute or would
reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative transaction proposal (as described below); or 

• enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish any information to any third party with respect to, or cooperate
in any way that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an alternative transaction proposal.

        An alternative transaction proposal means any offer, inquiry, proposal or indication of interest, written or oral (other than from Liberty Interactive or an affiliate of Liberty
Interactive) relating to any of the following transactions: (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, liquidation or similar transaction
involving HSNi which would result in any third party owning 10% or more of the aggregate outstanding voting securities of HSNi, (ii) any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase, by any third party or group of third parties, whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, including by means of the acquisition of capital stock of
any subsidiary of HSNi, of assets or properties that constitute 10% or more of the fair market value of the assets and properties of HSNi and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
(iii) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions, of 10% or more of the aggregate outstanding equity securities
or voting power of HSNi, or (iv) any other transaction having a similar effect to those described in any of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), in each case, other than the transactions
contemplated by the merger agreement.

        HSNi has agreed to notify Liberty Interactive within 24 hours of the receipt of an alternative transaction proposal, including a written summary of the material terms and
conditions thereof. In the event that HSNi receives, after the date of the merger agreement and prior to obtaining the necessary stockholder approval, a bona fide written
alternative transaction proposal which (i) did not result from a breach by HSNi of its non-solicitation obligations, and (ii) the HSNi board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor) to be, or to be reasonably expected to lead to, a superior transaction proposal (as described below), and that the
failure to take certain actions with respect to such alternative transaction proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law,
HSNi may take the following actions:

• engage in negotiations with, furnish any information with respect to HSNi and its subsidiaries to, and afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of HSNi and its subsidiaries to, the third party making such alternative transaction proposal (provided that (i) prior to furnishing any such information,
HSNi enters into a confidentiality agreement containing terms and restrictions, including a standstill provision, that are customary for confidentiality agreements
executed in similar circumstances, and (ii) HSNi furnishes Liberty Interactive with any material non-public information concerning HSNi that HSNi provides to
such third parties (to the extent not previously made available to Liberty Interactive); and 

• engage in further discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to such alternative transaction proposal.

Table of Contents

        A superior transaction proposal means a bona fide written alternative transaction proposal which the HSNi board determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Special Committee and its outside legal counsel and financial advisor), taking into account all legal, financial, tax, regulatory timing and other aspects, (i) is reasonably likely to
be consummated, (ii) to the extent financing is required, such financing is then fully committed or reasonably capable of being obtained, (iii) is more favorable from a financial
point of view to the HSNi stockholders (other than Liberty Interactive and its wholly owned subsidiaries) as compared to the merger, and (iv) is otherwise on other terms superior
to those of the merger. However, under the terms of the merger agreement, no alternative transaction proposal can constitute a superior transaction proposal unless each reference
to "10%" in the definition of "alternative transaction proposal" is replaced with a reference to "60%."

        Notwithstanding the above restrictions, HSNi and its representatives are permitted to seek to clarify the terms and conditions of any inquiry or proposal to determine
whether it constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a superior transaction proposal and are permitted to inform third parties making an alternative transaction
proposal of the restrictions imposed by the "no shop" and "non-solicitation" provisions of the merger agreement.

Board Recommendation and Adverse Recommendation Change

        Pursuant to the merger agreement, the HSNi board has agreed not to, directly or indirectly, (i) withdraw (or qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Liberty
Interactive) or publicly propose to withdraw (or qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Liberty Interactive) its recommendation in favor of the merger, (ii) recommend,
adopt or approve (or publicly propose to recommend, adopt or approve) any alternative transaction proposal, (iii) make a public recommendation in connection with a tender
offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act, (iv) fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer by the close of business on the 10th business day after the commencement of such tender offer or
exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, or (v) other than with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer, fail to publicly reaffirm its approval or
recommendation of the merger agreement within five business days after Liberty Interactive so requests if any alternative transaction proposal has been made publicly or sent to
the HSNi stockholders (any of the foregoing actions being an adverse recommendation change). In addition, HSNi has agreed not to approve or recommend, or execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other agreement constituting or relating to an alternative transaction proposal or requiring it to abandon,
terminate or otherwise fail to consummate the merger.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the HSNi board may make an adverse recommendation change in response to an intervening event (as described below) or a superior
transaction proposal or, solely in response to a superior transaction proposal, terminate the merger agreement in order to enter concurrently into a definitive agreement with
respect to a superior transaction proposal, if in either case the HSNi board determines in good faith after consultation with the Special Committee and its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, that the failure to take such action would be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, but only if:

• HSNi has provided to Liberty Interactive four business days prior written notice expressly stating (i) that it has received a superior transaction proposal or that
there has been an intervening event, (ii) in the case of a superior transaction proposal, the material terms and conditions of such superior transaction proposal and
copies of the proposed transaction documents with respect thereto, and (iii) that it intends to make an adverse recommendation change, or in the case of a superior
transaction proposal, terminate the merger agreement;

• prior to making an adverse recommendation change or terminating the merger agreement, HSNi has negotiated in good faith with Liberty Interactive to amend the
merger agreement, and considered in good faith any bona fide counteroffer by Liberty Interactive; and 

• following such good faith negotiations (to the extent requested by Liberty Interactive), HSNi again determines, after consultation with the Special Committee and
its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that the failure to make an adverse recommendation change or terminate the merger agreement would be likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.

        In the event that any amendment is made to any material term of the superior transaction proposal, HSNi will provide a new notice to Liberty Interactive in accordance with
the first bullet above and HSNi will again negotiate in good faith with Liberty Interactive (to the extent requested by Liberty Interactive), provided that such negotiation period
for an amendment to a superior transaction proposal will be three business days.

        An intervening event means any event, fact, condition, change, occurrence, development or effect that was not known or reasonably foreseeable (or the material
consequences of which (or the magnitude of which) were not known or reasonably foreseeable) to the HSNi board as of the date of the merger agreement, did not result from a
breach by HSNi of the merger agreement and does not relate to or involve an alternative transaction proposal, excluding (i) any changes in the price or trading volume of capital
stock of HSNi or Liberty QVCA common stock, and (ii) HSNi failing to meet or exceeding revenue or earnings projections.

Indemnification and Insurance

        The merger agreement provides that, for six years after the effective time, Liberty Interactive will indemnify and hold harmless present and former directors, officers,
employees or agents of HSNi or its subsidiaries, and any individuals serving in such capacity (the Indemnified Persons) from and against all liabilities, losses, damages, costs,
expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges) in connection with any
action based on or arising out of such persons having served in such capacity prior to the effective time, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law or any other law or
provided under the HSNi charter and HSNi bylaws. If any such person is a party to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to matters that
would be indemnifiable, Liberty Interactive shall, and shall cause HSNi to, advance fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) as incurred by such
person in connection with and prior to the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. For six years after the effective time, Liberty Interactive will
cause HSNi to maintain in HSNi's organizational documents provisions regarding the elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of directors, officers, employees,
fiduciaries and agents and advancement of fees, costs and expenses no less advantageous to such individuals as those set forth in HSNi's organization documents as of the date of
the merger agreement.

        The merger agreement further provides that, for a period of six years after the effective time, Liberty Interactive will cause HSNi to obtain and fully pay the premium for the
non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers' liability coverage of HSNi's existing directors' and officers' insurance policies and HSNi's existing fiduciary liability
insurance policies (D&O Insurance). If HSNi fails to obtain such insurance policies as of the effective time, HSNi shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six
years from and after the effective time, the D&O Insurance in place with HSNi's current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
HSNi's current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided
under HSNi's existing policies, or following the closing of the merger HSNi will purchase from HSNi's current insurance

carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as HSNi's current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance comparable D&O Insurance for such
six year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided in HSNi's existing policies; provided that in no event shall
Liberty Interactive or HSNi be required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the premium amount per annum for HSNi's existing
policies.

        The merger agreement further provides that Liberty Interactive will cause HSNi and its subsidiaries to honor and comply with their respective obligations under any
indemnification agreement with any Indemnified Person and will not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such agreement in any manner that would adversely affect any
indemnification right of any Indemnified Person.

Employee Benefits Matters

        For a period of one (1) year following the date of the effective time, Liberty Interactive shall provide each employee of HSNi and its subsidiaries (as long as he or she is
employed immediately prior to the effective time) (i) an annual rate of salary, wages and/or commissions that is no less favorable than that provided to such employee as of
immediately prior to the effective time, (ii) incentive compensation opportunities (including annual incentives, equity-based incentives and other performance-based
compensation) and employee benefits (other than severance) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the incentive compensation opportunities and employee
benefits (other than severance) provided to such employee during applicable periods prior to the effective time (provided that Liberty Interactive may provide cash incentives of
substantially comparable value in lieu of equity-based incentives), and (iii) severance protections and benefits no less favorable than those provided to such employee as of
immediately prior to the effective time.

        For a discussion of the provisions related to annual bonuses under the merger agreement, see above under "—Interests of Certain Persons of HSNi in the Merger—Annual
Bonuses."

        With respect to health and welfare plans, Liberty Interactive shall (i) waive preexisting conditions and other limitations and waiting periods with respect to coverage of the
employees of HSNi and its subsidiaries (as long as they are employed immediately prior to the effective time) and (ii) recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles
and similar expenses incurred by the employees of HSNi and its subsidiaries (as long as they are employed immediately prior to the effective time) during the calendar year of
the effective time for the purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment limitations. Additionally, Liberty Interactive shall provide each employee of HSNi and its
subsidiaries (as long as such employee is employed immediately prior to the effective time) with full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting, accruals and determination of level
of benefits under any employee benefit or compensation plan or arrangement maintained by Liberty Interactive or any of its affiliates that such employee may be eligible to
participate in after the effective time for such employee's service with HSNi or any of its subsidiaries, to the same extent that such service was credited for purposes of any
comparable HSNi benefit plan immediately prior to the effective time; provided, however, that such credit will not be required if it would result in (A) duplication of benefits,
(B) service credit for benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan, or (C) service credit under a newly established plan for which prior service is not taken into account
for employees of Liberty Interactive generally.

        Nothing in the merger agreement limits Liberty Interactive's right to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any specific employee benefit plan that Liberty Interactive would
otherwise have under the terms of such plan, or will give any individual a right to continued employment following the effective time.

• by either Liberty Interactive or HSNi, if the required approval of the HSNi stockholders is not obtained at the HSNi special meeting (or at any adjournment or
postponement thereof).

        The merger agreement may also be terminated by Liberty Interactive:

• if the HSNi board makes an adverse recommendation change, or HSNi materially breaches or fails to perform its non-solicitation obligations and such breach or
failure to perform results in, or leads to, an alternative transaction proposal, in either case, if the required approval of the HSNi stockholders has not yet been
obtained; or 

• if, provided that Liberty Interactive is not in material breach of any of its obligations, there is any continuing inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of
HSNi, or HSNi is materially failing to perform any of its covenants or other agreements set forth in the merger agreement, in any case, that would result in the
failure of a closing condition to be satisfied (subject to a cure period of 60 days).

        The merger agreement may also be terminated by HSNi:

• in order for HSNi to enter concurrently into a definitive written agreement with respect to a superior transaction proposal if the required approval of the HSNi
stockholders has not yet been obtained; or 

• provided that HSNi is not in material breach of any of its obligations, if there is any continuing inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of Liberty
Interactive or Merger Sub, or Liberty Interactive or Merger Sub is materially failing to perform any of its covenants or other agreements set forth in the merger
agreement, in any case, that would result in the failure of a closing condition to be satisfied (subject to a cure period of 60 days).

Effect of Termination

        In the event that the merger agreement is terminated, it will become null and void and have no effect and the obligations of Liberty Interactive and HSNi thereunder will
terminate, except for provisions relating to anti-takeover statutes, confidentiality obligations, indemnification, reimbursement of financing fees and payments, as well as specified
general provisions, each of which will survive termination. If such termination results from (i) the intentional failure of any party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the
obligations of the other party, or (ii) the willful material breach of the merger agreement by any party, such party will be fully liable for any and all damages that are the natural,
probable and reasonably foreseeable result of the event giving rise thereto (which will not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include the
benefit of the bargain lost by such party's stockholders) incurred or suffered by the other party. Liberty Interactive

and HSNi each agreed that the parties will be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to seek specific enforcement of the
terms and provisions of the merger agreement as described below. The termination of the merger agreement will not affect the terms of the confidentiality agreement between
Liberty Interactive and HSNi, which will survive termination of the merger agreement.

Termination Fees

        The merger agreement requires HSNi to pay Liberty Interactive a one-time termination fee of $40 million if (i) HSNi terminates the merger agreement prior to the receipt of
the required HSNi stockholder approval to enter concurrently into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior transaction proposal, (ii) Liberty Interactive terminates the
merger agreement prior to the receipt of the required HSNi stockholder approval as a result of (x) HSNi materially breaching or failing to perform its non-solicitation obligations
and such breach or failure to perform leads to or results in an alternative transaction proposal, or (y) the HSNi board making an adverse recommendation change, or (iii)(A) an
alternative transaction proposal is made to HSNi, (B) the merger agreement is thereafter terminated (1) by either party because the merger was not consummated on or before the
outside date, (2) by either party following the failure of the HSNi stockholders to approve the merger agreement proposal at the HSNi special meeting or (3) by Liberty
Interactive if HSNi commits a breach of any covenant that results in the failure of the related closing condition to be satisfied (subject to a cure period in certain circumstances),
and (C) within fifteen (15) months of the date of such termination, HSNi enters into an agreement with respect to an alternative transaction, and such alternative transaction is
subsequently consummated.

        The merger agreement requires Liberty Interactive to pay HSNi a one-time termination fee of $75 million if HSNi or Liberty Interactive terminates the merger agreement
(i) in the event that the merger has not been consummated by the outside date (as it may be extended) as a result of the required regulatory approvals having not been obtained, or
(ii) if any governmental authority issues or grants an order or takes any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the merger and such order or
action is final and non-appealable.

Specific Performance

        The merger agreement provides that the parties are entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the merger agreement and to seek to enforce
specifically its terms and provisions in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

        However, in no event will HSNi or the HSNi stockholders be permitted or entitled to seek a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief to consummate the merger
unless (i) all of the conditions to the obligations of both parties and the conditions to the obligations of HSNi are satisfied (or capable of being satisfied at the closing and those
conditions that Liberty Interactive's or Merger Sub's breach of the merger agreement has caused not to be satisfied) or waived, and (ii) HSNi has confirmed in writing that it is
ready, willing and able to consummate the merger.

The Rights Plan Amendment 

        In connection with the merger agreement, on July 5, 2017, HSNi and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as successor-in-interest to The Bank of New York Mellon, a
New York banking corporation, entered into the rights plan amendment with respect to the HSNi rights plan.

        Pursuant to the rights plan amendment, neither the approval, execution, delivery or performance of the merger agreement or the other contracts or instruments related
thereto, nor the announcement or the consummation of the merger, will (i) cause the HSNi rights to acquire shares of HSNi common

stock to become exercisable, (ii) cause Liberty Interactive, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates or associates to become an Acquiring Person (as defined in the HSNi rights plan)
or (iii) give rise to a Stock Acquisition Date (as defined in the HSNi rights plan), Distribution Date (as defined in the HSNi rights plan) or Triggering Event (as defined in the
HSNi rights plan). The rights plan amendment also provides that the HSNi rights will expire in their entirety, and the HSNi rights plan will terminate, immediately prior to the
effective time (but only if the effective time occurs) without any consideration payable therefor or in respect thereof.

Plans for HSNi After the Merger 

        Following the consummation of the merger, it is anticipated that HSNi will continue to conduct its operations and business substantially as they are currently being
conducted, except that HSNi will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive and integrated into the QVC Group. In accordance with the merger agreement, the HSNi
common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and deregistered under the Exchange Act. The deregistration of the HSNi common stock under the Exchange Act would suspend
HSNi's obligation to file reports under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

        As of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, other than the merger, Liberty Interactive has no current plans or proposals or negotiations which would relate to or result
in an extraordinary transaction involving HSNi's business or management, such as a merger, reorganization, liquidation, relocation of any operations, or sale or transfer of a
material amount of assets, or the incurrence of any indebtedness. Following the merger, Liberty Interactive will continuously evaluate and review HSNi's business and operations
and may propose or develop new plans and proposals which it considers to be in the best interests of Liberty Interactive and its stockholders, including engaging in acquisitions
of new businesses or assets, dispositions of existing businesses or assets, the movement of businesses or assets within the Liberty Interactive corporate structure, the alteration of
the mix of assets held by HSNi, or any of the types of extraordinary transactions described above.

Litigation Relating to the Merger 

        On September 7, 2017, a putative class action complaint was filed by a purported HSNi stockholder in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware: McClure
v. HSN, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:17-cv-01279. The complaint names as defendants HSNi and members of the HSNi board. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 14(a) and
20(a) of the Exchange Act and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and alleges that HSNi and the members of the HSNi board caused a registration statement that
allegedly omitted material information to be filed in connection with the merger, which allegedly rendered the registration statement false and misleading. The complaint further
alleges that the members of the HSNi board acted as controlling persons of HSNi and had knowledge of the allegedly false statements contained in the registration statement or
were negligent in not knowing that material information was allegedly omitted from the registration statement. Among other relief, the complaint seeks a declaration certifying a
class, an injunction to prevent the merger from proceeding unless and until HSNi discloses the material information allegedly omitted from the registration statement, unspecified
damages, and unspecified costs, expenses and attorneys' fees. On November 13, 2017, the court entered a stipulated order providing that Defendants are not yet required to
respond to the filed complaint. Instead, Plaintiffs are required to file a consolidated amended complaint 45 days after the court enters an order appointing lead plaintiff and lead
counsel. Defendants' deadline to respond to the consolidated amended complaint is 45 days after the appointed lead plaintiff files the consolidated amended complaint.
Defendants believe the claims are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against all claims asserted.

        On September 28, 2017, a putative class action complaint was filed by a purported HSNi stockholder in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida:
Palkon v. HSN, Inc., et al., Case No. 8:17-cv-2271. The complaint names as defendants HSNi, members of the HSNi board, Liberty Interactive, and Merger Sub. The complaint
asserts claims under Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and alleges that HSNi and the members of the HSNi board
caused a registration statement that omitted material information to be filed in connection with the merger, which allegedly rendered the registration statement false and
misleading. The complaint further alleges that the members of the HSNi board, Liberty Interactive, and Merger Sub acted as controlling persons of HSNi, were involved in the
making and composition of the registration statement, and had knowledge of the allegedly false statements contained in the registration statement. The complaint seeks, among
other relief, an injunction to prevent the merger from proceeding, rescission of the merger, an order directing HSNi to disseminate a registration statement that does not contain
any untrue statements of material fact, a judgment declaring a violation of Sections 14(a) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder,
unspecified damages, and unspecified costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees. The deadline for certain members of the HSNi board to respond to the complaint is December 8, 2017.
Defendants believe the claims are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against all claims asserted.

Security Ownership of Certain HSNi Beneficial Owners and Management/Directors

        To HSNi's knowledge, the following tables set forth information as of the close of business on November 24, 2017 or such other specified date, with respect to the beneficial
ownership of HSNi common stock by (i) each person who, to HSNi's knowledge, is the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of HSNi common stock,
(ii) each director and named executive officer, and (iii) all of its executive officers and directors as a group. The percentages below are based on 52,455,457 shares of HSNi
common stock outstanding on November 24, 2017. In each case, except as otherwise indicated in the footnotes to the tables, the shares of HSNi common stock are owned
directly by the named owners, with sole voting and dispositive power. Under the SEC rules, "beneficial ownership" for purposes of these tables take into account shares as to
which the individual or entity has or shares voting and/or investment power as well as shares of HSNi common stock that may be acquired within 60 days of November 24, 2017
or such other specified date (such as by exercising vested stock options or RSUs subject to vesting within 60 days).

Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions 

Relationship Between HSNi and Liberty Interactive

        On May 13, 2008, in connection with the settlement of litigation relating to the spin-offs by IAC to its stockholders of HSNi, ILG, Ticketmaster and LendingTree (the IAC
spin-off), Liberty Interactive (then known as Liberty Media Corporation) and certain of its affiliates entered into a spinco agreement with IAC and, for limited purposes, Barry
Diller, governing Liberty Interactive's rights with respect to each of the entities to be distributed in connection with the IAC spin-off. On August 20, 2008, Liberty Interactive and
Liberty USA Holdings, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive that held all of the shares of IAC common stock and IAC Class B common stock beneficially
owned by Liberty Interactive, entered into the Spinco Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the Spinco Assignment Agreement) with IAC and HSNi, pursuant to which IAC
assigned and HSNi assumed from IAC all of IAC's rights and obligations under such spinco agreement that provide for certain post-IAC spin-off arrangements relating to HSNi.
Such spinco agreement, as assigned to HSNi pursuant to the Spinco Assignment Agreement, is referred to as the Spinco Agreement.

        In addition, on August 20, 2008, as required by the Spinco Agreement, Liberty Interactive and HSNi entered into a registration rights agreement (the registration rights
agreement).

Spinco Agreement

Representation of Liberty Interactive on the HSNi Board

        The Spinco Agreement provides that so long as Liberty Interactive beneficially owns securities of HSNi representing at least 20% of the total voting power of HSNi's equity
securities, Liberty Interactive has the right to nominate 20% of the directors serving on the HSNi board (rounded up to the nearest whole number). Any director nominated by
Liberty Interactive must be reasonably acceptable to a majority of the directors on the HSNi board who were not nominated by Liberty Interactive. Pursuant to the Spinco
Agreement, HSNi will cause each director that Liberty Interactive nominates to be included in the slate of nominees recommended by the HSNi board to the HSNi stockholders
for election as directors at each annual meeting of HSNi stockholders and HSNi will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the election of each such Liberty Interactive
designee, including soliciting proxies in favor of the election of such designees. Liberty Interactive has the right to designate a replacement director to the HSNi board in order to
fill any vacancy of a director previously designated by Liberty Interactive. Currently, two designees of Liberty Interactive serve on the nine-person HSNi board.

        Pursuant to the Spinco Agreement, all but one of Liberty Interactive's nominees serving on the HSNi board must qualify as "independent" under applicable stock exchange
rules. In addition, pursuant

Table of Contents

to the Spinco Agreement, the Nominating and/or Governance Committee of the HSNi board may include only directors who are Qualified Directors, which is defined in the
Spinco Agreement as any member of the HSNi board other than any director who (i) was nominated by Liberty Interactive, (ii) is an officer or employee of HSNi or (iii) with
respect to any person becoming a director following the IAC spin-off, was not nominated by the Nominating and/or Governance Committee in their initial election to the HSNi
board and for whose election Liberty Interactive voted shares.

Acquisition Restrictions

        Pursuant to the Spinco Agreement, Liberty Interactive may not acquire (except acquisitions made pursuant to rights offerings or similar offerings generally available to
holders of equity securities of HSNi) beneficial ownership of any equity securities of HSNi unless:

• after giving effect to such acquisition, Liberty Interactive's voting power of HSNi would not exceed the Applicable Percentage (as defined below); 

• the acquisition was approved in advance by a majority of the Qualified Directors; or 

• the acquisition is permitted under the provisions described in "—Competing Offers" below.

        The Applicable Percentage initially was Liberty Interactive's voting power in HSNi upon the IAC spin-off, plus 5%, but in no event more than 35%. Following the IAC
spin-off, the Applicable Percentage would be reduced for specified transfers of equity securities of HSNi by Liberty Interactive. The Applicable Percentage is currently 35%.

Transfer Restrictions

        Pursuant to the Spinco Agreement, unless a majority of the Qualified Directors consent, Liberty Interactive cannot transfer any equity securities of HSNi to any person
except for the following permitted transfers:

• transfers to HSNi or a subsidiary of HSNi; 

• transfers under Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or, if Rule 144 is not applicable, in "broker transactions"); 

• transfers to Liberty Interactive or any of its affiliates that agrees in writing to be bound by the terms of the Spinco Agreement; 

• transfers pursuant to a third party tender or exchange offer for equity securities of HSNi or in connection with any merger or other business combination involving
HSNi, which merger or business combination has been approved by HSNi; 

• transfers made in a public offering designed to result in a wide distribution; provided that no such transfer is made, to the knowledge of Liberty Interactive, to any
person whose ownership percentage (based on voting power) of HSNi's equity securities, after giving effect to the transfer, would exceed 15%; 

• a transfer of all of the equity securities of HSNi beneficially owned by Liberty Interactive and its affiliates in a single transaction if the transferee's voting power
of HSNi, after giving effect to the transfer, would not exceed the Applicable Percentage and the transferee assumes all of the rights and obligations (subject to
limited exceptions) of Liberty Interactive under the Spinco Agreement; 

• indirect transfers of HSNi securities resulting from changes in the beneficial ownership of Liberty Interactive or any of its affiliates that hold equity securities of
HSNi;

• a transfer of HSNi securities resulting from certain spin-off or split-off transactions to stockholders of Liberty Interactive, so long as the entity beneficially owning
such securities as a result of such spin-off or split-off enters into an agreement assuming all of Liberty Interactive's rights and obligations under the Spinco
Agreement effective upon such spin-off or split-off; and 

• specified transfers relating to certain hedging transactions or stock lending transactions in respect of the HSNi securities beneficially owned by Liberty Interactive,
subject to specified restrictions.

Competing Offers

        For so long as Liberty Interactive has the right to nominate directors to the HSNi board, if the HSNi board determines to pursue certain types of transactions on a negotiated
basis (either through an "auction" or with a bidder), Liberty Interactive has certain rights to compete with the bidder or bidders, including the right to receive certain notices and
information, subject to specified conditions and limitations. In connection with any such transaction that HSNi is negotiating with a single bidder, the HSNi board must consider
any offer for a transaction made in good faith by Liberty Interactive but is not obligated to accept any such offer or to enter into negotiations with Liberty Interactive.

        If a third party (x) commences a tender or exchange offer for at least 35% of the capital stock of HSNi other than pursuant to an agreement with HSNi or (y) publicly
discloses that its voting power exceeds 20% and the HSNi board fails to take certain actions to block such third party from acquiring voting power of HSNi exceeding the
Applicable Percentage, then Liberty Interactive will be relieved of its obligations described under "—Acquisition Restrictions" above to the extent reasonably necessary to permit
Liberty Interactive to commence and consummate a competing offer. If Liberty Interactive's voting power as a result of the consummation of a competing offer in response to a
tender or exchange offer described in (x) above exceeds 50%, any consent or approval requirements of the Qualified Directors in the Spinco Agreement will be terminated, and,
following the date that Liberty Interactive's voting power exceeds 50%, the obligations described under "—Acquisition Restrictions" above will be terminated.

        The foregoing summary description of the Spinco Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Spinco Agreement, which
HSNi has filed as Exhibit 10.6 to the Current Report on Form 8-K on August 25, 2008.

Registration Rights Agreement

        On August 20, 2008, Liberty Interactive and HSNi entered into the registration rights agreement. Pursuant to the registration rights agreement, Liberty Interactive and its
permitted transferees (the Holders) are entitled to three demand registration rights (and unlimited piggyback registration rights) in respect of the shares of HSNi common stock
received by Liberty Interactive in the IAC spin-off and other shares of HSNi common stock acquired by Liberty Interactive consistent with the Spinco Agreement (collectively,
the Registrable Shares). The Holders are permitted to exercise their registration rights in connection with certain hedging transactions that they may enter into in respect of the
Registrable Shares. HSNi is obligated to indemnify the Holders, and each selling Holder is obligated to indemnify HSNi, against specified liabilities in connection with
misstatements or omissions in any registration statement.

        The foregoing summary description of the registration rights agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the registration rights
agreement, which HSNi has filed as Exhibit 10.5 to the Current Report on Form 8-K on August 25, 2008.

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences 

        The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger to U.S. Holders (as defined below) of HSNi common stock who
exchange their shares of HSNi common stock for shares of Liberty QVCA common stock in the merger.

        This discussion is based on the Code, applicable U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial authority, and administrative rulings and practice, all as in effect
as of the date of this proxy statement/prospectus, all of which may change, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could affect the accuracy of the statements and
conclusions set forth in this discussion.

        For purposes of this discussion, the term "U.S. Holder" means a beneficial owner of HSNi common stock that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 

• a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any
state thereof, or the District of Columbia; 

• an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

• a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the
authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S.
person.

        If an entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds HSNi common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such entity
generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner in a partnership holding HSNi common stock, please consult your tax
advisor regarding the tax consequences of the merger.

        This discussion only addresses those U.S. Holders that hold their shares of HSNi common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally,
property held for investment). Further, this summary does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to U.S. Holders in light of their particular
circumstances or that may be applicable to U.S. Holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law (including, for example, financial institutions, dealers or
brokers in securities, traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment, insurance companies, mutual funds, tax-exempt organizations, partnerships or other flow-through
entities and their partners or members, U.S. expatriates, HSNi stockholders who are not U.S. Holders, HSNi stockholders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar,
HSNi stockholders who hold their HSNi common stock as part of a hedge, appreciated financial position, straddle, constructive sale, wash sale, or conversion or integrated
transaction, HSNi stockholders that beneficially own five percent or more of HSNi common stock, and HSNi stockholders who acquired their HSNi common stock through the
exercise of employee stock options or other compensation arrangements). Moreover, this discussion does not address any alternative minimum tax, any "Medicare" tax on certain
net investment income, or any state, local, foreign or other federal tax consequences of the merger.

        ALL HOLDERS OF HSNi COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE MERGER TO
THEM, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF ANY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX LAWS.

U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Merger

        It is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the merger will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. However, the
completion of the merger is not conditioned on the merger qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment or upon the receipt of an opinion of counsel to that effect. In addition,
neither Liberty Interactive nor HSNi intends to request a ruling from the IRS regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the merger. Accordingly, no assurance
can be given that the merger will qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment. Further, even if Liberty Interactive and HSNi conclude that the merger qualifies for the Intended
Tax Treatment, no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge that conclusion or that a court would not sustain such a challenge.

        If, at the effective time of the merger, any requirement for the merger to qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment is not satisfied, then a U.S. Holder generally would
recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the fair market value of the shares of Liberty QVCA common stock received in the merger and
the amount of any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Liberty QVCA common stock pursuant to the merger and (ii) such holder's basis in the shares of HSNi common
stock surrendered. Gain or loss must be calculated separately for each block of HSNi common stock exchanged by such U.S. Holder if such blocks were acquired at different
times or for different prices. Any gain or loss recognized generally would be capital gain or loss, and long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's holding period in a
particular block of HSNi common stock exceeds one year as of the closing date of the merger. Long-term capital gains recognized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder currently are
eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. Holder's holding period in shares of Liberty QVCA
common stock received in the merger would begin on the day following the merger.

        The remainder of this discussion under "—Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" assumes that the merger will qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment.

        Assuming the merger so qualifies, a U.S. Holder will not recognize any gain or loss upon the receipt of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock in the merger, except with
respect to cash received in lieu of a fractional share of Liberty QVCA common stock. The U.S. Holder's aggregate tax basis in the Liberty QVCA common stock received in the
merger (including any fractional share deemed received and sold as described below) will be equal to the aggregate tax basis of the shares of HSNi common stock surrendered,
and the U.S. Holder's holding period for shares of Liberty QVCA common stock received in the merger (including any fractional share deemed received and sold as described
below) will include such holder's holding period for its shares of HSNi common stock surrendered therefor.

        If a U.S. Holder has acquired different blocks of HSNi common stock at different times or at different prices, then such holder's tax basis and holding period in shares of
Liberty QVCA common stock received in the merger may be determined with reference to each block of HSNi common stock. Any such holders should consult their tax advisors
with respect to identifying the bases or holding periods of the shares of Liberty QVCA common stock received in the merger.

        A U.S. Holder that receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of Liberty QVCA common stock generally will be treated as having received such fractional share in the merger
and then as having sold such fractional share for cash. Such U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received in lieu
of the fractional share of Liberty QVCA common stock and the tax basis allocated to such fractional share of Liberty QVCA common stock. Such gain or loss generally will be
capital gain or loss, and long-term capital gain or loss if the holding period for such fractional share (including the holding period of the HSNi common stock surrendered
therefor) is more than one year as of the closing date of the merger. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders currently are eligible for preferential U.S. federal
income tax rates.            The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

        Information returns will be filed with the IRS in connection with payments of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Liberty QVCA common stock made to a U.S. Holder
(other than U.S. Holders that are exempt recipients, such as corporations). In addition, U.S. federal backup withholding (currently, at a rate of 28%) may apply to such cash
payments, unless the U.S. Holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or furnishes its taxpayer identification number and other required information to the exchange agent,
and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules. Any amount withheld under the backup withholding rules is not an additional tax and
may be refunded or credited against such U.S. Holder's federal income tax liability, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

Availability of Documents 

        The reports, opinions or appraisals referenced in "Special Factors" will be made available for inspection and copying at the principal executive offices of HSNi during its
regular business hours by any interested holder of HSNi common stock or representative who has been designated in writing, and copies may be obtained by requesting them in
writing or by telephone from HSNi at the address provided under the caption "Additional Information—Where You Can Find More Information" in this proxy
statement/prospectus which is incorporated herein by reference.

Following the transaction Liberty Interactive owned approximately 22% of the equity and 57% of the total votes of all classes of TripAdvisor
common stock. On August 27, 2014, Liberty Interactive completed the spin-off of its former wholly owned subsidiary, Liberty TripAdvisor (the
Liberty TripAdvisor spin-off), to holder of shares of its Liberty Ventures common stock. At the time of the Liberty TripAdvisor spin-off, Liberty
TripAdvisor was comprised of Liberty Interactive's former interest in TripAdvisor as well as BuySeasons, Inc., Liberty Interactive's former
wholly-owned subsidiary, and corporate level debt. Following the completion of the Liberty TripAdvisor spin-off, Liberty Interactive and Liberty
TripAdvisor operate as separate, publicly traded companies, and neither has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. The
consolidated financial statements of Liberty Interactive have been prepared to reflect Liberty TripAdvisor as discontinued operations. However,
the noncontrolling interest attributable to its former ownership interest in TripAdvisor is included in the noncontrolling interest line item in the
consolidated balance sheet from the date of acquisition until the date of completion of the Liberty TripAdvisor spin-off.

(2) The split-off of Liberty Expedia was effected on November 4, 2016 through the redemption of a portion of LVNTA and LVNTB for shares of the
corresponding series of common stock of Liberty Expedia. The consolidated financial statements of Liberty Interactive have been prepared to
reflect Liberty Interactive's interest in Expedia, Inc. as a discontinued operation. 

(3) Includes earnings (losses) from continuing operations attributable to the noncontrolling interests of $39 million, $42 million, $40 million,

UNAUDITED COMPARATIVE PER SHARE INFORMATION 

        Presented below are the QVC Group's and HSNi's historical and pro forma per share data for the year ended December 31, 2016 and nine months ended
September 30, 2017. Except for the historical information for the year ended December 31, 2016, the information provided in the table below is unaudited. This
information should be read together with the historical consolidated financial statements and related notes of the QVC Group and HSNi filed by each with the SEC, and
incorporated by reference in this proxy statement/prospectus, and with the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements included in the section entitled
"Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements."

        The pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have
occurred if the merger had been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of the future operating results or financial position
of the combined company. The pro forma information, although helpful in illustrating the financial characteristics of the combined company under one set of assumptions,
does not reflect the benefits of expected cost savings, opportunities to earn additional revenue, the impact of restructuring, or other factors that may result as a consequence
of the merger and, accordingly, does not attempt to predict or suggest future results.

QVC Group Pro Forma Per Share Data 

        This table shows pro forma per share information for QVC Group common stock after giving effect to the HSNi business combination.

        The above pro forma earnings per share data was calculated by dividing net earnings (loss) attributable to QVC Group stockholders per the pro forma condensed
combined statements of operations by 492 million common shares, which is the aggregate number of shares of Liberty QVCA common stock and QVCB outstanding if the
business combination had occurred on September 30, 2017. The pro forma book value per share information was calculated by dividing QVC Group net assets plus pro
forma adjustments to total equity per the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet by 492 million common shares outstanding.

        The declaration of dividends is at the discretion of the HSNi board. The HSNi board periodically reviews the HSNi dividend policy based upon HSNi's financial
results and cash flow projections. Decisions regarding whether or not to pay dividends and the amount of any dividends are determined after consideration of various
factors, including earnings, cash requirements, the financial condition of HSNi, the DGCL, limitations under the merger agreement and other factors deemed relevant by
the HSNi board.

Comparison of Liberty QVCA Common Stock and HSNi Market Prices and Implied Value of Share Value of the Stock Consideration 

        The following table sets forth the closing sale price per share of Liberty QVCA common stock and HSNi common stock as reported on Nasdaq on July 5, 2017, the
last trading day prior to the public announcement of the merger, and on November 24, 2017, the last practicable trading day before the filing of this proxy
statement/prospectus with the SEC. The table also shows the estimated implied value of the stock consideration proposed for each share of HSNi common stock as of the
same two dates. This implied value was calculated by multiplying the closing price of a share of Liberty QVCA common stock on the relevant date by the exchange ratio
of 1.650 shares of Liberty QVCA common stock in exchange for each share of HSNi common stock.

        The market prices of Liberty QVCA common stock and HSNi common stock have fluctuated since the date of the public announcement of the merger agreement and
will continue to fluctuate prior to, and in the case of Liberty QVCA common stock, after, completion of the merger. No assurance can be given concerning the market
prices of Liberty QVCA common stock or HSNi common stock before completion of the merger or of Liberty QVCA common stock after completion of the merger.
Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement the exchange ratio is fixed, but the market price of Liberty QVCA common stock (and therefore the value of the merger
consideration) to be received by HSNi stockholders in the merger could be greater than, less than or the same as the prices shown in the table above after the merger is
completed. Accordingly, holders of Liberty QVCA common stock and HSNi stockholders are encouraged to obtain current market quotations for Liberty QVCA common
stock and HSNi common stock and to review carefully the other information contained in this proxy statement/prospectus or incorporated by reference herein. For more

  Rights of HSNi stockholders  Rights of QVCA stockholders
Voting Rights  HSNi stockholders are entitled to one vote for each share of HSNi

common stock held on each matter properly submitted to the HSNi
stockholders for their vote, provided that, unless otherwise required
by law, HSNi stockholders may not vote on any amendment to the
HSNi charter (including any preferred stock designation) that relate
solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of preferred
stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled to vote
thereon pursuant to the HSNi charter (including any preferred stock
designation).

 QVCA stockholders are entitled to one vote for each share of such
stock held of record and holders of QVCB (the QVCB
stockholders) are entitled to ten votes for each share of such stock
held of record, on all matters submitted to a vote of its
stockholders. Holders of Liberty QVCK common stock (the
QVCK stockholders) are not entitled to any voting powers, except
as otherwise required by Delaware law. When so required, the
QVCK stockholders will be entitled to 1/100th of a vote for each
share of such stock held of record.

Holders of QVCA, QVCB and QVCK (collectively, the QVC
Group stockholders) will vote as a single class, along with
holders of Liberty Ventures common stock (the Liberty Ventures
stockholders) on all matters that are submitted to a vote of its
stockholders unless a separate class vote is required by the terms of
the Liberty Interactive charter, Delaware law or any preferred stock
designation.

   
In connection with certain dispositions of QVC Group assets, the
Liberty Interactive board may determine to seek the approval of the
holders of the majority of the aggregate voting power of QVC
Group common stock, voting together as a separate class, to avoid
effecting a mandatory dividend, redemption or conversion under
the Liberty Interactive charter.

   
Liberty Interactive may not redeem outstanding shares of QVC
Group common stock for shares of common stock of a subsidiary
that holds assets and liabilities attributed to the QVC Group unless
its board of directors seeks and receives the approval to such
redemption by holders of the majority of the aggregate voting
power of QVC Group common stock, voting together as a separate
class, and, if such subsidiary also holds assets and liabilities of the
Ventures Group, the approval of holders of the majority of the
aggregate voting power of Liberty Ventures common stock, voting
together as a separate class.

    Supermajority

Liberty Interactive imposes supermajority voting requirements in
connection with certain charter amendments and other
extraordinary transactions which have not been approved by 75%
of the directors then in office. When these requirements apply, the
threshold vote required is 662/3% of the aggregate voting power of

Dividends and Securities
Distributions

 The DGCL provides that a corporation's board of directors may
declare and pay dividends to its stockholders, subject to the terms
of its certificate of incorporation, either out of surplus, or, if there
is no surplus, out of net profits for the current or preceding fiscal
year in which the dividend is declared, subject to certain
limitations.

Subject to prior dividend rights of the holders of preferred stock,
HSNi stockholders are entitled to receive dividends when, as and if
declared by the HSNi board out of funds legally available for that
purpose.

 Liberty Interactive is permitted to pay dividends on QVC Group
common stock out of the lesser of its assets legally available for the
payment of dividends and the "QVC Group Available Dividend
Amount" (defined generally as a fraction of the excess of the total
assets less the total liabilities of the QVC Group over the aggregate
par value, or any greater amount determined to be capital in respect
of, all outstanding shares of QVC Group common stock and each
series of preferred stock attributed to the QVC Group or, if there is
no such excess, an amount equal to the earnings or loss attributable
to the QVC Group (if positive) for the fiscal year in which such
dividend is to be paid and/or the preceding fiscal year). If
dividends (other than share distributions) are paid on any series of
QVC Group common stock, an equal per share dividend will be
paid on the other series of QVC Group common stock.

Liberty Interactive may redeem at any time outstanding shares of
QVC Group common stock for shares of common stock of a
subsidiary that holds assets and liabilities attributed to the QVC

and receives the approval to such redemption of the QVC Group
stockholders, voting together as a separate class.

described above as well as the separate class vote of Liberty
Ventures stockholders.

Mandatory Dividend, Redemption
and Conversion Rights on
Certain Dispositions of Assets

 
Not applicable.

 If Liberty Interactive disposes, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the QVC
Group, it is required to choose one of the following alternatives no
less than 120 trading days following such transaction(s), unless its
board of directors obtains the approval of the QVC Group
stockholders to not take such action or the disposition qualifies
under specified exemptions (in which case Liberty Interactive will
not be required to take any of the follow actions):

• pay a dividend to the QVC Group stockholders equal to the
available net proceeds of such disposition;

• if there are legally sufficient assets and the "QVC Group
Available Dividend Amount" would have been sufficient to pay
a dividend, then: (i) if the disposition involves all (not merely
substantially all) of the assets of the QVC Group, redeem all
outstanding shares of QVC Group common stock in exchange
for cash and/or securities or other assets with a fair value equal
to the available net proceeds of such disposition, or (ii) if the
disposition involves substantially all (but not all) of the assets of
the QVC Group, redeem a portion of the outstanding shares of
QVC Group common stock in exchange for cash and/or
securities or other assets with a fair value equal to the available
net proceeds of such disposition;

• convert each outstanding share of each series of QVC Group
common stock into a number of shares of the corresponding
series of Liberty Ventures common stock at a specified premium;

QVC Group common stock into a number of shares of the
corresponding series of Liberty Ventures common stock with
either the payment of a dividend on or a redemption of shares of
QVC Group common stock, subject to certain limitations.

Inter-Group Interest
 

Not applicable.
 

From time to time, the Liberty Interactive board may determine to
create an inter-group interest in the QVC Group in favor of the
Ventures Group, or vice versa, subject to the terms of the Liberty
Interactive charter.

   
If the QVC Group has an inter-group interest in the Ventures Group
at such time as any extraordinary action is taken with respect to the
Liberty Ventures common stock (such as the payment of a
dividend, a share distribution, the redemption of such stock for
stock of a subsidiary or an action required to be taken in
connection with a disposition of all or substantially all of the
Ventures Group's assets), the Liberty Interactive board will
consider what actions are required, or permitted, to be taken under
the Liberty Interactive charter with respect to the QVC Group's
inter-group interest in the Ventures Group. For example, in some
instances, the Liberty Interactive board may determine that a
portion of the aggregate consideration that is available for
distribution to Liberty Ventures stockholders must be allocated to
the QVC Group to compensate the QVC Group on a pro rata basis
for its interest in the Ventures Group.

   
Similarly, if the Ventures Group has an inter-group interest in the
QVC Group at such time as any extraordinary action is taken with
respect to the QVC Group common stock (such as the payment of a
dividend, a share distribution, the redemption of such stock for
stock of a subsidiary or an action required to be taken in
connection with a disposition of all or substantially all of the QVC
Group's assets), the Liberty Interactive board will consider what
actions are required, or permitted, to be taken under the Liberty
Interactive charter with respect to the Ventures Group's inter-group
interest in the QVC Group.

directors to amend the Liberty Interactive bylaws without any vote
of the stockholders.

Limitation of Personal Liability of
Directors

 
HSNi's directors are not liable to it or any of its stockholders for
monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duties while serving as
director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the director's duty
of loyalty to HSNi or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions not
in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL or (iv) for
any transaction from which the director derived an improper
personal benefit.

 
To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, Liberty Interactive's
directors are not liable to it or any of its stockholders for monetary
damages for breaches of fiduciary duties while serving as a
director.

 
If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further
eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the
liability of a director of HSNi will be eliminated or limited to the
fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended.

 
 

Indemnification
 

HSNi indemnifies, to the fullest extent permitted the DGCL, any
person involved in any suit, action or proceeding by reason of the
fact that such person is a director or officer of HSNi or, at its
request, a director, officer, or trustee of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture or other enterprise, against all liability,
loss and expenses incurred by such person, provided that HSNi will
not indemnify such indemnitee in connection with proceedings
initiated by such indemnitee unless such proceeding was
authorized by its board of directors. HSNi will pay expenses of a
director or officer in defending any proceeding in advance of its
final disposition, provided that such payment is made upon receipt
of an undertaking by the director or officer to repay all amounts
advanced if it should be ultimately determined that the director or
officer is not entitled to indemnification.

THE HSNi SPECIAL MEETING 

Time, Place and Date 

        The HSNi special meeting will be held at 10:00 a.m., local time, on December 29, 2017, at HSNi's corporate headquarters, located at 1 HSN Drive, St. Petersburg, Florida
33729, telephone (727) 872-1000.

Purpose of the HSNi Special Meeting 

        At the HSNi special meeting, the HSNi stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon:

• the merger agreement proposal; 

• the adjournment proposal; and 

• the non-binding compensation advisory proposal.

Recommendation of the HSNi Board 

        The HSNi board recommends that the HSNi stockholders vote:

• "FOR" the merger agreement proposal; 

• "FOR" the adjournment proposal; and 

• "FOR" the non-binding compensation advisory proposal.

        See "Special Factors—HSNi's Purpose and Reasons for the Merger and Other Proposals; Recommendations of the Special Committee and HSNi Board; Fairness of the
Merger."

HSNi Record Date; Stock Entitled to Vote 

        Only HSNi stockholders, as recorded in HSNi's stock register as of the HSNi record date for the HSNi special meeting, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the HSNi
special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

Quorum 

        In order to conduct the business of the HSNi special meeting, a quorum must be present. A quorum will exist at the HSNi special meeting if the holders of a majority of the
voting power of all of the shares of HSNi common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote on the HSNi record date are present in person or represented by proxy at the
HSNi special meeting. All shares represented by proxy are counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum, including abstentions. If a broker is a record holder of your
shares and it indicates on the form of proxy that the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote those shares, or if those shares are voted in circumstances in which proxy
authority is defective or has been withheld, those shares will not be treated as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, unless you instruct your broker how
to vote those shares. If a quorum is not established with respect to the HSNi special meeting, the chairman of the meeting or the HSNi stockholders present may adjourn the
meeting despite the absence of a quorum.

        If you submit a properly executed proxy card, even if you do not vote for some or all of the proposals or vote to "abstain" in respect of some or all of the proposals, your
shares of HSNi common stock will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the HSNi special meeting.

Required Vote 

        Approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the aggregate voting power of HSNi common stock outstanding and entitled to vote
on such proposal, voting together as a single class. Your abstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger agreement proposal (assuming a
quorum is present).

        Approval of each of the adjournment proposal and the non-binding compensation advisory proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively
or negatively on such proposal. Your abstention or failure to vote will have no effect on the adjournment proposal or the non-binding compensation advisory proposal (assuming
a quorum is present).

on the HSNi record date.

proposal, the adjournment proposal and the non-binding compensation advisory proposal.

        If you submit a proxy in which you indicate that you abstain from voting, your shares will count as present for purposes of determining a quorum, but will have the same

quorum is present).

        If you do not submit a proxy or you do not vote in person at the HSNi special meeting, your shares will not be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of

• give written notice before the meeting to the HSNi Corporate Secretary at the above address stating that you are revoking your proxy; or

adopt the merger agreement and/or if there are not sufficient shares present in person or by proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum and (iii) in favor of any other matter

Attending the HSNi Special Meeting 

        You are entitled to attend the HSNi special meeting only if you were a stockholder of record of HSNi as of the at the close of business on the HSNi record date or you held
your shares of HSNi common stock beneficially in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee as of the close of business on the HSNi record date, or you hold a valid proxy for
the HSNi special meeting.

        If you were a stockholder of record of HSNi as of the close of business on the HSNi record date and wish to attend the HSNi special meeting, please so indicate on the
appropriate proxy card or as prompted by the Internet or telephone voting system. Your name will be verified against the list of HSNi stockholders of record prior to your being
admitted to the HSNi special meeting.

        If a broker, bank or other nominee is the record owner of your shares of HSNi common stock, you will need to have proof that you are the beneficial owner at the close of
business on the HSNi record date to be admitted to the HSNi special meeting. A recent account statement or letter from your broker, bank or other nominee confirming your
beneficial ownership as of the HSNi record date, or presentation of a valid proxy from a broker, bank or other nominee that is the record owner of your shares, would be
acceptable proof of your beneficial ownership.

        You should be prepared to present government issued photo identification for admittance. If you do not provide photo identification or comply with the other procedures
outlined above upon request, you might not be admitted to the HSNi special meeting.

Stockholder List 

        A complete list of HSNi stockholders entitled to vote at the HSNi special meeting will be available for examination by any such stockholder for a period of at least ten days
prior to the HSNi special meeting. This stockholder list will be available for inspection during ordinary business hours at HSNi's principal place of business located at 1 HSN
Drive, St. Petersburg, Florida 33729.

        The preliminary voting results will be announced at the HSNi special meeting. In addition, within four business days following the HSNi special meeting, HSNi intends to
file the final voting results with the SEC on a Current Report on Form 8-K. If the final voting results have not been certified within that four business day period, HSNi will
report the preliminary voting results on a Current Report on Form 8-K at that time and will file an amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K to report the final voting results
within four business days of the date that the final results are certified.

        HSNi STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD CAREFULLY READ THIS PROXY STATEMENT/PROSPECTUS IN ITS ENTIRETY FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION
CONCERNING THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROPOSAL AND THE OTHER MATTERS TO BE VOTED ON AT THE HSNi SPECIAL MEETING.

Householding 

        To reduce the expense of delivering duplicate proxy materials to HSNi stockholders who may have more than one account holding HSNi common stock but who share the
same address, HSNi has adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this procedure, certain stockholders of record who have the same address and
last name will receive only one copy of this

proxy statement/prospectus until such time as one or more of these stockholders notifies HSNi that they want to receive separate copies. In addition, the broker, bank or other
nominee for any stockholder who is a beneficial owner of HSNi common stock may deliver only one copy of this proxy statement/prospectus to multiple HSNi stockholders who
share the same address, unless that broker, bank or other nominee has received contrary instructions from one or more of the HSNi stockholders. This procedure reduces
duplicate mailings and saves printing costs and postage fees, as well as natural resources. HSNi stockholders who participate in householding will continue to have access to and
utilize separate proxy voting instructions. If, now or in the future, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy
statement/prospectus or other proxy materials, please notify HSNi by calling HSNi's Investor Relations Department at (727) 872-1000 or by sending a written request to HSNi's
Investor Relations Department at HSN, Inc., 1 HSN Drive, St. Petersburg, Florida 33729, Attn.: Investor Relations, email: ir@hsn.net, and HSNi will promptly deliver a separate
copy of these materials. Record owners who are receiving multiple copies and wish to receive only one, please call HSNi's Investor Relations Department at the number listed
above or send a written request to HSNi's Investor Relations Department at the address listed above.

HSNi PROPOSALS 

HSNi Proposal 1: The Merger Agreement Proposal 

        HSNi is asking the HSNi stockholders to consider and vote on the adoption of the merger agreement, which provides for the terms and conditions of the merger. In the
merger, each HSNi stockholder (other than Liberty Interactive and its wholly owned subsidiaries) will receive 1.650 shares of Liberty QVCA common stock, in exchange for
each share of HSNi common stock held by such holder immediately prior to the effective time. For a detailed discussed of the merger and the merger agreement, see "Special
Factors—The Merger Agreement."

        As discussed in the section entitled "Special Factors—HSNi's Purpose and Reasons for the Merger and Other Proposals; Recommendations of the Special Committee and
HSNi Board; Fairness of the Merger," the HSNi board, acting on the recommendation of the Special Committee, has determined the proposed merger to be advisable, fair to and
in the best interests of HSNi and the HSNi stockholders.

        The approval by the HSNi stockholders of the merger agreement proposal is required by Section 251 of the DGCL and is a condition to the completion of the merger. If the
merger agreement proposal is not approved, the merger will not occur.

Required Vote

        Approval of the merger agreement proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the aggregate voting power of HSNi common stock outstanding and entitled to vote
on the proposal, voting together as a single class. Your abstention or failure to vote will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the merger agreement proposal.

Vote Recommendation

        The HSNi board recommends a vote "FOR" the merger agreement proposal.

HSNi Proposal 2: The Adjournment Proposal 

        HSNi stockholders are also being asked to consider and vote on a proposal to adjourn or postpone the HSNi special meeting, if necessary and for a minimum period of time
reasonable under the circumstances, to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to this proxy statement/prospectus is provided to HSNi stockholders a reasonable
amount of time in advance of the HSNi special meeting, or to solicit additional proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the special meeting to approve the
proposal to adopt the merger agreement.

        The approval by the HSNi stockholders of the adjournment proposal is not a condition to the completion of the merger.

Required Vote

        Approval of the adjournment proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively. Your abstention or failure to vote
will have no effect on the outcome of the vote (assuming a quorum is present).

Vote Recommendation

        The HSNi board recommends a vote "FOR" the adjournment proposal.

HSNi Proposal 3: The Non-Binding Compensation Advisory Proposal 

        As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder, which were enacted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act, HSNi is required to provide the HSNi stockholders the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, certain compensation that may
be paid or become payable to HSNi's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the merger, as described in the section entitled "Special Factors—Interests
of Certain Persons of HSNi in the Merger." Accordingly, HSNi stockholders are being provided the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on such payments.

        As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon HSNi or the HSNi board, and approval of this proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger. Because the
merger-related executive compensation to be paid in connection with the merger is based on the terms of the merger agreement as well as the contractual arrangements with
HSNi's named executive officers, such compensation will be payable, regardless of the outcome of this advisory vote, if the merger agreement is adopted (subject only to the
contractual conditions applicable thereto). However, HSNi seeks the support of the HSNi stockholders and believes that HSNi stockholder support is appropriate because HSNi
has a comprehensive executive compensation program designed to link the compensation of its executives with HSNi's performance and the interests of HSNi stockholders.

Vote Required

        Approval of the non-binding compensation advisory proposal requires the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively. Your
abstention or failure to vote will have no effect on the outcome of the vote (assuming a quorum is present).

Vote Recommendation

        The HSNi board recommends a vote "FOR" the non-binding compensation advisory proposal.

Interactive") and HSN, Inc. ("HSNi") as if the completion of Liberty Interactive's acquisition of HSNi (the "HSNi business combination") had occurred on the dates specified
below.

        On July 6, 2017, Liberty Interactive announced that it had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 5, 2017 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and
among Liberty Interactive, Liberty Horizon, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive ("Merger Sub"), and HSNi. Pursuant to
the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into HSNi, with HSNi surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Liberty Interactive (the "Merger"). As a
result of the Merger, Liberty Interactive will acquire the approximately 62% of HSNi it does not already own in an all-stock transaction, making HSNi a wholly owned
subsidiary, attributed to the QVC Group tracking stock group. Liberty Interactive currently owns approximately 38% of HSNi. HSNi stockholders (other than Liberty Interactive
or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries) will receive fixed consideration of 1.650 shares of Series A QVC Group common stock (the "Liberty QVCA common stock") for each
share of HSNi common stock. Based on the Liberty QVCA common stock's closing price as of July 5, 2017 and the number of HSNi undiluted shares outstanding as of May 1,
2017, this equates to a total enterprise value for HSNi of $2.6 billion, and an equity value of $2.1 billion. Liberty Interactive expects to issue approximately 53.5 million shares of
Liberty QVCA common stock to HSNi stockholders.

Pro Forma Information 

        The unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the estimated aggregate consideration of approximately $2.0 billion, which represents the equity value of HSNi as of
October 31, 2017. The consideration used in the application of acquisition accounting, after the HSNi business combination is consummated, will be based on HSNi's equity
value as of the acquisition date.

        The unaudited pro forma financial information related to the HSNi business combination was prepared using the acquisition method of accounting and is based on the
assumption that the HSNi business combination took place as of September 30, 2017 for purposes of the unaudited pro forma balance sheet and as of January 1, 2016 for
purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the nine month period ended September 30, 2017.

        In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the actual consolidated financial statements of Liberty Interactive will reflect the HSNi business combination only
from and after the date of the completion of the acquisition. Liberty Interactive has not yet undertaken a detailed analysis of the fair value of HSNi's assets and liabilities and will
not complete the purchase price allocation related to the HSNi business combination until after the transaction is consummated. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma
adjustments are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. Differences between these
preliminary estimates and the final acquisition accounting may occur and these differences could be material. Additionally, the differences, if any, could have a material impact
on the accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements and Liberty Interactive's future results of operations and financial position.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the results of
operations or financial position of Liberty Interactive would actually have been had the business combination occurred on the dates noted

above, or to project the results of operations or financial position of Liberty Interactive for any future periods. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based on available
information and certain assumptions that Liberty Interactive's management believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are directly attributable to the business
combination and are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of Liberty Interactive. In the opinion of Liberty Interactive's management, all adjustments
necessary to present fairly the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information have been made.

        The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the notes hereto along with Liberty Interactive's and
HSNi's most recent historical financial information on Forms 10-K and 10-Q incorporated by reference herein.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information

(1) Basis of Pro Forma Presentation

        The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2017 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations for the
nine months ended September 30, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2016 are based on (i) the historical unaudited consolidated financial statements of Liberty
Interactive Corporation ("Liberty Interactive") as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 contained in Liberty Interactive's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed
with the SEC on November 9, 2017, (ii) the historical audited consolidated financial information of Liberty Interactive as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 contained
in Liberty Interactive's Annual Report on 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2017, (iii) the historical unaudited consolidated financial statements of HSN, Inc. ("HSNi") as
of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 contained in HSNi's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 8, 2017; and (iv) the historical
audited consolidated financial information of HSNi as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 contained in HSNi's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on
February 24, 2017.

        The pro forma adjustments are included only to the extent they are (i) directly attributable to the business combination, (ii) factually supportable, and (iii) with respect to the
unaudited pro forma statements of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results.

        The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the results of operations or financial position
of Liberty Interactive would actually have been had the transaction occurred in prior periods, or to project the results of operations or financial position of Liberty Interactive for
any future periods. The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based on available information and certain assumptions that Liberty Interactive management believes are reasonable.
The unaudited pro forma adjustments are directly attributable to the transaction and are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of Liberty Interactive. In
the opinion of Liberty Interactive management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information have been made.

(2) Estimated Consideration and Pro Forma Purchase Price Allocation

        As required by acquisition accounting, an estimate of such consideration has been made at estimated fair value, which was determined based on HSNi's equity value as of
October 31, 2017, $2.0 billion. The final acquisition consideration may differ significantly from the amount determined as of September 30, 2017. When the final purchase
consideration is determined, such information will be included and amounts could be significant. Had the fair value of HSNi's common stock been 10% higher, total purchase
consideration would have been greater by $200 million and the difference would primarily impact goodwill.

(2) Estimated Consideration and Pro Forma Purchase Price Allocation (Continued)

        The following is a pro forma purchase price allocation as if the HSNi business combination had occurred on September 30, 2017 (amounts in millions):

        The final determination of the allocation of the purchase price will be based on the fair value of such assets and liabilities as of the transaction date and may change
significantly from the amounts used in the pro forma purchase price allocation.

(3) Pro Forma Adjustments

        The unaudited pro forma adjustments related to the HSNi business combination included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are as
follows:

(a) Eliminate Equity Method Investment in HSNi

        As of September 30, 2017, Liberty Interactive's investment in HSNi, accounted for as an equity method investment, had a carrying value of $198 million, and was
eliminated, along with the related deferred tax liability, through Additional paid-in capital in the condensed combined pro forma balance sheet.

(3) Pro Forma Adjustments (Continued)

(c) Trademarks and Trade names

        The pro forma fair value of HSNi's Trademarks and Trade names was estimated based on the percentage of similar assets allocated as part of a recent Liberty Interactive
acquisition within the retail category. We believe such allocation is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The final allocation will be determined by independent appraisal and could
be materially different. HSNi's Trademarks and Trade names are indefinite-lived intangible assets.

(d) Intangible assets subject to amortization, net

        The pro forma fair value of HSNi's Intangible assets subject to amortization, net was estimated based on the percentage of similar assets allocated as part of a recent Liberty
Interactive acquisition within the retail category. We believe such allocation is a reasonable estimate of fair value. The final allocation will be determined by independent
appraisal and could be materially different. Liberty Interactive reclassified a portion of HSNi's historical property and equipment, net amount related to capitalized software to
intangible assets subject to amortization, net to conform to the Liberty Interactive's presentation (see note (e) below).

(e) Deferred income tax liabilities

        The adjustment to deferred income taxes was calculated by applying HSNi's statutory tax rate at September 30, 2017, 38%, to the taxable pro forma adjustments, which are
Intangible assets subject to amortization and Trademarks and Trade names.

(f) Other pro forma adjustments

        In the fourth quarter of 2017, HSNi's Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per common share. The dividend will be paid on December 15, 2017 to
HSNi's stockholders of record as of December 6, 2017. The adjustment in the condensed combined pro forma balance sheet

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information (Continued)

(3) Pro Forma Adjustments (Continued)

for dividends declared of $18 million was calculated using HSNi's shares outstanding as of September 30, 2017 of 52,432,249.

(g) Presentation reclassifications

        The adjustments represent reclassifications to conform HSNi's financial statement presentation and accounting policies to those of Liberty Interactive.

(h) Depreciation and amortization

        The adjustment for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 reverses historical amortization of intangible assets subject to amortization of $15 million and includes
amortization of pro forma intangible assets subject to amortization of $128 million with a weighted average useful life of 5.6 years. The adjustment for the year ended
December 31, 2016 reverses historical amortization of intangible assets subject to amortization of $19 million and includes amortization of pro forma intangible assets subject to
amortization of $170 million with a weighted average useful life of 5.6 years.

(i) Income tax (expense) benefit

        Adjustment to record taxes at Liberty's expected blended tax rate of 37%.

(j) Deal-related costs

        In connection with the HSNi business combination, HSNi incurred approximately $7 million for financial advisory and legal services in the nine months ended
September 30, 2017. As these fees are non-recurring, direct, incremental costs of acquisition, an adjustment has been made to exclude these costs in the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined statement of operations for the corresponding period.

(k) Shares used in computing earnings per share

        As of September 30, 2017, Liberty Interactive intends to issue approximately 53.5 million shares of Liberty QVCA common stock to HSNi stockholders upon completion of
the HSNi business combination. Therefore pro forma shares used to compute earnings per share were calculated using Liberty Interactive historical QVC Group weighted
average shares outstanding at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, plus the approximately 53.5 million shares that will be issued in connection with the HSNi business
combination.

Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no securities of Parent or other consideration shall be

any Company Stockholder, any holder of Merger Sub Common Stock or any other Person:

          (i)  Each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company Stockholders immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares)
shall automatically, and without any election on the part of the Company Stockholders, be converted into and represent the right to receive, and will be
exchangeable for, 1.65 shares of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration").

         (ii)  Each share of Company Common Stock held by Parent or any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, represent all Parent Shares) shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock (the "Parent Surviving Corporation Shares").

        (iii)  From and after the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.6(b)(i), upon the conversion thereof, shall cease to be outstanding and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or a Book Entry Share shall

consideration therefor, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or other distributions to which holders of shares of Company Common
Stock become entitled in accordance with this Article II upon the surrender of such Certificate or transfer of Book Entry Shares in accordance with Section 2.7.

        (c)    Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock.    At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub, any Company Stockholder, any holder of Merger Sub Common Stock or any other Person, each outstanding share of Merger Sub Common Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall automatically be converted into and become a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock equal to the quotient of (x) the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than the Excluded Shares) immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (y) the number of outstanding shares of Merger Sub Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock, together with the Parent Surviving Corporation Shares, shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of
immediately following the Merger.

        (d)    Changes to Stock.    If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Parent QVC
Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, split-up, exchange or readjustment
of shares or any stock or extraordinary cash dividend thereon with a record date during such period, or any similar transaction or event affecting any class or series of
stock (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction as a result of which Parent QVC
Common Stock will be converted or exchanged), the Merger Consideration, the Equity Award Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may
be, shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted to provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock comparable economic effect to that contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event.

        (e)    No Appraisal Rights.    In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to Company Stockholders in connection with the
Merger.

        Section 2.7    Exchange of Certificates and Book Entry Shares.     

        (a)   Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select an institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the
Merger for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book Entry Shares for the Merger Consideration (for the avoidance of doubt, Parent's transfer agent as of the date
hereof shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter or shall have entered into an exchange agent agreement with the
Exchange Agent, which agreement shall set forth the duties, responsibilities and obligations of the Exchange Agent consistent with the terms of this Agreement, and shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Company. Parent will make available to the Exchange Agent, at or prior to the Effective Time, a number of shares of Parent QVCA
Common Stock sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(b)(i) (such shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, the "Exchange Fund"). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of
record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or by appropriate guarantee of delivery in the form
customarily used in transactions of this nature from a member of a national securities exchange, a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or a
commercial bank or trust company in the United States) for use in effecting delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration issuable and payable in respect thereof, and any dividends or other distributions to which
such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(d)(i). Exchange of any Book Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with Parent's customary procedures with
respect to securities represented by book entry.

        (b)    Exchange Procedure.    Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or compliance with Parent's customary procedure with respect
to the exchange of Book Entry Shares, will be entitled to receive (i) the number of shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry
form) that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.6(b)(i), (ii) a check in the amount equal to the cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.7(e) and (iii) any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.7(d)(i). Such Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on
any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares. Until so surrendered, each Certificate and Book Entry Share shall, after
the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration and any dividends and other distributions in accordance with
Section 2.7(b) and Section 2.7(d), and any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent QVCA Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.7(e).

        (c)    Certificate Holder.    If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to or registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the payment or registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
Taxes required as a result of such payment or registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent and the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

        (d)    Dividends and Distributions.    No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or non-transferred Book Entry Shares until such Certificates are properly surrendered or Book Entry Shares are
properly transferred in accordance with this Section 2.7. Following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest thereon, to the record holder of the shares of
Parent QVCA Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender or transfer, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such
shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender or transfer and not
previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender or transfer. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares
of Parent QVCA Common Stock, all shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

        (e)    Fractional Shares.    No fractional shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock shall be issued in connection with the Merger. If any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent QVCA Common Stock as a result of the Merger, such holder of Company Common
Stock will instead receive cash in an amount based on the aggregation and sale of all fractional shares by the Exchange Agent at prevailing market prices on behalf of
such holders (after taking into account applicable procedures of The Depository Trust Company). Any amounts payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to this
Section 2.7(e) will be payable from the proceeds of the aggregation and sale of fractional shares by the Exchange Agent as soon as practicable after the Merger is
completed. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share. The parties hereto acknowledge that the
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to this Section 2.7(e) is not separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.

        (f)    No Further Ownership Rights.    The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.6(b)(i) shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock,
subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may
have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates
or Book Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

        (g)    Termination of Exchange Fund.    Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock for nine
(9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration.

        (h)    No Liability.    None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent QVCA
Common Stock or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official to the extent required by any applicable abandoned

such date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book Entry Share would otherwise irrevocably escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

        (i)    Lost Certificates.    If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall
pay in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock pursuant

this Agreement to any Person, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any applicable provisions of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

        (a)   At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under any Incentive Plan, whether vested or unvested (each, a
"Company Option"), that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the holder of such Company Option, be converted into an option (each, a "Parent Option") to purchase a number of shares of Parent QVCA
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to (A) the exercise price per share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Any
restrictions on the exercise of any Parent Option shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Parent
Option shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption of such Parent Option; provided, however, that: (1) each Parent Option shall, in accordance with
its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, issuance of bonus shares, reverse
stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to Parent QVCA Common Stock subsequent to the Effective
Time; (2) the compensation committee of Parent's board of directors shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof with respect to each Parent Option; and (3) each Parent Option shall be subject to administrative procedures consistent with those in effect under
Parent's equity compensation plan. The Parties hereto acknowledge that the assumption of the Company Options pursuant to this Section 2.8(a) is intended to comply

("Section 409A").

        (b)   At the Effective Time, each stock appreciation right granted under any Incentive Plan with respect to Company Common Stock, whether vested or unvested
(each, a "Company SAR"), that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of such Company SAR, be converted into a stock appreciation right (each, a "Parent SAR") with respect to a number of shares of
Parent QVCA Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of such Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Any
restrictions on the exercise of any Parent SAR shall continue in full force and effect and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Parent
SAR shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption of such Parent SAR; provided, however, that: (1) each Parent SAR shall, in accordance with its
terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, issuance of bonus shares, reverse stock
split, consolidation of shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to Parent QVCA Common Stock subsequent to the Effective Time;
(2) the compensation committee of Parent's board of directors shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof with respect to each Parent SAR; and (3) each Parent SAR shall be subject to administrative procedures consistent with those in effect under Parent's
equity compensation plan. The Parties hereto acknowledge that the assumption of the Company SARs pursuant to this Section 2.8(b) is intended to comply with the
requirements of Treasury Regulations section 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) so as to not result in the grant of a new stock right or otherwise result in the loss of the applicable
exemption from Section 409A.

        (c)   At the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units granted under any Incentive Plan with respect to Company Common Stock (each, a "Company RSU")
that is subject to time-based vesting and that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of such Company RSU, be converted into an award of restricted stock units (each, a "Parent RSU") with respect to a
number of shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock (rounded to the nearest number of whole shares) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Any vesting conditions and restrictions
on the receipt of any Parent RSUs shall continue in full force and effect and the term, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Parent RSUs shall otherwise remain
unchanged as a result of the assumption of such Parent RSUs; provided, however, that: (1) each Parent RSU award shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to
further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, issuance of bonus shares, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction with respect to Parent QVCA Common Stock subsequent to the Effective Time; (2) the compensation
committee of Parent's board of directors shall succeed to the authority and responsibility of the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof with respect
to each Parent RSU award; and (3) each Parent RSU award shall be subject to administrative procedures consistent with those in effect under Parent's equity
compensation plan. For clarity, any award of deferred restricted stock units with respect to Company Common Stock, and any amount deferred under a Company Plan
that is denominated in Company Common Stock, shall be treated as a Company RSU for all purposes under this Agreement.

        (d)   At the Effective Time, each award of performance share units with respect to Company Common Stock (each, a "Company PSU") that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of such
Company PSU, be converted into an award of performance share units (each, a "Parent PSU") with respect to a target number of shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock
(rounded to the nearest number of whole shares) equal to the product of (i) the target number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company PSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Any vesting conditions and restrictions on the receipt of any Parent PSUs shall
continue in full force and effect and the term, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Parent PSUs shall otherwise remain unchanged as a result of the assumption
of such Parent PSUs; provided, however, that: (1) each Parent PSU award shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any
stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock dividend, issuance of bonus shares, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares reclassification, recapitalization or other
similar transaction with respect to Parent QVCA Common Stock subsequent to the Effective Time; (2) the compensation committee of Parent's board of directors shall

of this Agreement in accordance with Article VII, the outstanding shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, then the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of Company Common
Stock (including Company Options exercisable for Company Common Stock, Company SARs exercisable with respect to Company Common Stock, Company RSUs and
Company PSUs) the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.8 shall be construed to permit any Party to

issuance and listing of shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock as are necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.8. Parent shall prepare and
file with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under the Securities Act, with
respect to the shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock subject to the Parent Equity Awards and, where applicable, shall use its reasonable best efforts to have such
registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable following the Effective Time and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement covering the
Parent Equity Awards (and to maintain the current status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long as the Parent Equity Awards remain outstanding.

payable therefor or in respect thereof and (b) the Company Rights Plan will terminate.

communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company's management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls and
procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company SEC Document, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the

significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal controls that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Company's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (ii) the Company does not have Knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls.

        (b)   Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes thereto) contained in or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC
Documents (the "Parent Financial Statements"), (i) complied, as of its respective date of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods indicated (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) and
(iii) fairly presented in all material respects and in accordance with GAAP the consolidated financial position of Parent and as of the respective date thereof and the

15 under the Exchange Act) substantially as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Parent's disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act

this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (c) Liabilities that would not reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and the QVC Group Subsidiaries, taken

Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving,
or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the Parent SEC Documents.

        Section 4.8    Absence of Certain Changes.     Since January 1, 2017, (a) through the date hereof, there has been no event or condition which has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect and (b) the QVC Group Subsidiaries have, in all material respects, conducted their business in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice.

        Section 4.9    Litigation.     As of the date hereof, there is no material Action pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of the QVC Group
Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective properties or assets that if decided adversely against the Parent would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any QVC Group Subsidiary (or any of its or their respective properties or assets) is subject to or bound by any Order except as set forth
on Section 4.9 of the Parent Disclosure Letter (true, complete and correct copies of which have been made available to the Company prior to the date hereof) and Parent, Merger
Sub and each QVC Group Subsidiary, as applicable, have complied with, and are now in compliance with, all such Orders, except in each case as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

        Section 4.10    Compliance with Applicable Laws.     

        (a)   Parent and the QVC Group Subsidiaries have since January 1, 2015 complied, and are now in compliance, in each case, with all applicable Laws, except as
would not reasonably be expected to be material to the QVC Group Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of Parent, (i) no investigation or review by any
Governmental Authority with respect to Parent or any of the QVC Group Subsidiaries is pending or threatened that would reasonably be expected to be material to the
QVC Group Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (ii), no Governmental Authority has indicated in writing to Parent prior to the date hereof an intention to conduct any such
investigation or review.

        (b)   Parent and its Subsidiaries (i) hold all material Governmental Permits necessary for the lawful conduct of business of the QVC Group Subsidiaries or ownership
of the QVC Group Subsidiaries respective assets and properties, and all such Governmental Permits are in full force and effect and (ii) are in material compliance with all
such Governmental Permits and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no such Governmental Permits are subject to any formal revocation, withdrawal, suspension, cancellation,
termination or modification action by the issuing Governmental Authority that would reasonably be expected to be material to the QVC Group Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

        (c)   Parent is not an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

        Section 4.11    Tax Matters     

        (a)   Holdings is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Holdings is treated as an entity disregarded as separate from Parent for U.S. federal income tax
purposes pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii). Parent has no plan or intention to take any action, or to cause Holdings to take any action, in
connection with the Merger that would have the effect of causing Holdings to be treated as other than an entity disregarded as separate from Parent for U.S. federal
income tax purposes.

        (b)   Holdings owns directly the Parent Shares. Other than the Parent Shares, Company Rights that were issued in respect of such Parent Shares, and any shares of
Company stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of Company Rights, none of Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent, or any person related (as defined in Treasury Regulations
Section 1.368-1(e)(4)) to Parent owns any shares of Company stock or any rights to acquire any shares of Company stock (except pursuant to the Agreement). Holdings
acquired all of the Parent Shares before January 1, 2012 in one or more transactions that were not part of a plan that includes the Merger.

          (i)  Engage in negotiations with, furnish any information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to and afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Person or group (and their respective Representatives) making such Alternative Company

Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange offer during the period referred to in this clause) or (D) other than with respect to a tender offer or exchange offer, fail to

abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this

subject to compliance with Section 5.2(e), solely in response to either (x) a Company Intervening Event or (y) a Superior Company Proposal, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or, solely in response to an Alternative Company Transaction Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) in order to enter
concurrently into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Company Proposal, if in either case the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith

other action pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 5.2(f) includes a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, it shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change for all purposes under this Agreement.

Charter and the Company Bylaws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company's obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3(b) (including its
obligation to hold the Company Stockholders' Meeting at which this Agreement shall be submitted to the Company Stockholders for adoption as aforesaid) shall
not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Alternative Company Transaction Proposal or
by a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i).

of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders' Meeting, (B) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Board of
Directors of the Company has recommended that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders' Meeting
and (C) neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of its Board of Directors that Company Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

        (a)    Access to Information.    Upon reasonable prior notice and subject to applicable Law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, each of the Company and
Parent shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries and each of its and its Subsidiaries' respective officers, directors and employees to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to, afford the other party hereto, and such other party's officers, directors, employees and Representatives, following
reasonable notice from the examining party in accordance with this Section 5.4, reasonable access during normal business hours to officers, employees, agents, properties,
offices and other facilities, books and records of each of it and its Subsidiaries, and all other financial, operating and other data and information as shall be reasonably
requested and, during such period shall furnish, and shall cause to be furnished, as promptly as reasonably practicable, a copy of each report, schedule and other document
filed or received pursuant to the requirements of the federal securities laws or a Governmental Authority, except, with respect to examination reports, as may be restricted
by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the neither party shall be obligated to disclose any information that, in its reasonable judgment, (i) it is not legally
permitted to disclose or the disclosure of which would contravene any applicable Law or Order or (ii) the disclosure of which could cause the loss or waiver of any
attorney-client or other legal privilege or trade secret protection (provided that the such party will use its reasonable best efforts to provide such disclosure in a manner
that would not have the effects described in the foregoing (i) and (ii)). The examining party shall be entitled to have its Representatives present at all times during any
such inspection. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.4 or information provided, made available or delivered pursuant to this Section 5.4 or otherwise shall affect
any representations or warranties or conditions or rights contained in this Agreement.

they shall not be required to cause any of their Subsidiaries to) make any material payments or incur any other material Liabilities (including becoming a guarantor of any
Contract) and (y) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall agree to make any payments or incur any other Liabilities, or make or agree to make any
amendment to the terms of any applicable Contract, in order to obtain any such consent, approval, authorization or waiver without the prior written consent of Parent;

        (b)    Notification.    Each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other party hereto reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) promptly notify the other

with any Governmental Authority or other third party with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) permit the other to review

such Governmental Authority or other third party, as applicable, gives the other the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, and (iv) furnish the other party hereto
with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the Company or Parent, as applicable, may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of
necessary filings or submissions of information to any such third party.

        (c)    No Divestitures.    In furtherance of the covenants set forth in Section 5.5(a), if any objections are asserted with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby under any domestic or foreign antitrust or Competition Law or if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice, the FCC or any other applicable Governmental Authority challenging the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby or which would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger, Parent shall take all reasonable actions necessary to resolve any
such objections or Actions (or threatened Actions) so as to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby as soon as reasonably practicable;
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no case shall the Company or Parent be obligated to (and the Company
shall not, without the written consent of Parent, and in no event shall Parent be deemed to have breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement solely for
refusing to) become subject to, consent to or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order to sell,
to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change its respective assets or business (including that of its Affiliates (but for
the avoidance of doubt excluding any Specified Persons or Permitted Holders, as to whom no such requirements, conditions, understandings, agreements or order shall
apply)) in any manner that, either individually or in the aggregate, (i), materially adversely affects the financial condition, business, or the operations of (x) the Company
and its Subsidiaries or (y) the QVC Group Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis and post-Closing basis, or (ii) prohibits or materially limits the ownership, control or
operation by (x) the Company and its Subsidiaries or (y) the QVC Group Subsidiaries of any material portion of its or their respective businesses or assets, or compels the
Company or Parent (with respect to the QVC Group only) to dispose of or hold separate any of its material businesses or assets or any portion thereof.

        (d)   The Company and Parent acknowledge that, to the extent reasonably necessary to expedite the grant by the FCC of any application for renewal of any low-
power television broadcast FCC license and thereby to facilitate the grant of the FCC Approval with respect to such low-power television broadcast FCC license, each of
the Company, Parent and their applicable Subsidiaries shall be permitted to enter into tolling agreements with the FCC to extend the statute of limitations for the FCC to
determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against such low-power television broadcast FCC

material or (ii) any other enforcement matters against such low-power television broadcast station with respect to which the FCC may permit the Company or Parent (or
any of their respective Subsidiaries) to enter into a tolling agreement.

        (e)   If the Closing shall not have occurred for any reason within the original effective periods of the FCC Approvals, and neither party shall have terminated this
Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain one or more extensions of the effective period of the
FCC Approvals to permit consummation of the transactions hereunder. Upon receipt of the FCC Approvals, the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to maintain in effect the FCC Approvals to permit consummation of the transactions hereunder.

        Section 5.6    State Takeover Statutes.     In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (a) take all reasonable action necessary to

Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby and (b) if any "fair price," "business combination," "control share acquisition" or other state takeover statute or
similar Law becomes applicable to this Agreement or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms required by, or provided for, in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        Section 5.7    Indemnification and Insurance.     

        (a)   For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the present and former directors,
officers, employees and agents of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and any individuals serving in such capacity at or with respect to other Persons (each, an
"Indemnified Person") from and against any losses, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) in respect of the Indemnified Persons'
having served in such capacity prior to the Effective Time, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other Law or provided under the Company
Charter and Company Bylaws, each as in effect on the date hereof. If any Indemnified Person is made party to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising
out of or relating to matters that would be indemnifiable pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall, and shall cause the Company to, advance fees,
costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) as incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with and prior to the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

        (b)   For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of directors,
officers, employees, fiduciaries and agents and advancement of fees, costs and expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding
provisions in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, each as in effect on the date hereof.

        (c)   From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and comply with their respective
obligations under any indemnification agreement with any Indemnified Person, and not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such

agreement in any manner that would materially adversely affect any indemnification right of any Indemnified Person thereunder.

        (d)   Neither Parent nor the Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual litigation, claim or proceeding
relating to any acts or omissions covered under this Section 5.7 (each, a "Claim") for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Person hereunder, unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified
Person otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent (such consent not to be unreasonably delayed, withheld or conditioned). The Company,
Parent and the Indemnified Persons shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish
or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith.

        (e)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain
and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance
policies and the Company's existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "D&O Insurance"), which D&O Insurance shall (i) be for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) be
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance and (iii) have terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against an Indemnified Person by reason of his or her having served in
such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby).
If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time, the D&O Insurance in place with the Company's current insurance
carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to D&O Insurance with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies, or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase
from the Company's current insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to
D&O Insurance comparable D&O Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided in
the Company's existing policies; provided that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an
annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the premium amount per annum for the Company's existing policies; and provided, further, that if the aggregate premiums
of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

        (f)    The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 5.7 shall be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the Company Charter or Company
Bylaws or any similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the Company, under Delaware Law or any other Law or under any agreement of any Indemnified
Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Person.

        (g)   If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7. The obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any successors or assigns under this Section 5.7 shall continue
in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time (or if later the expiration of all statutes of limitation applicable to any such claim); provided, that
if any Claim (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is brought against an Indemnified Person on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this Section 5.7 shall continue in effect until the full and final resolution of such Claim.

        Section 5.8    Public Announcements.     The Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing, and will provide each other the opportunity to review,
comment upon and concur with, and use reasonable best efforts to agree on, any press release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as either party, after consultation with outside counsel, may determine is required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or stock market if to the extent practical under the circumstances it has used reasonable best
efforts to consult with the other party prior thereto regarding the timing, scope and content of any such press release or public statement; provided, however, that no such
consultation shall be required for the Company to make any disclosure or otherwise take any action expressly permitted by Section 5.2. In addition, except (a) to the extent
disclosed in or consistent with the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3, (b) to the extent necessary to comply with
Parent's periodic reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, (c) for any consent given in accordance with this Section 5.8 or (d) as expressly permitted by Section 5.2, neither
party shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public statement or disclosure concerning the other party or the other party's business, financial condition or results of
operations without the consent of such other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The parties agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in the form agreed to by the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the issuance of any press release or
the making of any public statement with respect to which the foregoing consultation procedures have been followed, either party may issue such additional publications or press
releases and make such other customary announcements without consulting with any other party hereto so long as such additional publications, press releases and announcements
do not disclose any non-public information regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement beyond the scope of the disclosure included in the press release or public
statement with respect to which the other party had been consulted.

Section 3.19 to be true and correct at all times (and otherwise refrain from taking any action that would cause Section 3.19 to become untrue or incorrect at any time).

        Section 5.11    Employee Benefits.     

        (a)   For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall provide (or
cause to be provided) to each Company Employee who is employed with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a
"Continuing Employee") (i) an annual rate of salary, wages and/or commissions that is no less favorable than the annual rate of salary, wages and/or commissions
provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) incentive compensation opportunities (including annual incentives, equity-based
incentives and other performance-based compensation) and employee benefits (other than severance) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the incentive
compensation opportunities and employee benefits (other than severance) provided to such Continuing Employee during applicable periods prior to the Effective Time;
provided that, in lieu of equity-based incentives, Parent may provide cash incentives of substantially comparable value, and (iii) severance protections and benefits no less
favorable than the severance protections and benefits provided to such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        (b)   Each Continuing Employee who as of immediately prior to the Effective Time is eligible for an annual bonus for 2017 under a Company Plan (other than any
performance cash awards that are scheduled to vest on December 31, 2017 and were granted pursuant to the form of award agreement filed as Exhibit 10.24 of the
Company's Form 10-K filed February 21, 2013, which awards shall continue to operate in accordance with the terms thereof) and who remains employed with the
Company or Parent or its Affiliates through the regular payment date for such bonus or who experiences an Involuntary Termination (as defined below) after the Effective
Time and prior to such regular payment date shall receive, on such regular payment date, the following bonuses: (i) for the period from January 1, 2017 through June 30,
2017, a bonus in an amount determined based on the level of attainment of the applicable performance measures under such Company Plan measured as of the date hereof
against budgeted performance for such period (applying the budget in effect as of the date hereof), which bonus, for the avoidance of doubt, will be prorated to reflect the
number of calendar days during such period, and (ii) for the period from July 1, 2017 through the earlier of the Effective Time (or the last day of the month immediately
preceding the Effective Time, if the Effective Time does not occur on the last day of a month) or December 31, 2017, a bonus in an amount determined based on the level
of attainment of the applicable performance measures under such Company Plan measured as of such earlier date against budgeted performance for such period (applying
the budget in effect as of the date hereof), but in no event less than 70% of the target amount of such bonus, which bonus, for the avoidance of doubt, will be prorated to
reflect the number of calendar days during such period. If the Effective Time occurs in 2018, each Continuing Employee who as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time is eligible for an annual bonus for 2018 under a Company Plan and who remains employed with the Company or Parent or its Affiliates through the regular payment
date for such bonus or who experiences an Involuntary Termination after the Effective Time and prior to such regular payment date shall receive, on such regular payment
date, for the period from January 1, 2018 through the Effective Time (or the last day of the month immediately preceding the Effective Time, if the Effective Time does
not occur on the last day of a month), a bonus in an amount determined based on the level of attainment of the applicable performance measures under such Company
Plan measured as of the Effective Time (or the last day of the month immediately preceding the Effective Time, if the Effective Time does not occur on the last day of a
month) against budgeted performance for such period (applying the budget in effect as of January 1,

2018), but in no event less than 70% of the target amount of such bonus, which bonus, for the avoidance of doubt, will be prorated to reflect the number of calendar days
during such period. For clarity, Parent shall provide (or cause to be provided) to each Continuing Employee an annual bonus opportunity for the post-Effective Time
portion of the year in which the Effective Time occurs in accordance with Section 5.11(a)(ii). "Involuntary Termination" with respect to a Continuing Employee means
termination of such Continuing Employee's employment by the Company or Parent or its Affiliates without "Cause" or by such Continuing Employee for "Good Reason"
(as such terms are defined in the Company's Second Amended and Restated 2008 Stock and Annual Incentive Plan).

        (c)   With respect to any health or welfare plan maintained by Parent or its Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to participate at or after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) and their respective third party insurance providers to, (i) waive
preexisting conditions, limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods with respect to participation by and coverage of such Continuing
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) to the extent such requirements were waived or satisfied under the comparable Company Plans and (ii) for any group health
plan, recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during
the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment limitations. In addition, as of the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) to, provide each Continuing Employee full credit for purposes of eligibility, vesting, accruals and
determination of level of benefits under any employee benefit or compensation plan or arrangement maintained by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) that such Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time for such Continuing Employee's service with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, to the same extent that such service was credited for purposes of any comparable Company Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.11(c) shall be construed to require crediting of service that would result in (A) duplication of benefits, (B) service
credit for benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan, or (C) service credit under a newly established plan for which prior service is not taken into account for
employees of Parent generally.

        (d)   Without limiting the generality of Section 8.4, the provisions of this Section 5.11 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or
former Company Employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.11. No provision
of this Section 5.11 shall be construed as a limitation on the right of Parent, to amend or terminate any specific employee benefit plan that Parent would otherwise have
under the terms of such employee benefit plan, nor shall any provision of this Section 5.11 be construed to require the continuation of the employment of any particular
Continuing Employee. Nothing herein shall be deemed to establish, amend or modify any Company Plan, Parent Plan or other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates.

        Section 5.12    Tax Matters.     

        (a)    Certain Tax Matters.    Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(1)(B) of the Code. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the provision of tax representation letters substantially similar to the Company Tax
Representation Letter and the Parent Tax Representation Letter, respectively, to the Company's and/or Parent's counsel, as applicable, as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any tax opinion regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Merger that may be contained or set forth in the Registration Statement or
delivered to a Party in connection with the Closing. Except for actions specifically contemplated by this Agreement, none of the Parties shall (and each of the Parties shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries not to) take any action, or fail to take any

any such Taxes) imposed on the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall be paid by either the Company or the Surviving Corporation. The Company and Parent shall
cooperate in the preparation, execution, and filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires or other documents with respect to such Taxes.

occurrence of any event of which is likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to be untrue or inaccurate at the Closing
Date such that the conditions to closing set forth in Article VI would fail to be satisfied, and (ii) any failure by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to materially
comply with or materially satisfy any covenant or other agreement to be complied with by such party hereunder such that the conditions to closing set forth in Article VI
would fail to be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.13(a) shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be; provided, further, that a party's good faith failure to comply with this Section 5.13 shall not provide any other party the right
not to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent that any other provision of this Agreement independently provides such right.

        (b)   The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of (i) any notice or other communication received by it from any third party, subsequent to the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, alleging any material breach of, or material default under, any Company Material Contract or (ii) any notice or other material
communication received by it from any third party, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, regarding any consent that is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery such notice by the Company to Parent pursuant to this
Section 5.13(b) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Parent; provided, further, that a party's good faith failure to comply with this
Section 5.13 shall not provide any other party the right not to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to the extent that any other provision of this
Agreement independently provides such right.

        Section 5.14    Certain Litigation.     The Company shall promptly advise Parent of any Action commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its directors
by Company Stockholder relating to this Agreement or the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such
litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such Action and shall consider Parent's views
with respect to such Action, and shall not settle any such Action without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Parent shall not enter into any settlement agreement in respect of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or officers relating to the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the Company.

        Section 5.15    Section 16 Matters.     Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under
applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock or acquisitions of Parent QVCA Common Stock (including, in each case, securities deliverable upon
exercise, vesting or settlement of any Company Equity Awards or other derivative securities) resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby by each individual who is

to this Section 5.20(b) to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest and hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by Parent with respect to the Subject Securities.
Parent hereby ratifies and confirms all actions that the proxy appointed hereunder may lawfully do or cause to be done in accordance with this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this proxy shall automatically be revoked at the Effective Time. The parties acknowledge and agree that neither the Company, nor any of
its Affiliates, shall owe any duty (fiduciary or otherwise), or incur any liability of any kind to Parent or any of its Affiliates, in connection with or as a result of the

Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (i) transfer, assign, sell, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of (whether by merger, by tendering into
any tender or exchange offer, by testamentary disposition, by operation of law or otherwise) or consent to any of the foregoing ("Transfer"), or cause to be Transferred,
any of the Subject Securities, (ii) grant any proxies or powers of attorney, or any other authorization or consent with respect to any or all of its Subject Securities in
respect of any matter addressed by this Agreement, (iii) deposit any of the Subject Securities into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with
respect to any of the Subject Securities or grant any proxy or power of attorney with respect thereto that is inconsistent with this Agreement, (iv) enter into any Contract
with respect to the Transfer of any Subject Securities or (v) take any other action, that would restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of Parent's obligations
hereunder. Any purported Transfer of the Subject Securities in violation of this Section 5.20(c) shall be null and void ab initio.

by the Financing Counterparty in connection with a Financing Transaction, and any transfer to, by or at the request of such Financing Counterparty in connection with an
exercise of remedies by the Financing Counterparty under Financing Transaction. This Section 5.20 shall not be binding on any Person solely because such person is (i) a

case of this clause (ii), interpreted without giving effect to any Company Material Adverse Effect or materiality qualifications contained therein, except where all

required to be performed or complied with by it under this Agreement at or prior to the Closing Date.

         (ii)  any Governmental Authority shall have issued or granted an Order or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the Merger and such Order or other action is, or shall have become, final and non-appealable; or

        (iii)  the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the Company Stockholders' Meeting, or at any adjournment or postponement
thereof, at which the final vote thereon was taken; provided that, at the time at which the party seeking to terminate this Agreement seeks exercise such

        (c)   by the Company

          (i)  prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in order for the Company to enter concurrently into a definitive written agreement with respect to
a Superior Company Proposal as contemplated by Section 5.2; or

         (ii)  if, provided that the Company is not then in material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement, (A) a breach of any representation or
warranty or (B) failure to perform any covenant or agreement, in either case, on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred
that would cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b) to not be satisfied and such breach or failure is incapable of being cured by the Outside
Date or shall not have been cured within sixty (60) days after written notice thereof shall have been received by Parent; or

          (i)  provided that the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained, if (A) the Company shall have made a Company Adverse

or failure to perform leads to or results in an Alternative Company Transaction Proposal; or

         (ii)  provided that neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement, if (A) a breach of any
representation or warranty or (B) a failure to perform any covenant or agreement, in either case, on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement (other than
a breach or failure to perform contemplated by Section 7.1(d)(i)(B)) shall have occurred that would cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or
Section 6.3(b) to not be satisfied and such breach or failure is incapable of being cured by the Outside Date or shall not have been cured within sixty (60) days
after written notice thereof shall have been received by the Company.

        Section 7.2    Effect of Termination.     In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1 hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and of no effect and the obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall terminate, without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent,
consultant or representative of such party) to the other parties hereto; provided that, if such termination shall result from (a) the intentional failure of any party to fulfill a
condition to the performance of the obligations of any other party or (b) the willful material breach of this Agreement by any party, such party shall be fully liable for any and all
damages that are the natural, probable and reasonably foreseeable result of the event that gave rise thereto (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to
reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and may include the benefit of the bargain lost by the applicable party's stockholders (taking into consideration relevant
matters, including other combination opportunities and the time value of money)) incurred or suffered by the other parties as a result of such failure; provided, further, that

forth in Section 5.16(e), this Section 7.2 and Section 7.3 (Payments), as well as Article VIII (General), shall survive any termination of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge
and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor, and, in all events, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, or any other appropriate form of equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.12. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which
obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

        Section 7.3    Payments.     

        (a)    Company Termination Fee.    

          (i)  In the event that the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i),
then the Company shall pay Parent, within two (2) Business Days of the date of termination, a one-time fee equal to $40,000,000 (the "Company Termination
Fee").

         (ii)  In the event that (A) an Alternative Company Transaction Proposal shall have been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Company
Stockholders, Senior Management or the Board of Directors of the Company, or any Person or group of Persons shall have publicly announced an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make an Alternative Company Transaction Proposal, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) (if the Company Stockholder Approvals have not theretofore been obtained) or Section 7.1(b)(iii) or (y) by Parent pursuant to
Section 7.1(d)(ii)(B) and (C) prior to the date that is fifteen (15) months after the date of such termination the Company enters into a Company Acquisition
Agreement (whether in connection with the Alternative Company Transaction Proposal referred to in clause (A) or otherwise), and the transaction contemplated
by such Company Acquisition Agreement is later consummated, then the Company shall, on the date such transaction is consummated, pay to Parent a one-time
fee equal to the Company Termination Fee (provided that for purposes of this clause (ii), each reference to "10%" in the definition of "Alternative Company
Transaction" and "Company Acquisition Agreement" shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%")

        (b)    Parent Termination Fee.    In the event the Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) or Section 7.1(b)(ii) and, at the time of such termination,
(i) the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(b), Section 6.1(c) (as it relates to any Competition Law or the Communications Act) or Section 6.3(f) have not been satisfied and
(ii) the other conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and the conditions set forth in Section 6.3 have been satisfied (or, in the case of conditions that, by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, are capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur on the date of such termination), then Parent shall pay to the Company, within two (2)
Business Days of the date of termination, a one-time fee equal to $75,000,000 (the "Parent Termination Fee").

        (c)   The Company and Parent each acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if a party fails promptly to pay
to the other party any amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, such other party commences a suit that results in a judgment against
the failing party for the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3, the non-prevailing party shall pay to the prevailing party its costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3 from the date such payment was required
to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as

published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that any amount payable by the
Company or Parent pursuant to this Section 7.3 does not constitute a penalty, but rather shall constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate a
party for the disposition of its rights under this Agreement in the circumstances in which such amounts are due and payable, which amounts would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision.

        (d)   Subject to Parent's right to specific performance set forth in Section 8.12, (i) Parent's right to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 7.3(a) shall be Parent and Merger Sub's sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any former, current or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling Person, general or limited partner, shareholder, member, manager, director,
officer, employee, agent, Affiliate, assignee, representative or financing source of the Company or its Subsidiaries (any such Person, other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries, a "Company Recourse Related Party") for any damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise (other than any such failure with respect to which no Company Termination Fee is payable), and
(ii) upon payment of the Company Termination Fee, pursuant to the terms hereof, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any rights or claims against the Company or
its Subsidiaries under this Agreement, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and the Company have no further liability to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (and in no event will Parent or any of its Subsidiaries have any rights or claims
against any Company Recourse Related Party, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, arising out of this Agreement).

        (e)   Subject to the Company's right to specific performance set forth in Section 8.12, (i) the Company's right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 7.3(b) shall be the Company's sole and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, or any former, current or future direct or indirect equity holder, controlling Person, general or limited partner, shareholder, member,
manager, director, officer, employee, agent, Affiliate, assignee, representative or financing source of Parent or its Subsidiaries (any such Person, other than the Parent and
its Subsidiaries, a "Parent Recourse Related Party") for any damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise (other than any such failure with respect to which no Parent Termination Fee is payable), and
(ii) upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company shall not have any rights or claims against Parent or Merger Sub under this
Agreement, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and Parent have no further liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (and in no event will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have any rights or claims against any Parent Recourse
Related Party, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, arising out of this Agreement).

        (f)    Expenses.    Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each party shall bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether or not the Merger is consummated.

        Section 8.4    Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.     This Agreement (including the documents and the instruments referred to herein) (a) constitutes the entire
agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral (except the Confidentiality Agreement and the Clean Team Agreement), among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and neither party is relying on any other oral or written representation, agreement or understanding and no party makes any

circumstances provided in Section 7.2, is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties any rights or remedies.

        Section 8.5    Governing Law.     All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules of
conflict of laws.

        Section 8.6    Amendments and Supplements.     This Agreement may be amended or supplemented at any time by additional written agreements signed by, or on behalf of
the parties, as may mutually be determined by the parties to be necessary, desirable or expedient to further the purpose of this Agreement or to clarify the intention of the parties,
whether before or after adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders; provided, however, that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no
amendment shall be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by the stockholders of the Company or Parent without such further approval or
adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing
specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the time of the amendment.

        Section 8.7    Waiver.     No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a written instrument signed by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective;
provided, however, that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no waiver may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or
adoption by the stockholders of the Company or Parent without such further approval or adoption. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such party.

        Section 8.8    Assignment.     Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation

Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by the
parties to this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to
the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.

        Section 8.11    Failure or Delay Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.     No failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair
such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any
rights or remedies otherwise available.

        Section 8.12    Specific Performance.     The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
Law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement (without the obligation to post a bond therefor) and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the Company or the Company Stockholders be permitted or entitled to seek a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief to consummate the
Merger unless:

        (a)   all the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which would
be satisfied or are capable of being satisfied at the Closing and those conditions that Parent's or Merger Sub's breach of this Agreement has caused not to be satisfied),
have been satisfied or waived; and

        (b)   the Company has confirmed in writing that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger.

        Section 8.13    Waiver of Jury Trial.     EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE
AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

        Section 8.14    Consent to Jurisdiction.     Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit itself to the sole and exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of the
United States located in the State of Delaware) (collectively, the "Delaware Courts") in connection with any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in any of the Delaware Courts, (c) agrees not to plead
or claim in any such court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient forum and agrees not otherwise to attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction or venue by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees that it will not bring any action, suit, or proceeding in connection with any dispute,
claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in any court or other tribunal, other than any of the Delaware Courts.

"Company"), and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., a nationally chartered trust company (as successor to The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York banking corporation),
as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent").

        WHEREAS, the Company and the Rights Agent are parties to a Rights Agreement, dated as of December 23, 2008 (the "Agreement");

        WHEREAS, the Company proposes to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"), by and among
Liberty Interactive Corporation, Liberty Horizon, Inc. ("Merger Sub"), and the Company, providing for the merger (the "Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the Company,
with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation;

        WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, it is necessary and desirable to amend
the Agreement to exempt the Merger Agreement, the execution and delivery thereof, and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without limitation, the Merger, from
the application of the Agreement, in each case as set forth in this Amendment;

        WHEREAS, (i) Section 27 of the Agreement provides, among other things, that prior to the Stock Acquisition Date the Company and the Rights Agent shall, if the
Company so directs, supplement or amend any provision of the Agreement without the approval of any holders of certificates representing shares of Common Stock, (ii) pursuant
to Section 27 of the Agreement, an appropriate officer of the Company has delivered a certificate to the Rights Agent stating that the proposed amendments to the Agreement set
forth in this Amendment are in compliance with the terms of Section 27 of the Agreement, and (iii) pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and in accordance with Section 27
thereof, the Company has directed that the Agreement should be amended as set forth in this Amendment prior to the execution of the Merger Agreement; and

        WHEREAS, capitalized terms used in this Amendment without definition shall have the meanings given to them in the Agreement.

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:

individually, collectively or in any combination, shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring Person" by virtue of, or as a result of, a Permitted Event."

2. The definition of "Exempt Person" in Section 1(s)(i) of the Agreement is hereby amended to add the words "or with respect to acquisitions of beneficial

provided, however, that failure to notify the Rights Agent of the Effective Time shall not in any way have an effect on the time at which the Rights cease
to be exercisable pursuant to the foregoing sentence."

8. Section 13(c) of the Agreement is hereby amended to add the following at the end thereof:

ANNEX C 

Special Committee of the Board of Directors
HSN, Inc.
1 HSN Drive
St. Petersburg, FL 33729

Special Committee:

        You have requested our opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, to the holders of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
"Company Shares") (other than Excluded Shares, as defined below), of HSN, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), of the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) provided
for pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") proposed to be entered into by and among Liberty Interactive Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Liberty Horizon, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and the Company. The Agreement provides that
Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger" and, collectively with the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the "Transaction"), as a result
of which the Company will become a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and each issued and outstanding Company Share immediately prior to the effective time of the
Merger (other than (i) Company Shares held by the Company as treasury stock and (ii) Company Shares held by Parent and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the shares referred to
in clauses (i) and (ii), together with any Company Shares held by any Specified Person (as defined in the Agreement), Permitted Holder (as defined in the Agreement) or any
other affiliate of Parent, "Excluded Shares")) will be converted into the right to receive 1.65 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of Series A QVC Group Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the "Parent QVCA Shares"), of Parent. The terms and conditions of the Transaction are more fully set forth in the Agreement.

        We have acted as financial advisor to the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with the Transaction for purposes of undertaking a
fairness evaluation with respect to the Transaction. We will receive a fee for our services in connection with the Transaction, a portion of which was payable upon the execution
of our engagement letter, a portion of which is payable upon the rendering of this opinion and a substantial portion of which is contingent upon the consummation of the
Transaction. In addition, the Company has agreed to reimburse certain of our expenses arising, and indemnify us against certain liabilities that may arise, out of our engagement.

        We are a securities firm engaged directly and through affiliates and related persons in a number of investment banking, financial advisory and merchant banking activities.
In the past two years, except for our current engagement by the Special Committee of the Board of Directors, we have not been engaged to provide financial advisory or other
services to the Company, and, except in connection with such current engagement, we have not received any compensation from the Company. In the past two years, we have not
been engaged to provide financial advisory or other services to Parent or Merger Sub and we have not received any compensation from Parent or Merger Sub. We may provide
investment banking and other services to or with respect to the Company, Parent or their respective affiliates in the future, for which we may receive compensation. Certain (i) of
our and our affiliates' directors, officers, members and employees, or family members of such persons, (ii) of our affiliates or related investment funds and (iii) investment funds
or other persons in which any of the foregoing may have financial interests or with which they may co-invest, may at any time acquire, hold, sell or trade, in debt, equity and
other securities or financial instruments (including derivatives, bank loans or other obligations) of, or investments in, the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates, or
any other party that may be involved in the Transaction.

        In connection with this opinion, we have reviewed, among other things: (i) an execution copy of the Agreement dated July 5, 2017; (ii) Annual Reports on Form 10-K of the
Company for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 and Annual Reports on Form 10-K of Parent for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 (as amended) and
2014 (as amended); (iii) certain interim reports to stockholders and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of the Company and Parent; (iv) certain publicly available research analyst
reports for the Company and Parent; (v) certain other communications from the Company and Parent to their respective stockholders; (vi) certain internal information relating to
the business, operations, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of the Company, including certain financial forecasts, analyses and projections relating to the
Company prepared by management of the Company and furnished to us by the Company for purposes of our analysis (the "Company Forecasts") (collectively, the "Company
Internal Data"); (vii) certain financial forecasts, analyses and projections relating to the QVC Group (as defined in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Parent) prepared
by management of the Company and furnished to us by the Company for purposes of our analysis (the "Parent Forecasts"); (viii) certain financial forecasts, analyses and
projections relating to the QVC Group pro forma for the Transaction prepared by management of the Company and furnished to us by the Company for purposes of our analysis
(the "Pro Forma Forecasts"); (ix) certain internal information relating to the business, operations, earnings, cash flow, assets, liabilities and prospects of the QVC Group provided
by Parent's management and furnished to us by Parent (the "Parent Internal Data"); and (x) and certain cost and operating synergies projected by the management of the
Company to result from the Transaction furnished to us by the Company for purposes of our analysis (the "Synergies"). We have participated in discussions with members of the
senior management and representatives of the Company and Parent regarding their assessment of the Company Internal Data (including, without limitation, the Company
Forecasts), the Parent Forecasts, the Pro Forma Forecasts, the Parent Internal Data and the Synergies, as appropriate, and the strategic rationale for the Transaction. In addition,
we reviewed publicly available financial and stock market data, including valuation multiples, for the Company and Parent (including the Parent QVCA Shares) and compared
that data with similar data for certain other companies, the securities of which are publicly traded, in lines of business that we deemed relevant. We also compared certain of the
proposed financial terms of the Transaction with the financial terms, to the extent publicly available, of certain other transactions that we deemed relevant and conducted such
other financial studies and analyses and took into account such other information as we deemed appropriate.

        We have assumed, without independent verification or any responsibility therefor, the accuracy and completeness of the financial, legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other
information supplied to, discussed with, or reviewed by us for purposes of this opinion and have, with your consent, relied upon such information as being complete and accurate.
In that regard, we have assumed, at your direction,

that the Company Internal Data (including, without limitation, the Company Forecasts), the Parent Forecasts, the Pro Forma Forecasts and the Synergies have been reasonably
prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of the Company as to the matters covered thereby and that the Parent
Internal Data have been reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and judgments of the management of Parent as to the matters covered
thereby, and we have relied, at your direction, on the Company Internal Data (including, without limitation, the Company Forecasts), the Parent Forecasts, the Pro Forma
Forecasts, the Parent Internal Data and the Synergies for purposes of our analysis and this opinion. We express no view or opinion as to the Company Internal Data (including,
without limitation, the Company Forecasts), the Parent Forecasts, the Pro Forma Forecasts, the Parent Internal Data and the Synergies or the assumptions on which they are
based. In addition, at your direction, we have not made any independent evaluation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent, derivative, off-balance-sheet or
otherwise) of the Company or Parent, nor have we been furnished with any such evaluation or appraisal, and we have not been asked to conduct, and did not conduct, a physical
inspection of the properties or assets of the Company or Parent. We have assumed, at your direction, that the final executed Agreement will not differ in any respect material to
our analysis or this opinion from the execution copy reviewed by us. We have also assumed, at your direction, that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in
the Agreement and in accordance with all applicable laws and other relevant documents or requirements, without delay or the waiver, modification or amendment of any term,
condition or agreement, the effect of which would be material to our analysis or this opinion and that, in the course of obtaining the necessary governmental, regulatory and other
approvals, consents, releases and waivers for the Transaction, no delay, limitation, restriction, condition or other change, including any divestiture requirements or amendments or
modifications, will be imposed, the effect of which would be material to our analysis or this opinion. We have further assumed, at your direction, that the Merger will qualify for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We have not evaluated and do not
express any opinion as to the solvency or fair value of the Company, Parent or the QVC Group, or the ability of the Company, Parent or the QVC Group to pay their respective
obligations when they come due, or as to the impact of the Transaction on such matters, under any state, federal or other laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
matters. We are not legal, regulatory, tax or accounting advisors, and we express no opinion as to any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters.

        We express no view as to, and our opinion does not address, the Company's underlying business decision to proceed with or effect the Transaction, or the relative merits of
the Transaction as compared to any alternative business strategies or transactions that might be available to the Company or in which the Company might engage. We were not
requested to solicit, and did not solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination with, the Company or any other alternative
transaction. This opinion is limited to and addresses only the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of the date hereof, to the holders of the Company Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) of the Exchange Ratio provided for pursuant to the Agreement. We have not been asked to, nor do we express any view on, and our opinion does not address,
any other term or aspect of the Agreement or the Transaction, including, without limitation, the structure or form of the Transaction, or any other agreements or arrangements
contemplated by the Agreement or entered into in connection with or otherwise contemplated by the Transaction, including, without limitation, the fairness of the Transaction or
any other term or aspect of the Transaction to, or any consideration to be received in connection therewith by, or the impact of the Transaction on, the holders of any other class
of securities, creditors or other constituencies of the Company or any other party. In addition, we express no view or opinion as to the fairness (financial or otherwise) of the
amount, nature or any other aspect of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company or any party, or class of such persons
in connection with the Transaction, whether

relative to the Exchange Ratio provided for pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. Our opinion is necessarily based on financial, economic, monetary, currency, market and
other conditions and circumstances as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof, and we do not have any obligation or responsibility to update,
revise or reaffirm this opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. With respect to the Parent QVCA Shares to be issued pursuant to
the Exchange Ratio, we have not taken into account any feature of such shares other than the economic rights attaching to such shares. We express no view or opinion as to what
the value of Parent QVCA Shares actually will be when issued pursuant to the Transaction or the prices at which the Company Shares or Parent QVCA Shares will trade or
otherwise be transferable at any time, including following the announcement or consummation of the Transaction. Our opinion does not constitute a recommendation to any
stockholder of the Company or any other person as to how such stockholder or other person should vote with respect to the Merger or otherwise act with respect to the
Transaction or any other matter.

        Our financial advisory services and the opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company (in their capacity as directors and not in any other capacity) in connection with and for purposes of its consideration of the Transaction. The issuance of this opinion
was approved by the Centerview Partners LLC Fairness Opinion Committee.

        Based upon and subject to the foregoing, including the various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered, and qualifications and limitations set forth
herein, we are of the opinion, as of the date hereof, that the Exchange Ratio provided for pursuant to the Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Company Shares other than Excluded Shares.

governmental, regulatory or other consents and approvals necessary for the consummation of the Transaction will be obtained without any adverse effect on the Company or
Parent or on the expected benefits of the Transaction in any way meaningful to our analysis. We have assumed that the Transaction will be consummated on the terms set forth in
the Agreement, without the waiver or modification of any term or condition the effect of which would be in any way meaningful to our analysis.

        Our opinion does not address the underlying business decision of the Company to engage in the Transaction, or the relative merits of the Transaction as compared to any
strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company; nor does it address any legal, regulatory, tax or accounting matters. We were not requested to solicit, and did not
solicit, interest from other parties with respect to an acquisition of, or other business combination with, the Company or any other alternative transaction. This opinion addresses
only the fairness from a financial point of view to the holders (other than the Liberty Related Entities and their respective affiliates) of Shares, as of the date hereof, of the
Exchange Ratio pursuant to the Agreement. We do not express any view on, and our opinion does not address, any other term or aspect of the Agreement or Transaction or any
term or aspect of any other agreement or instrument contemplated by the Agreement or entered into or amended in connection with the Transaction, including, the fairness of the
Transaction to, or any consideration received in connection therewith by, the holders of any other class of securities, creditors, or other constituencies of the Company; nor as to
the fairness of the amount or nature of any compensation to be paid or payable to any of the officers, directors or employees of the Company, or class of such persons, in
connection with the Transaction, whether relative to the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the Agreement or otherwise. With respect to the shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock to
be issued pursuant to the Exchange Ratio, we have not taken into account any feature of such shares other than the economic rights attaching to such shares. We are not
expressing any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Parent QVCA Common Stock will trade at any time or as to the impact of the Transaction on the solvency or viability
of the Company, Parent or the QVC Group or the ability of the Company, Parent or the QVC Group to pay their respective obligations when they come due. Our opinion is
necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to us as of, the date hereof and we assume no
responsibility for updating, revising or reaffirming this opinion based on circumstances, developments or events occurring after the date hereof. Our advisory services and the
opinion expressed herein are provided for the information and assistance of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company in connection with its consideration
of the Transaction and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation as to how any holder of Shares should vote with respect to such Transaction or any other matter. This
opinion has been approved by a fairness committee of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC.

        Based upon and subject to the foregoing, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to
the holders (other than the Liberty Related Entities and their respective affiliates) of Shares.

Very truly yours,
